loved playing dirt  and i thought the graphics were good
purchased dirt  as an addition to the otherand the graphics are absolutely gorgeous  if you liked dirt or dirt you are going to love dirt   the game was easier to configure with my logitech wireless rumblepadand with my evga gtx  and all detail set to full on graphics at  x  i get over  fps
the game looks good plays well and is a blastim not quite finished with the games dirt tour mode but i believe ive experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer
and im happy to say that the game is indeed awesome
great cars great tracks and racing modes excellent gameplay and graphics
the highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in aspen
there are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement which are new to the seriesat first i felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike dirt  had where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty then lose big time on medium
then i found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from  levels of challenge then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options
basically you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you
love this feature
sadly there is no option to increase the  controllers dead zone or adjust the sensitivity
im doing ok as is but some tweaking would be idealmuch like the previous two games the handling is a bit flighty
but thats speeding on loose ground for you
still i feel things have tightened up somewhat since dirt   still no cigar but its a step forward
the game runs as smooth as silk on my ti wih all the settings maxed
no issues whatsoever
if you enjoy racing games this is not one you should ignore
its the best dirt so fari have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on pc
i currently have a logitech g force feedback wheel to play withi have played most of the colin mc rae need for speed grid and dirt games before
i also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like gtr gtr gp legendsdirt came in as a nice and pleasant surprise
dirt tops it offas i am sure many will detail everything about this game i will limit myself to the most important points for mepros amazing graphics amazing physics challenging but entertaining racescons gymkhana interfacewhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana
racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the necki saw the videos of ken block on youtube and indeed he is really impressive
am i even dreaming of doing the same
noracing require good racing skills to start but gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level
so i find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustratingnow what about the interface
simply put it does not remotely compare with dirts interface
it is messy i had to search online to figure out where to find my best times
there are not enough info about the cars the races the sponsors it leaves a lot to desire
a complete missconclusionas far as rallye racing
this game is the best out there todayif you are one who needs crazy challenges try the gymkhana and good luckin spite of my criticism i definitely do not regreat this purchasedirt  on dvdi collect racing games so had to add this to my collectionson wated one alsolot of people dont like rally because they already tried gran turismo game
to tell you the truth gran turismo rally physic is just boring boring boring
gran turismo only good for racing simulation but rally part is suck
dirt  amazed me how much fun it was and now dirt  with  time more race tracks than dirt   must buythis is a must have for any gamer
codemasters really hit a home run on this one
i would like to see f  be this good using the ego engine  and the physics model in this game is right on the money
this game is the reason everyone should buy the best graphics card they can afford
i am using a nvidia  overclocked and i have on order a  i want to run this game with everything on highest level
i swear to you that even with the    the graphics are very realistic and i really enjoy racing at ground level
this game makes codemasters the king of graphics realism
buy this game 
december    i saw my review of the internet and wanted to update it for you
first of all anyone with this program buy the extra environments and cars
it is money well spent and a first class job of an addon
i wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics
i bought battlefield  and it is good but not the standard of the ego  engine
codemasters are the king of graphics so far and i find that the more realism a game has the more adicted you will become
no other program running with all variables to the max looks like dirt  thank god for codemasters and i can hardly wait for grid  in the summeri bought this microphone to further enhance my rock band experience
i was not disappointed
it kept in tune well which was a problem i saw with other microphones and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind
i dont mind that it is not wireless since i wouldnt move around much anyways
also the fact that it doesnt have buttons didnt bother me mainly because i dont mind using a controller to navigate
i do think it could have been packaged better but i dont fault the microphone for it
overall a very simplistic yet functional design that works welli love it
use it all the time
really works perfectly with all games that you need a mic forworks greatanother cool thing even if a song doesnt have harmony parts for more than one singer you can still do fakeharmony as all mics plugged in remain active
however the backup singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesnt differentiate what mic is being used for lead unless there actually is a harmony part
meaning  if youre just singing to party you can use all three mics on any song and theyll all just be treated as lead
pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do
lol  its just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics
for this reason we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in
just dont expect a good score my grandkids and their parents love playing with the microphone along with the guitar we gotthis really is a lot of fun for everyone
would totally recommend getting this if someone has an interest in music singingwe bought this item for our wii
it does not work at all for it
 so that was a disapointment
we did decide to keep it though because it works wonderfully on our xbox great game
i love the storyline and graphics as well as the fighting style
minus the super long time it takes traveling the ocean this game is a blast and a musthave for any fan of the zelda franchisei played the original zelda as a boy
ive enjoyed a lot of good times playing this updated version with my  yr old son
great adventures and game play and luckily we can find tips for problems we confront on the internet
very well designed game that is user friendly
awesomelookin for a rpg
this is the game for you
filled with many hours of gameplay to find all the hidden items
casual gameplay unless you try to collect everything then its hardcore
good controls and challenging puzzels give this game its rateingocarina was almost beyond word
but this is a cruising powerful and fun rival
the worst thing about it is the seemingly endless confusing ocean
i do not look forward to trying to finger out witch island i have to go to in which order as i think there is an order
but i ignore all that for now and just enjoy the wonderful game
cruising blue waters mystery dungeons and i still enjoy exploring the islandsmy oldest grandson loves this game
i can remember playing it when i was young and it was good back then but even better nowthis product is very good and works fine
buy it if you want it
it lets your we display in hd format of p which looks alittle better than normal av cable it comes with
to the untrained eye you might not even notice the diffrencethis was exactly what was needed and has worked flawlessly since being received
i recommend it if you need onei got this to hook up me will to my inc hd tv it set it up to i not p but besides that its a grate cablethe movers packed my wii cables in a separate box so i couldnt find them
i ordered this as it would be quicker and i wasnt disappointed
it is inexpensive and it works
i did have my wii setup manual so it was no problem to get up and running right away
sometimes you get what you pay for and sometimes it is betterthe most amazing graphics you could see
if you own a flight simulator yoke andor throttle quadrent you can make your gaming experice easier
the crash effects may not show in trailers or videos but in the actual game you can see the damage
i higly recomend to purchase this product
happy sailing
to reader this is not a little little kids game it is comclacatedthis game is a good way on getting at the helm of the rms titanic and i am very well satisfied with it
i do hope that any of you who does decied ot buy it will also enjoy iti still have my silicone protective case and it hasnt let me down a single time
very durable high quality and hasnt rip at allcovers the controller more then others and is pretty durable great grip to it as well and keeps its color looks solidnice skin for xbox controllers makes them more slip free and smooth softer too good deal and nice stuff try oneim revising my earlier review
i had only rated my transaction  stars previously due to shipping problems
after the seller contacted me to do what they could to help with the problem i have to reconsider
they contacted me promptly and went above and beyond in their effort to make me happy
thank you
this was the second case ive purchased and would recommend it to anyone
thanks againive bought these before
they slip right on and unless you get one with an obvious defect they should last for years
these are a must have if you are afraid of your kids messing up your controllers
then again maybe they should get their own
lolput on my controllers so it would like not get wear and tear and they are great
buy
them
amazingmy brother had one of these for the longest time so i used his until he wanted it back
i found this a lil while ago and have been loving it ever since giving the controller much needed grip and makes holding it for long gaming sessions much more comfortableeasy install and feels great
the skin fits really well and functions properly
i did have to trim up around the triggers because they moved around while i used them but after that it was perfectmy son loves it he says it makes it more comfortable and easier on his hands for those marathon black ops  sessionsas soon as i slipped this on my controller i knew that id never take it off
it makes the controller much more comfortable in your hands and does not slip if you play for a long time and tend to get sweaty fingersi really like this skin
it makes the controller nicer to play with and looks nice as wellyes i would recommend this to a friendconsidering its just a rubber cover for the xbox  controller actually its made welland the pricenot bad at all
excellent product for an excellent controllerunlike others on this site these fit very good and the material is durable which is of utmost importance to me
im glad i found this itemput this on my controller no hand cramps after  hours of all night gaming
if you want to make the controller a little bigger and easier to hold this is what you wantit works perfectly
nothing is wrong with itnot sure what you can really write about this item it works fine i use it on the wii to play gamecube games and it works great and fast but the gamecube was always much faster than ps anywaybought this for an old  gamecube i recently won in an auction
seems to work just fine purchased a few more since it works and the price is rightworks great with my game cube
i havent tried it with a wii but by the description it should work there toojust right
works great  i ll be ordering again laters
hope you will still be there then
see youthis is a great and cheap memory card
it is what it isit is compatible for wii and gamecube its  mb  block memory
if you need one  but itgreat productworks great
cheap price and way more memory than on the nintendo make
really great for you retro fans out thereworks perfectly for the game cube i purchased
came very quickly and i would buy this again when i need toone of the largest memory cards for the gamecube
it works great and loads fast
no need for formatting at alli bought this because i recently bought a gamecube for old times sake
this memory card works great and was one of the cheaper cardsthe product was just as the picture and works fine
it is long enough to play comfortably at a distance
there is no delay in control using this productmy nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our wii
once i purchased the game for him we found out that the wii controllers wont work with the gamecube games when played in the wii
after doing a little research i realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card
once we got both of those the gamecube game that we bought finally worked
after playing the game for a bit while being tethered to the wii system because of the cable for the controller we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom
so we got these controller extension cables
he is happyand now i can sit back far enough to see my entire tv and avoid wielders burn in my retina
so simple yet so obvious a necessity given how freaken short the big n made their controllers cords
buy them now and heal your spinethese are great
if you have a wii and use your gamecube controllers these are a must have
i can sit on the couch and not have to lean in towards the console and have the freedom to move around
theyre perfecti play brawl and melee all the time with my siblings and friends and sitting squished together  feet from the tv was a pain
so i got these cables because it was cheep and could solve most of our problems with this even if it did not look like they would last long from some of the reviews
but when i got these they worked great and did not seem cheap at all
i expected there to be lag with the controls but there wasnt
they have survived a month of intense fighting and are still in topnotch condition
these are great if you need room or do not like sitting  feet from the screeni bought these to extend the length of the game cube controller reach
everyone that uses these has no issues with poor controller reaction times and can sit just about anywhere to playworks exactly as advertised
bought these along with a pack of controllers for the gamecube as my tv is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multiplayer with my wife
the controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller and the other end of the extension cable plugs into the gamecube which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semiviolently but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room just an example
one major concern i did have when i bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther
this concern was unwarranted as i have noticed no difference in response time either way
on durability ive had these for almost  years and they havent shown any noticeable signs of wear
throw in a reasonable price  when i bought it from amermedia in  and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this
i would recommendat  feet and at  dollars each its a good deal ive seen some other cables for much more and these work just fine i like that theyre black  and they connect into the controller with ease
buy it with confidencethis cable extender worked great
i used it when and had absolutely no problems with it at all
it adds a good ft of extra cable length
i tried hooking two together and i found no extra input lag using these cablesgreat if you need the extra cablewith the amount of interference i kept getting with the wireless controllers i was stuck far too close to the tv to enjoy many of the visual aspects of the classics
this cable extension cord made playing some of my old gamecube games just as fun as the day it came out
a big must have if you cant get the wireless format to work properlyi bought the  x wii gamecube gc extension cable cord  but after a few uses it started working wrong duplicating signalsif i press a in the controller the game detects a being pressed two times this is for all buttons  without the cord the error is no longer theretheyre awesome cables though
they work great and add those several feet you always seem to lack
now i can play my gamecube games on my wii from the couch
no batteries to changei purchased these for my wii as nintendo no longer produces wavebird controllers by virtue of them being sued by a patent owner over the technology
i didnt want to pay for a used wavebird on ebay so i bought some of these
i sit back from my hdtv about  feet so i needed these for the wired gamecube controllers and they work very well
even with mario kart wii there is some lag with the wavebird but there is no lag with these extension cables
highly recommendedi can now sit on the couch to play instead of putting a chair in front of the tv
there are no problemsfor people who still have a gamecube but dont have a wireless controller dont bother youll be disappointed because none of them come with the damn adapter these cords are fantastic
i can take my controller all over the house with them if i please and they dont cause lag or short out to any degree i can tell
theyre not shoddilymade and have lasted well so far
id buy them againthese awesomesauce things make any gc controller as far extended as a wavebird
given these days any games i have time to play are all via the wii anyway having the extra length for gc controllers is greati bought  sets of this product so  cables total
i was not disappointed
they all work perfectly and they accomplished what i bought them for
i have  big screen tvs and the  rooms i use for these have couches that sit back a lot further than the standard gamecube controller cord would reach
hook  of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved
i also like the length because i still had room to go back farther but this allowed each cord to rest on the ground so there is less of a tripping hazard for those people that never fail to walk in front of everyone and dont pay attention to the cords
they even work for bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those gamesi always hated how gamecube controllers cords were so ridiculously short
since i use them on my wii now it is much more hazardous for my wii if someone trips over the short cables
this was a perfect solution to my problems
so far i havent had any problems with them and they allow me and my friends to not sit  ft away from the wii
another great thing about these is that you can plug them end on end to make a longer cablethis isnt a particularly deep product
they are wire extenders to be used for the nintendo gamecube controllers
they come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price
they extend approximately  feet in length and with the already fairly long wire on the gamecube controller already these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room
i have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller
getting these beats paying the higher price for the wavebird wireless gamecube controllers
im on a budget so ill just stick with a wired controller no big dealthe gamecube controller wire is length has always been annoying
once got these that solved that problem
they work great fit right and do not cause any controller lag
great buythis really cam in handy we need a extra length for the controller and it was perfect exactly what we neededthese extenders work as expected
i bought them when i wanted to buy double dash for the game cube to play on my wii
if youre used to playing the wii you probably sit much further away than a standard gc controller will reach so definitely pick some of these uphavent play for long time and love this game as enjoy play
it good play game i guess well alrightso glad i ordered this game it was like nostalgia overload of awesome it helps that it was in perfect condition with the case and booklet and got here super fast
one of the best rpgs i have ever played
and just a heads up you totally can not beat the two unicorn bad guys in the beginning no matter what the internet tells you so dont wast  hours trying tobreath of fire iiis oldschool graphics capture the feel of old rpgs and how good they were playing on nes and super nes back in the old days
now  i still play snes playing such good games as super godzilla breath of  fire i and the final fantasy series
the storyline goes as followsryu is  a survivor of an ancient race of dragons the brood which nearly destroyed  the world
however he is a good dragon
he allies himself with yraall  region thieves rei and fellow dragon teepo who at the time doesnt know  hes a dragon
he aligns himself with the young princess of wyndia  princess nina and the daughter of a smart scientist momo a mutated  vegetable named peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game  and a guardian of urkan tapa whos race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war garr
together they quest to find ryus origin and other  members of his race and to find out if ryu is evil or not
with beautiful  music surroundings and a great storyline this is one of the best rpgs of  allwith many minigames abound and a fantastic battle system
definitely  get this if youre a fan of capcom rpgslove the game thanksthis game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat
thanksthis game is one of my all time favorites i give it a  in the rpg genre
it is a turn based rpg that is fun to play
i own this game for the psp and the now the ps
this game is a rare find in good condition
if you find a better rpg than this besides the final fantasy games of course let me knowbreath of fire iii is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought
i can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation
innovation is necessary and appreciated but games like bof need never disappear
it caters to the oldtime gamer in all rpg veterens delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay
and what gameplay
its simplicity and charm will hopefully impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit
last i must mention the fishing system
its incredibly addictive simple and enjoyable
nothing else could more easily describe it
throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait and youd have a full game that i would have to own
its that good
for everyone whether an rpgnewbie or a hardcore veteren you should give this game a chance
fun doesnt begin to describe itmany may disregard the breath of fire series as just another rpg but capcom has done a beutiful job with this title
they pulled out a lot on this case
beutiful d graphics that only capcom can do good music simple controls make this an excellent purchase
chances are you may find this at a good price somewhere so i say go for itquotbreath of fire quot is a very interesting and well made game
the plot is pretty good and the characters are interesting and memorable
one thing i do miss from the older quotbreath of firequot is the way they transformed into dragons the process in the current game is excellent i just prefer the older methods
my favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character and then later in the game you get to play a more mature version of the same character
this game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genrestreet fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series
should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridgedisc of the six games contained on the two sf collections then do so and spend a ton of cash
they are all excellent titles but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect
street fighter collection the original that is in the spotlight is actually the more uptodate one
while it does not contain the original street fighter ii it does contain  classic street fighter games
first is super street fighter ii the new challengers released on snes and genesis in  it was mindbendingly good the first time i played it
it had a solid  fighters
all  from street fighter ii the bosses plus  new characters never heard of before cammy dee jay fei long and t hawk
you might think oh wow a new edition with new fighters
never seen that before
well youre wrong
super street fighter ii did contain  new arenas respectively the ones for the new fighters
it also had newly mixed music newly animated profile shots and newly animated backgrounds
basically it was a perfect upgrade
super street fighter ii turbo is also included
it may seem like super street fighter ii with the speed like street fighter ii turbo but it added something
each character had one super move
from ryu and kens shinkuu hadoken to chun lis kikousho they really gave a great new edge to the series
akuma is even hidden in this upgrade
also the definitive of the three street fighter alpha games street fighter alpha  gets upgraded to street fighter alpha  gold edition
cammy is added on and evil ryu becomes playable yay
whats strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their sfiice animation
so its definetely worth picking this upif you dont already have all three of these games for your snes alpha  is also on the psthe one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that if you notice the collection is a collection indeed and a fine one at that but mostly shows how the street fighter series evolved
if you note that it goes from super street fighter ii to ssfii turbo to sf alpha  gold
well my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with super combos added
st it starts with super ii no supers at all just classic then goes to super ii turbo where the super combo made its debut and every body had only one super then goes to alpha  gold where it really shows what you can do with a super combo plus more characters and every body had atleast  super comboslets go over itst  classic with no supers lots of charactersnd  classic with supers making debut same amount of charactersrd  advance from nd with more characters and  supers for eachnot only that but its a classic game mostly to me just an example of the evolution of the series if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be get the nd one otherwise its a wise decision to go with this onelooking anywhere else people will charge more than  for an old wonderful game like this
classic games like these are hard to come by wish i had traded in less of my games when i was youngmegaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing megaman into the d realm on the original playstation
however this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there
in fact it has a lot in common with zelda ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a megaman game
coming from the nes and snes megamans i never thought i would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well
its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own waymost people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well
the only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most  and before graphics
kinda a d playable anime style to it
the sound isnt to bad in this game
voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andthe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good
however there is moments without any music
technically speaking i would say the game has aged wellthe thing i find most memorable about this game is the gameplay
like i mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements
there is a open world which was decent in size for its time which the game takes place in a small town
there are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment
speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs attack fire rate etc in a rpg like menu
with that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game
there is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms
the bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeonsas for the story it isnt to bad
it is a little childish but its still pretty good
the characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable
tron bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs capcom  and appearing without megaman in the rd
there is also a n port of this game which isnt as good but if you dont have a psx its still playable plus a sequel
anyway while the hardcore bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this gamethis game was very good
the first d megaman game to be releasedi remember playing this when i was  the story was great and i played it through more times than i can remembermegaman legendsthis is my undisputed favorite game of all time
i bought it in  or so because i had played and lovedmega man for thenintendo nes system  video game consolewhen i was young
this game was nothing like that game or any other megaman games
it was in d and had a story that would blow your mind
i have played through this game around  times and no every single part of it by heartgraphics the transition to d for megaman isnt an ugly one but a decent one
most of the trees have a d look to them and a lot of characters are blocky
still you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all
not to mention there is hardly any load time to wait through in this gamestory you are megaman volnutt
roll casket and her grandpa barrel casket have raised you since they found you when you were a child
following barrels footsteps megaman and roll become diggers
diggers are people who search through ruins infested with reaverbots to find parts and other things
the main thing a lot of diggers are looking for are refractors which are extremely powerful crystallike objects that power society
the world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around
megaman roll and barrel crashland their flying ship the flutter on an island called kattelox
you go on to discover the islands many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry piratessound the music and sound effects in this game are decent
nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death
some tunes even become catchy like the apple market tunegameplay you play as megaman exploring ruins fighting pirates and just helping people out
there are a lot of side quests you can do
you can join a secret gang fill a museum with underground arts help a little girl recover play in game shows and so much more
the main storyline has you exploring the subgate ruins in hopes to learn more about the islands great treasure or disaster
while in subgates you can find all kinds of items to do things with
its not just in the subgates either you can search in other digging sites for parts
you have a primary weapon called a buster gun which can be upgraded with  buster parts initially
these buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your buster guns shooting
you have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well
you will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect abilitydifficulty  note this is how much i like the difficultysince this game is more story based the difficulty is slight
there is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die minus a few bosses
once you beat the original game you can go back and play it on a new hard mode option
the game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble
also to top it off the game isnt that long
even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then  hours
that includes the main storyline and all side quests minus special weapon upgrading
i can now beat the game on hard mode in around  hoursoverall despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound its still  stars
the games storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesnt even matter
youll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over againmega man legends revolutionized the blue boy wander forevermegas st d appearencei strongly suggest that you buy this game is an awesome pricein the gamemega man is looking for the quotmother loadquotthe greatest prize of quotdiggersquotmega man also thinks that if they find itit might help solve the mystery about rolls pastin the gameyou can find air shoesthe famous x quotdashquotand the famous helmetyou start with mega man having no helmetbut thts cool
you can also get special weaponslike the sword and a drilli would say thisand this onlybuy this game nowgame works great amazing story that brings back childhood memories i love it
awesome game to have that is old schoollegends is one of the rare megaman releases that takes place in a d world as opposed to the traditional d side scroller most mm fans are familiar with
both legends and legends  are among some of the best made story driven d adventure games the psx has in its massive and sometimes daunting libraryi already own this game but its in terrible condition
this is due to me lending it out which is something i certainly dont do anymore
my favorite megaman game period along with  i had to get it again
and i have no regrets
besides i have  copies of the game now one with only case and disc that have seen their better days and a newer complete copy that reminds me of my original copy in its primei love ryu i love wolverine ryu invented the fire ball not goku goku who
you could suuuuper juuump and throoow fire balls fire balls bring out your second character fire poweri bought it to complete my set of batman games for the ps
i would recommend it to anyone who collects batman gamesive played this game on my pc when i was really young
i thought it was actually creepy which i kinda still do
i just love the myst series and this is my favorite
i got it for ps to play on my ps and its still that awesome game i remember it as
the case i got it in was pretty broken but its just a case
that can be replaced
i really wish they still made games like thisever since i was young i have been in love with the tekken series
brings back a lot of good memories
i bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun
though the graphics arent as top notch at games these days are but its still an entertaining game to play
if you collect either tekken stuff or video games this is a must ownthis game was great
though it doesnt compare to its original arcade machine this home version is nice anyway
the fights are all fun the graphics still look fantastic even though this game is nearly a decade old now and the characters are all good and the storylines are all interesting
to unlock the bosses which is the main thing you have to beat them all with their already available counterparts
the first time you beat heihachi which is the main boss for this game you get him unlocked
but the rest of them you have to play as the counterparts to get their bosses
even with the playstation  and x box and state of the art systems like that on the market many of the games they put out today cant compare to classic games like this
this is one of the alltime greatest fighting games ever and i dare say this might be the best of the tekken series
even has great musicnever actually owned the original tekken but i played it
since im the best tekken player in the universe ive decided that i want to own the game that started it allfrom the cool first cutcene to the classic music that plays while picking a character you know this is specialdont just button mash learn the combos because this is the only gameout of that has made me curs at the tv
if youre a beginner start of with someone with fast kicks like marchial law and not jack  buy this because its an absolute classici really like playing this game with my son
he has so much fun with itall i can say is that this game is a classic possibly the best game ever made for the playstation well i just recently bought this game again after finding it broken from unkown causes quite a few years ago
people keep on saying tekken  has horrible graphics and the gameplay is horrible
 to those people did you ever think that this game came out during the s and was probably awesome graphics back then
if youre a fan of good fighting games i reccomend this
it has lots of characters fair graphics and is a good collectible for your tekken collectionever since i was young i have been in love with the tekken series
brings back a lot of good memories
i bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun
though the graphics arent as top notch at games these days are but its still an entertaining game to play
if you collect either tekken stuff or video games this is a must own
this sequal is too good to miss out on
buy it before its gone for goodthis game was a very good game
but this aint as good as tekken  like its predecessor has great graphics great looking moves and great bosses to unlock which gives you a reason to wanna win the game with every character
the music is great here too
this is a definite gem
get this and its predecessor for the ultimate gaming experiencethough this review may be  years  laten my opinion tk is the best of the ps tekken gamesfrom the cool fmv intro  the ending credits tk is by far the best lookingsounding d fighting game on the ps consoletk backgroundsmusicfmv cinemaslight source shadinganimationscombos just doesnt measure  the standards set by this  classic and it was release  years latergo figurei remember tekken  being one of my first fighting games i have ever played and one that i kept coming back to
it wasnt just the nostalgia that kept me coming back but the overall gameplay as well
almost everything about this game was done right and there is very little to complain abouttekken  takes place  years after the events of the first tekken
the plot isnt very well developed and isnt really involving but everything else more than makes up for it
the graphics for the time were amazing and the animations were also nicely done
the roster includes  characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced
the game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it
the controls are simple and intuitive and i always believed that this control scheme each button controls a limbex
left punch right punch is one of the best for fighting gamesfor modes you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters
you also have a vs mode a team battle mode which is very enjoyable a survival mode a time attack mode and a practice mode
all of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modesthe combat system is still excellent to this day
the amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed
there also arent really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken such as excessive jugglingoverall this game is one of the best fighting games that i have ever played
with plenty of characters to learn plenty of modes to choose from amazing looking backgrounds and a terriffic combat system there is no reason to skip this game
if you still have a psps buy this game
i recommend this game wholeheartedly and you wont regret it at allthis is my familys favorite fighting game
from my six year old daughter on up to my yr
old son they love this game
the graphics along with the sounds and moves are excellent also there is a great character selection to choose fromthe sequel to the very popular tekken tekken  takes everything that the original had and expands upon it
more characters more levels more moves tekken  is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game loverthe combat in tekken is one of best ever
there are so many possible combinations its almost impossible to remember them all
each tekken gets better and better
another thing i love about this game is the music
it suits the stages and characters welltekken  it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter tekken this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for
not only theat but it had a plethera of gameshark codes to make the game easier
this game also introduced the  hit combo the automatic win
namco has done it again and they have done it with flying colors this game is a must have for the fighting fanssame goes for tekken  played but never owned
now that im officially the best tekken player period the urge to own all of them even the first  just consumed mewhat is there to say
this game has everything you want in a fighting game
plenty of characters to choose from and the gameplay is top notch for a ps game
definitely one of my favoritesthis game works great on my ps i would recommend this game for all arial fighting game thanks again love you guys thanksthis has got to be the best one of the playstation one seriescant wait for my ps to arrive to continue the serieshopefully they will be better than ace combat  which was an utter disappointmentthis is an excellent game for spending some time on
i have played it before on a demo cd long ago so thats why i decided to buy it
its about passing missions and destroying planes bases ships etc
it find it very fun
the missions happen in different ambiences and time of the day which makes it more interesting
you can get new planes with different attributes according to what you want
a great title for the psthere seems to be a curse on ace combat akin to that on the star trek movies
and by that i mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable while the even numbered save perhaps zero but zero is the absence of value right
are stellar
ace combat  awesome
ace combat  uneven and over too quick
ace combat  perfect
ace combat  had half the missions removed for the us release
ace combat  air combat
stone age
and ace combat if youre into classic gaming and love the playstation and especially if you love air combat games this is a definite buy
the sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful
you have night missions sea missions desert missions highaltitude missions ravine missions and ohsowonderful cityliberation missionive said it before and ill say it again theres more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are
graphics even lowres graphics can and should be beautiful
and beautiful this game is in all its playstation polygon glory
the lighting the jets the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky its all just beautiful to me at least
and better yet unlike other air combat games of the era everything moves at a rocketing speed
even when you get close to the ground where other games look like youre moving in slow motion the game keeps a great sensation of speedthe controls are uniformly tight utilizing the analog controls to the full
and you can bank and pitch completely upside down something that many similar arcadestyle games of the time dont allow
the game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more
theres also voice chatter as you go some nice arcade style music and full voice command briefings nice
of course you also hear bingo
every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too but thats just keeping with the arcade feel
the enemy ai
might not be as good as you can get now but its definitely good for when this game came out and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and dont watch yourselfin my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game
if you love arcade style air combat games and play playstation games you just have to get this gamethis is a pretty fun game
if you like hardcore killing games then this is for you
this game rocksive played this game when i first got the playstation around the year of  first mature rated game and after all of these years i return back to the dungeon to claim victory
luckily i did
deathtrap dungeon is not for the gamer who is use to fps fighters or d games that runs on the quake engine
this game is for collectors of games when they were in the early stages of become platinum hits in the world of gaming as of today
the game works fine but keep in mind that when you order this game get ready for a journey and one heck of a challenge
its not hard but this is a game that you really need patience withthis game is very fun
i have only played a demo that my cousin has but im dying to pick up a copy
the demo is short and we like to come up with different themes to it like were going to a party at the building at the end of the demo
this game is kind of funny
some of the enemies are pure fools
i like to run around the van with them chasing
then i turn around and and knock the crud out of them
i like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies
thats pretty funny too
the characters have awesome moves
i love fighting games and this is one of my favorites
if you like fighting games and games that are just plain fun buy this gamei played this game when i was a kid and forgot all about it
then remembered it ordered it and have been having fun playing itgot the game
after i came home from work it was on the kitchen table
my brother probably got to the mailbox first
i hope it is good
my little nephew wanted to play it with mealrighty let me just start off by saying dont let people who play final fantsay  sway your judgement about this
while final fantsay  is an amazing game it varies very heavily from fighting force so what some people like fun fighting gamesand others love rpg gamers we are at war with the worlds
its better to agree to disagree here
okay let us begin with the review
i love this game
from the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character mace daniels is my personal favorite to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy
it is ingenius
i love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really snazzy throwsblocks
like people have said it is like a streets of rage for the now
let me break it down overall for yougraphics compared to now it is not up to bar
compare it to when it frist came out bar none
 although the animation can sometime slow downsound aint nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch
control obviously this is the blacksheep of the family
the controls are clunky and choppy and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience
thank god for infinite health codes
 ouchoverall aside from the controls being what they are the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beatemup
i feel this game is totally undercredited and that we need to change that
only you can prevent forest firesthis game lacked the ability to live up to name tomb raider its more of a city raider half the levels deal with citytime scenery
and  of the enemies are humans
more like a  than a tomb raider  but the game play is fun in the cities venice so i cant complain too much  just wasnt feelin the whole china scene
i liked to level skip those
and the twist at the end was a lil boost  so all in all ill give it stars  but it lacked challenge for me  i beat it in a week
just run around and jump for the most parttomb raider  is my absolute favourite playstation game of alltime
i bought the game in december  around the same time i got my playstation
but i never really liked tomb raider  and only managed to get halfway through the first level before forgetting about it for a while
four years later in the summer of  i dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide
what a shock i gotafter the phenomenal worldwide success of the original tomb raider in november  the eidos interactive guys put together the sequel which in a rare case surpasses the original with flying colours
to save the game in the first you had to find a crystal before continuing wheras in tomb raider  you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like
this comes as a great help especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes
lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game
the first game featured pistols shotgun and uzis  that was about it
but with this game you get weapons such as the grenade launcher and an m assault rifle
while tomb raider  focused more on enemies in animal form tomb raider  has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human
but the most notable change on tomb raider  is the welcome addition of vehicles
tomb raider featured none what so ever but tomb raider  has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in venice and the snowmobile in tibetian foothills
lara also took advantage of a makeover
the graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game but lara herself has changed a lot her hair is no longer tied in a bun but flows freely down her back in a pony tail
the reason this wasnt featured in the first game is because the technology wasnt good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail  they couldnt get it to move in motion with her body rather silly when you think about it now
lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces
the improved engine also served better lighting facilities which allowed ms croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas
when it comes to the levels the highlights are venice offshore rig tibetian foothills short but sweet  involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level barkhang monastery hint whatever you do dont shoot the monks they are here to help
they will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you dont have to kill them
accidently shoot one and youll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you
and temple of xianoverall grade tomb raider  is in my opinion the greatest playstation game there has ever been
yes the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since  especially on the playstation  and xbox but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is
and in that category it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever
hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the tomb raider games and fail miserably
buy this now from amazon  itd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all timethey took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good
these games are still great for people looking for a challenge but i would advise firsttime players to play the series in order as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficulttolearn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you need to know in order to play the next as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises
but even though there isnt as much actual tomb raiding in this one it is definitely a step up from the previous version
also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where laras house is raided by a mafia strike team
although does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game
the extended version has two more levels but its only for the pcfrom the great wall of china to the canals of venice tomb raider ii is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original
in fact i find this game to be my favorite of the series
in it the legendary lara croft sets out to find the dagger of xion
in her quest she navigates the globe and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worldstomb raider ii offers significant improvements over the original and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series
the game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence
though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions they still are quite difficult
lara has new moves many new weapons and more dangerous foes
what more could a tomb raider fan  or even the casual gamer  ask fori highly recommend this game whether you are an avid tomb raider fan or somebody new to the series
i dont believe you will be disappointed  in fact you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment
and if you do enjoy it i strongly recommend other games in this seriesthis game is great to get into and back again never mind
so the levels are great you get to go tibet china venice and a sunken ship
the background is not so good but its okand you get small heath and large heath packs
these heath packs will be somewhere in the game keep a good eye out for themarm yourself withautomatic pistols harpoon gun rocket launcher m rifle uzis shotguns flares and morekill them or be kill bymonks yetis great white sharks killer eels dobermans and more
be careful please
your quest is for the dagger of xianits hidden somewhere out there i know do youand the good news is lara is backi recently started replaying this game to find that it is actually quite fun
i remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention
i just thought of it to be boring and hard
but since i remembered it i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure keep it
so i did
anyways when i started it up i remembered everything about the first mission very hard especially without anymore ps memory cards
when i finally beat the first mission
the wall it sadly took me hours because after those tumbling rocks after you you got ran over easy and died
every time you die you have to restart the whole mission so this is what took me the most time
soon i got on to the second mission i got pretty far but then the disc old and scratched up quit on me
it kept freezing
i have had this problem many times before on the first mission so i had to restart it back up again
after that i pretty much quit
this is why i keep all of my games in their cases
so they will work about  years later
sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing well the missions in speedy time
and saw how good the game layouts and graphics were
i really enjoyed this game well the first couple missions of it
so maybe i will buy a ps memory card and start to savin soonthe first tomb raider was a classic in terms of its d gameplay sense of exploration through massive levels and a unique main character
the nd installment in the tr series is not much different
the levels are still huge and exploration is still the name of the game
but this time around the environments and enemies are more varied there are more actionbased enemy sequences than the first and the difficulty level has been approriately increased
in terms of the level of challenge i feel that this is the best in the series
the later tomb raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times
this one is definitely not a cakewalk but is very possible without a strategy guide
you dont feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room
progress is slow but steady and you dont ever need  or  different items to move on
progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches
some of the level designs are incredible such as the venicebased levels the opera house the beastly barkhang monestary and the massive temple of xian
this is the key strength of the first two tr installments and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring
resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key as medipacks are in light supply in this game
also every level has  secrets in the form of dragons
you do not receive the bonus items unless you find all  dragons in the level making exploration even more vital in building your inventory
finding at least  of the dragons in every level should be quite easy but some levels have one especially wellhidden dragon
the gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult but the reward of finding them especially the first one is worth it
if you didnt like the first tomb raider this game wont change your mind
if you were blown away by the first installment or even the rd th or th then this game is a real treati recently backtracked and played all of the earlier tomb raider games
avoid angel of darkness
horrible game  tr is about as fun as they come
graphics are outdated of course but there is so much to do and to much fun to be had
the game is long keeps your interest has plenty of cool weapons and a good story
id love to see this game redone with todays technology
 out of if youre a tr fan and havent played this id advise that you dotomb raider  is by far the best sequel game out right now
lara kicks way morein this one then in the first
some of the reasons why are listed hereexcellent d levels such as  the great wall
venice
bartollis hideout
opera house
offshore rig
diving area
 fathoms
wreck of the mario doria
living quarters
the deck
tibetan foothills
barkhang monestary
catacombs of the talion
ice palace
temple of xian
floating islands
dragons lairepilouge home sweet homekickweapons like pistolsuzismagnumsshotgungrenade launcherm machine gunharpoon gunawesome new enemys like trexsraptorsguardian of the talionand a dragontomb raider  is an awesome game but my favorite in the series has to be tomb raider below i have included a list in order of my favorite tomb raider games tomb raider  tomb raider  last revelations
tomb raider  tomb raider  chronicles
tomb raiderthis is a good game here and i recommend it to anyone who likes adventure type games
 out of a major tomb raider fan i decided to play all the games over again and finished both part one and now part two and theyre both still as great as i remember
i think both are strong and worthwhile games with great plots but tomb raider two is more tough but thats the point of a sequel
its longer or at least it felt that way especially when it came to the ocean part of the game yet i enjoyed playing itboth tomb raider one and two have interesting plots and both are different
in tomb raider two it has to deal with a dagger that throughout the story grows more important to find and soon
you go through many different levels than you did on tomb raider one including the floating islands which is one weird level but very fascinating
my favorite levels were in venice the places in tibet and yes the floating islands
home sweet home level was a little scary being attacked in her own home but i thought it was a good twist
the ending itself was tougher than the first one thats for sure and i did say a few curse words while trying to finish the game but eventually when i did finish i knew that it was worthwhile
i had to get a strategy guide nonetheless to beat this game because indeed in many levels it was a little too tough for me to figure out but then theres no shame in getting a little helpoverall the game is more hard and challenging and just as creative in plot as part one was the storylines are way good
i enjoyed it and i recommend it to everyone who loved part onethis game is amazing
the level design and all the awesome puzzles make this game the best tr game ive ever played
this one is perfect to start if you are too young and never had a chance to play the tomb raider classics from ps
after playing this one play  then   then  tomb raiderthe best series ever
especially the classics ones from   this is one of those classic games that everyone who was a fan of playstation  must own aside from the st tomb raider of course
got it used but it works greata game that set the standard for the series imo clearly the newest one out there set the bar for the entire franchise thoughya know i remember playing this game as a kidi couldnt find this game anywhere and i didnt want to continue playing the anniversary or the windows version so i decided to buy this game as a kidit has a great storyline and for everyone who likes indiana jones then youd love this gamepros or conseasy to maneuverchallenging puzzles in which you have to think dont worry because its not like balders gate or anything that brainstorming unique storyline involving atlantiscons or proslow quality graphics then again it is from the ps so dont expect  bit graphicsno music except for select portions where there are orchestral themessurrealismconstant element of surprisepersonally i like most of the cons but those are most of the things people ive known complained aboutalso if anyone buys this game then i have to tell you this please if youre gonna use cheats then at least beat the game before doing soif i could have give  stars for this game i would have
i played this originally when it first came out in   back then games such as resident evil and tomb raider were groundbreaking milestones in entertainment known as video games
i wont talk about resident evil here because everyone knows about thattomb raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true d environment
sure you had games like doom and wolfenstien but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis
tomb raider allowed you to control lara the feminine version of indiana jones an use the environments such as cliffs roofs etc
to progress through the levels
level design in tomb raider is really what the game is centered around
beautiful stunning breathtaking eerie surreal all describe the level design here
nothing short of ingeniousthe game mechanics and control of lara were never the best but they were also adequate to get the job done
lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing
turning can sometimes be a chore especially when the action is turned up a notch
luckily the circle button makes lara do a somersault tumble for a quick quotaboutfacequot
the shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing
combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges and you are bound to fall in love with the action that eidos developed note this kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors including angel of darkness for ps
this kind of action became less and less as the series went on save for last revelation maybe
the swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as wellthere are plenty of surprises in this game that i dont want to give away however i will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long long time after
for example quotthe god roomquot of st francis folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that ive playedso why am i writing this review now  years after the release date
for a few reasons
first being that i cant get the game out of my head for more than a few months
every six months i go back to it
the second reason is that when i bought a ps i knew i would be playing the original tomb raider again and wanted that backward capability
and third and quite possibly the most important and the reason i titled this review quotdear eidosquot is that angel of darkness was the single reason that i sold my ps for an xbox
at first i enjoyed aod but the game has rampant problems
ive always welcomed a new tomb raider game in my life and gave aod more than one chance
i loved all the other ps tomb raider games including iii which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind but whatever
i hated aod and want eidos to know that
and fourth reason is that i repurchased the new and compact psone last week
i still own my tomb raider from back in the day
last night i played it and the magic was back like from the first time i played it
sure the graphics feel older but they are by no means bad at all considering that i play games like halo crimson skies prince of persia and rainbow six  on the xbox
there will always be a large place in my geeky videogaming heart for this true classiceidos take the power backoh yesthis game is what its all about
sure it looks totally archaic now with its primitive lowpolygon d cf
laras madonnastyle pyramid breasts and jerky low frame rate  but who cares
tomb raider was one of the first fullyrealized d games with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully  something nextgen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes  and of course best of all an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with
yes lara croft  men want her women want to be herlol
forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and worst of all the ps platform
even on the ps all the new innovations in graphics and ai that cropped up in subsequent tr installments couldnt improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut
the puzzles the secrets the attimes relentless action this game has it allmuch like indiana jones we first encounter lara as she explores some ruins in south america  allegedly the village of vilcabamba an actual archeological site in ecuador although as it appears in the game its more of a generic hotchpot of precolumbian art and architecture
of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere and of course she eventually finds a golden idol  more nods to indy
later she explores las vegas versions of rome and egypt slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet peta just loved this game before proceeding to  where else
 atlantis which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants
all this because shes in search of an artifact whose magical powers if in the wrong hands could destroy the world or somethingits easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot but that doesnt affect the entertainment value  again just like with indy you know its stupid but youre more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride
getting through the levels is not always easy youll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzlesolving skills
theres also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolicallyhidden secrets which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous medipaks
play this game  its almost like a cool retro thing to do now  and forget about everything that came after
they have a new tr in the works now but its got a lot of bad karma to overcomeso far nothing has matched this original masterpieceso this is where it all began  the original tomb raider
in november  britain was changing
with the phenomenal success of the spice girls and the phrase girl power there wasnt a better time to bring out an allfemale computer game heroine who kicked rear
enter lara croft
the game went straight to no all over the world and shifted more than  million copies to become the biggest selling playstation game of all time
lara soon became a cultural icon gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over  and not just computer magazines mainstream magazines such as rolling stone and time undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world
four sequels followed in the form of tomb raider ii tomb raider iii tomb raider iv the last revelation and tomb raider iv chronicles
the five games have sold a combined total of  million worldwide and secured eidos interactive and more importantly lara croft and tomb raider a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest most popular and enjoyable computer games of all timethe story of tomb raider is simple really
lara croft is a semifamous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman natla last name unknown to search the globe for an ancient artifact known as the scion that is beleived to have come from the lost city of atlantis
lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize
around halfway through the game while uncovering clues about the artifact in question lara also unveils the truth about natla a story told through amazing cutscenes
the storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more yet never for the game to endthe game begins with simple pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls
the enemies are only small in the first few levels bats dogs etc
that can be eliminated with a single shot of laras pistols  a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo
the game has a massive  levels that will keep you playing for months  it took me  months to complete
in fact i finished the week tomb raider ii came out so once id finished with the first i spent the next  months playing the second one
this has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five tomb raider games for around  years without a break
i remember the days when i bought this gamei was only  and it scared me to death
the enemies may not look very real but remember that controlling lara is
you control her every move so her life is in your hands
at the time the game was released the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking
the former is not so much now but the latter still stands
graphics in computer games have come a very long way since  but half an hours play on tomb raider with ms croft and its superior excellence shines through
the final levels are set in and around atlantis and are classic moments in video gaming history
from the rocky cliffs of asia to the hot muggy forests of south america and the haunting and eerie lost island of atlantis theres something here for everyone
buy it nowoverall grade all in all tomb raider is the ultimate playstation game
everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable
the atmosphere the sounds the animals make the noises lara makes when falling off a rock the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen  everything
this is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved  years ago
if you havent got tomb raider in your playstation games collection it is not complete
only when you purchase all  tomb raider games will your collection be complete
with the soontobe released lara croft timb raider vi the angel of darkness all six tomb raider will keep me playing for decades literally
i will still be playing tomb raider when im  years old and im sure ill not be the only onedespite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a game system and get used to it because that lasts until the ps era aka the sixth game in the series this has to be one of the funnest games of all time
it gives a challenge on multiple levels  inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre
was remade as tomb raider anniversary but id prefer the original any daylike ive said before tomb raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time
back in  the only competition in this genre was mario  nowadays every other game is a d adventure in the vain of tomb raiderthe game is very solid
well placed and thought provoking puzzles
some nice action great graphics which still hold up today and lots of fun
the only complaint is the lack of a decent ending and that i have to shoot a fellow human at least  times in order to kill him
how untrealistic is thatwhile tr  is the best in the series this one will be the most rememberedstory graphics sound fun god it was ages ago when i last played the original quottomb raiderquot
the first time i played it maybe six years ago i was amazed and frightened
i was frightened because of the very first level
you know the awry music dark caves and vicious bats wolves and bears
that will always be my first memory of playing quottomb raiderquot
even though its dated now it still lives up to its name despite several sequels and dissapointing movieswhat really made this game famous and made playstaion fun was the goddess lara croft
shes absolutely gorgeous
you play the adventrous archaeologist in a quest to recover an ancient artifact croft travels the world in style from peru to egypt and to the lost city of atlantisi think thats the story for the game
i lost track since i havent played this game for awhile
but what was original about this game wasnt really laras beauty it was the gameplay
the gamer has to solve complexed puzzles battle hard enemiesincluding dinosaurs
and go through hidden rooms and collect treasures from ancient citiesthere is also a good amount of weapons for lara including her trademark dual pistols
there is also some health packs in case she gets hurt in fact she gets hurt alot
no human being could ever do the things she does
the very physical lara jumps impossible feats does handstands and survives in very dangerous situations
shes a female indiana jonesanyway quottomb raiderquot is an entertaining game
it has good graphics solid gameplay and lara croft is hot
but the quottomb raiderquot series has lost track of its self
the gameplay is all ready becoming old and its lack of innovation hasnt made gamers happy
including myself
only part  is the best sequel
but the original game that made lara croft famous is a must own game for every classic game collectiontomb raider was one of the first games i completed and it was tough
really challenging throughout and educational one of the most intriguing and fun games to pass while shooting at random things and at dinosaurs and bears and other animals really greatits great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway
the levels are so cool its gets better each time you go to a new level
each level have something you must do before you go on
there are alot of little places that you can fine little small heath packs get those you will need it because there is always someone trying to stop you and kill you o if you fine anything useful get that toosometimes the informate is right there in your face you just got to look thats allthis was my only game that i own for my playstation
that the time i didt know if i sould play it or leave it alone will i play it and you know what i like it for once a woman is doing the thing and i said its about time do you know what i mean
well go have fun i did
take your time and do it right i did and i got good ative had tomb raider since july and this game is off the meters
when i first played it i was frustrated with the controls but once u learn them this game is the best
the worlds are long and puzzling but its never too hard to finish
the action and suspense make u feel like its a movie
i reccomend this to anybody who likes action or  fans like me
you will love it trust mei absolutely love tomb raider
it is definitely my favorite game of all time
it has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game
there is action and adventure thriller problem solving and an entertaining story line
i love the challenge of the problem solving
it isnt a game you can finish in a couple hours but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles
you definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game
it will always keep you thinking
i couldnt ask for a better gamei had to go back and play this game after playing and loving tomb raider anniversary
playing anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was
the level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore
i havent played the original since it first came out so i didnt realize just how much crystal dynamics took from this game
they took a lot
some of the level designs are almost identical
the biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty
anniversary is way easier
but not because the puzzles or enemies are easier
its because of the controls
back in tomb raider  the controls were pretty terrible
but what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of d
so ill over look it and give it a  out of i havent played tomb raider  in a long time but a month or so ago i found it at a used cd store and bought it
i just finished the game and am still thrilled at how exciting and tough this game still is
the plot is interesting enough for you to continue caring for the story and lara croft makes a fun character to use to get to your next destination
she is strong knows how to carry her weapons jump great heights and is truly fearless when it comes to dinosaurs bad guys and even messed up creatures she meets up with in the end
you have to constantly be kept on your toes throughout the game and the settings themselves are yes very old compared to nowadays improvements but for back then were well done and even nowadays not bad at least to me
this game is a fun challenge and i recommend it to anyone interested in adventure games for lara will take you on great journeys in this game
my favorite is where she is facing a sphinx like statue now that was a fun leveltomb raider is one of the greatest storylines ever created and that is why it is so popular even nowadays
the older stuff is better though aka like   of the tomb raider series is the best to me everything after  seems to have gone downhill
angel of darkness honestly i couldnt even finish it was so bad
so take my advice and try out the older version of tomb raiders first they are much better and more excitingthis is the best game i have yet to play
it took me six months to finally defeatfigure out and fight my way to the end of this game
this game was like a very suspenseful movie that i was controlling
many times in the game i was actually sweating from fear
you dont know whats waiting for you around each corner waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you
even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the  realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy cd soundsif you are a fan of tr youre gonna love to have this one in your collection
the graphics are better though on the pc versionthis takes back memories when i first played tomb raider
its both chalenging and fun
its remake is just added stuff and newly improved stagesi enjoy the shows and ppvs
this one is a great one to get if you like wwf wrestling use to play this as a kid and when i played it it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood
definitely a game to have if you are or were a fan of wrestlingi played this game a lot when i was little
it was always fun and i enjoyed it
the music in the background the colors the graphics its all great
the coolest thing is that this game is one of a kind and it is really a good one to add to any nintendo  collection
gameplay is easy and overall a really awesome gamei liked all of the tricks you can play being a kid
i like being a kid rather than an adult sometimes
the boards look coolif you like mario kart  then you will absolutely love this game
its sort of a rendition of mario kart  but instead of riding karts your riding snowboards
now in my biased opinion i love snowboarding games and this one was a classic among my friends and mei recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game
it had hilarious sound effects great controls a few varieties of boards to chose from and solid looking graphics
it is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead
whats really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run
to get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious
the only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from and theyre all little kids
in other games like mario kart there is more characters to chose from but the character choices are only a minor con
it also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids
but once you can read past its cover the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family
it is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives offoverall i rate this game a solid  out of  because it is fun and exciting and in my opinion better than mario kart tiberian sun is an example of how a real time game should be
great campains where you can be either nod or gdi
this game also has great skrimishes
where you can play the computer on a diffrent level of  difficulty and can play anwhere from  enimies
with alot of diffrent  units and buildings this game is not to be missedloved it
one of the best games in this genre
good story and even has the guy from the first terminator who protects the woman cant think of his name as one of the main actors in the cutscenes and james earl jones
high production values
the game play is top notchi am writing this review from what i thought of it before red alert  came out
this is a great game with a pretty good story line though it lacks graphics
westwood online the multiplayer sever is also very good
if your lookign to buy a good rts i recomend red alert  but if you dont want to spend the money on ra this is still a great gamewell it seems that those idiots who gave ts a low rating was because they  thought ts reused red alerts units
that is completely wrong 
ts is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units
red alert was a prequel to the  original campc and was set throughout the cold war
ts does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year ts took place which was  this is especially true with gdi and  there titans disruptors firestrom defense rpg towers mmk ii and a whole  lot more
nod has has the cyborgs underground units and and the banshee  aircraft etc
now are these the same units from ra i dont think so
westwood retained a couple of units from the original campc such as the  devils tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers
nothing from this game was copied from ra trust  me
as for starcraft some say its better than ts and some say it isnt
i  personally hate that game
its way more complex to understand than ts  simple interface no deformidable terrain you have to right click to  deselect units very awkward structures take extremely long to build  as  well as units those same structures look like they have legsterran  barracks and engineering bay
i also have no idea what the storyline is  about no real actors  jus  bad fmvsi could name a whole lot more but it  would take up too much space in this review
the only single thing i like  is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still  gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all rts games
sure starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people  just like the old campc some people ask for too much in a sequel and  when they find what they havent been looking for they disgrace the game
well see what sequel is in store for starcraft but for now if youre a  serious fan of campcs then pick up a copy of ts youll find an  intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time  favs that would have rememberedthis is this is the first strategy game i have ever liked that i played so maybe im partial to it  but i love it
i dont understand why some  people are so crushed when their quotfavoritequot game series puts out  a bad game
its not that big of a deal
for all you red alert buffs red  alert  will be out soon so chill out for a minute
there are a ton of  different strategies to play this game with so it becomes extremely  addictive
once you get the basics down  the sky is pretty much the  limit on strategies you can use so this adds replay value to the game
it  will definitely keep you busy until the next installment by westwood
the  online play is great and easy to use
i havent even played the single  player game because i just cant get enough of the online play
so unlike  the other people who are saying they hate it but they probably still play  it often i like it an awful loti just dont understand those who want to give this game low marks
this is a game that when modified with the numerous free online downloads is as good a game as any out thereto start this game is a sequel to command and conquer not red alert which is the much more popular westwood game
that was a problem for some who just assumed that westwood would come out with a red alert sequel first
never the less there are features in this game that improve upon the original
the original cnc did not allow for skirmish play against the al opponent only missions
this game does allow multiplayer play and the al is very  competitive at the more difficult levels
there are some other small extras as well such as more colors to choose from and the oppportunity to make a map right at the game menu
just set your specifications and it makes a map thats meets those specs
one new feature i love is the option for a deployable mcv
this allows you to start a base and then move your command center to another area
this game is also much more strategic then the originas cnc
the maps are spectacular with many cliffs ridges and rivers and lakes
no game has better maps and terrain
i wish i could say the same about the units though
while the structures are creative and attractive the units look down right bizarre and cartoonish
some may like this but i dont
the colors of the units and structures are rich and  pleasant but some units are too strange looking to enjoy
the infantry look alright but the tanks take some getting used to
another unfortunate aspect of the game is that the nod is given the more strategic interesting units
the gdi has more size and firpower while the nod is more sneaky with its burrowing apcs and missles
one feature i like is the infantryman
the disc throwers for the gdi or the rocket guys for the nod have armor that makes them much more competitive in battles than a rocket guy or grenade guy in red alert
you cant just run over these infantrymen
a group of  disc throwers can do serious damage to a camp if allowed to sneak in or they can quickly do away with a harvester
the basic play is bascially the same as cnc or red alert but there are enough new features here to make it a worthwhile purchase at overall i would rate the stock tiberian game that comes from the store as a  to  stars
a good solid game
what makes this a truly great game is the numerous free downloads and upgrades available both at westwoodcom and many other sites
on the program menu for the game is an upgrade option from westwood that helps to work out some of the bugs and improves the game
in addition there are literally dozens of websites devoted entirely or in part to this game that provides an incredible array of free downloads that provide game modifications new maps units and game tips ect
also included are opportunites to join klans and clubs things that really enhance the enjoyment of the game
one download called quotresistance quot will add  more speed and firepower and will double the number of units and structures
you can find this download at tsdencom
it is these additional modifications and options that convert a good game into a fantastic game
these upgrades and downloads are absolutely free and require very little time effort or computer savyness to add and if youre ambitious you can do your own modificationsthe only complaint i would have of my modified game is that there is no navy
all these wonderful maps with water but no opportunity to make destroyers or crusiers like in red alert or total annililationsocksfinal fantasy  is the best ff i have yet to play
i have played  and  also but  has the best music battle system and junctioning system of all of them not to mention the greatest storyline in the history of everything
besides a couple of translation errors this game is perfect
i was introduced to final fantasy   years ago and i still do not know many things about it
so if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it you should buy this game and before they stop selling iti have always been a ff fan ever since  was out
ive been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this
let me tell you about the gameas you have probably found out from other reviews it is about a rebel orginization named avalanche who is saving the planet from shinra inc who is polluting the earth
one of these members is a man named cloud a  year old guy who was in a orginazation called soldier which is the army of shinra
possibly the greatest plot and climax ive ever seen
great battles they proved to be a challenge
cloud sid and red  are my favorite charecters
also some of the best movies in a game that ive seen for a long time
espeically the  minute ending
man that was good
enjoyin this world nothing is as it seems
no one is who they say they are and surprises lurk around every corner
this is a wonderful game with a rich story great side quests and great animation
the evil shinra corporation has been mining mako an energy source that is the lifeforce of the earth itself
avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by barret a man whos arm was lost in an explosion at a mako refinery
cloud is a mercenary who used to work for soldier shinras private army
sephiroth is a great warrior for soldier who has been lost for many years
now cloud is working with avalanche and sephiroth has resurfaced but he is now an insane powerhungry man with a desire to use black materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world
materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user
this game has a great story and a great battle engine where you can customize  different characters with different materia
this is a long game but it is legendaryff  has always been my favorite game in the whole world in fact it is my whole world
i play it everyday but i was always sad because i had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss ff   but not anymore
now ff  is out on the pc and you have to buy it at any cost so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time the experience that is final fantasy  on your computer
just thinking about it is making me tear up a little
i promise you will not be disappointed
the stunning gutwrenching visuals the passionate heartwrenching storyline the exciting ballwrenching combat system the absolutely aweinspiring charactersnothing could be more perfect
you have not lived if you have not played this gamethis rpg is a blast to play
the graphics and battle system will blow you away when you first play it
theres even a tutorial so you can get in the game quicker
as for the storyline excellent
the storyline goes all over the place but thats what fun about it
the game itself is also long and entertaining
it took me  hours to finish sidequests and all
you even get an amusement park filled with games and wonderful items to help you on your quest
get this game
it will get you hoooked on hours to comeive never played the playstation version of this game and this was my  first time playing any sort of final fantasy game
i originally purchased  it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world  the characters and the dozens of things to doyou start off playing  cloud or whatever you decide to name him and are an exsoldier now  fighting for a group called avalanche who want to shut down a company  called shinra because theyre using mako energy to power the city
mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die
from there youre quickly plunged into a  story about love betrayal duty and saving the worldi easily got   hours of gameplay and the story blew me away
every time yu think you know  whats going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away
theres an even balance between combat and actual rpg where you talk to  folks in townsthis game also has great replayibility with dozens of  subquests and side games to keep you busy
can you raise a gold chocobo
can you defeat all three weapons
can you find all the megaelixers
can  you gain the secret characters
can you find everyones super technique  and ultimate weaponsthe story was amazingly detailed the characters  were all unique and the game pulled no punches
i highly reccomend itthis game is fantastic and you wont be able to put it down for a long long time
i have over  hours played on my game save
final fantasy vii platinum edition features a revamped old soundtrackthat i find x better than the psone versions soundtrack
although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls after playing for a while youll wonder how you would have done it any other way
the onscreen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship youll have a hard time typing in key combos
materia allows you to use different magics on different characters allowing for different characters to use summons magic and cure
my tip dont give up solely because of the controlsthis game is fantastic and although i found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into the pc version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it
ff is by far the best game i have ever played and you do not want to miss out on this adventure
my only tip dont save over the same file especially before you enter the northern crateryou wont be able to exit it if you doreplayability  tons of extra caves quests missions minigames to find extra materia weapons limitbreaks and bosses to fight well after the game is over
gameplay  amazing boss fights you will be on the edge of your seat during battles incredibly funstory  the plot twists the depth in the story the emotionsits amazinggraphics  you can view on a big resolution better textures and stuff
more crisp than the psone versioncontrols  takes a while to get used to you wont want to try another control setup once you dosound  sound effects are recycled from the psone game but the music was totally redone and that is one of the biggest parts of this gameaddictiveness  i stopped playing my other games for almost  months when i got into this gamethe best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play
the ruby and emerald weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game
raising chocobos and minigames at the golden saucer couldnt be more fun and this remains the only game besides world of warcraft that i havent uninstalled from my computer
final fantasy vii is a keeper and dont be discouraged by the prices on amazon by the time youre done with the game you will believe it to be the best  you have spent on a game
i would know because i said the same thingthis game is awesomebut see my playstation reveiw for resultsthis final fantasy  is one of the most influenced games of all time
the fan bases for this one game blows out all ff fan base out of the water
never has any other ff game seen such an influenced with multiple related gamesstory characters found in different games
multiple movies
toys cards etc based on this game
why was that all necessary for this one gameits just that damn awesome
this game has everything
story characters battle system music humor and more
if it didnt why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after
because it was just damn awesomeyou can play this game over and over before getting tried of it but you will keep it in your hearts forever
the amazing game play the amazing characters and amazing graphics
back in those days
they just cant make anything that even comes close to what they did back then
i wish they did but they cant
it was just too well done
lolill preface this by saying yes i have played through ffvii on the playstation when it first came out
ive probably played through it at least a dozen times as i just enjoy the story how it unfolds the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories togetherprior to this game i was mostly into sportsfps type games
an rpg heck i didnt even know what that meant at the time game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that i wanted
a friend of mine where i was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game
indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it the more i got interested in itthen came release day
i still wasnt sold on it but after leaving work i figured what the hell
drove  minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at ebgames
soon as i entered he was like did you preorder this
i told him no and that i wasnt really interested in rpgs as they always sound boring and id lose interest quick and waste my money
he showed me a quick demo and i admit it got me thinking as to i wonder what happens after this
i finally said sure
he hooked me up with the strategy guide free tshirt and the  disc game  discs
when i cracked open the case and saw  discs i knew this would be an epic legendary tale
i just didnt know how epici wont go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know whowhat they are
but the story wow
i could not have been more hooked
at first it started off a little slow mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going
after the nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet aeris it all changes
the direction tone and emotion starts running higher
battles get more intense
you really get the feel that something big much bigger than even all these characters is building up
it all seems to point to shinra but even as you infiltrate it something is even more disturbing
jenova
soon as i saw that short cutscene with cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber my jaw dropped
i wanted to know what it is where it came from what they are using it for etc etc etc
but thats what set this game apart
the more answers you get the more questions were raised than beforethe world is huge lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines
i spent alot of time raising the chocobos and racing them to get the gold choco so i can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materiamateria system one of the best magic systems i have encountered to date
while you wont use all the materia you buyfind
its the reward of seeing that glowing greenblueredyellowpurple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is
summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made
knights of the round was very long to summon but the damage and wait is well worth itcharacters some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds
i think the first time i really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when i first went into shinra mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the shinra research was stored regarding jenova sephiroth and the experiments
the characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations
making you want to keep going and see whats around the next cornerin conclusion for us longtimers here this game never gets old
for the newcomers get ready to experience something extraordinary
to quote the back of the playstation case what erupts goes beyond imagintionan interesting aspect of the final fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment
the first game was the ultimate experiment will this game succeed or will square go under
but each game was a stage in developmentff choosing party and character sprites in battlebefore that the dragon warrior games had battle headonffii wounddevelopable charactersromancing saga later employed this when you survive near death your hp goes up when you fight alot attack goes up etc
ffj simple job system completely changes characters no permanent skillsff changing characters a dark knight becomes a paladinffv advanced job system level up with one of the noncommand skills to default class and you permanently learn it for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief and then deequip itffvi basic gf system mainly just boosts skillsff basic weapon systemff gf systemff i heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic never bought the gamelikewise the plot in each was experimental
they fiddled around with the crystal concept in ff ffj ff ffv
they had ruthless kings dark overlords and the occasional malicious squid
but the most intense game i have played so far was final fantasy  why
well when halfway through the game your character doesnt even know who he is anymore it is pretty interesting
not to mention you have combos to build chocobos to raise and race never was good at this and some pretty weird items to collect i mean honestly what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wearwords really can describe how wonderful this game is
the first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics note a d card is not required
everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions
the story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics it makes this a very absorbing adventure
this is one of the few games that i cant say anything negative about
this is a must havegrim fandango will definitally be enjoyed by fans of film noir and mexican mythology
id give it a  and a half if i could
the graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements
some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing
you follow the character manny calavera a travel agent for the dead guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible
for some reason manny is denied any premium clients
whos behind all this
find out over a  year journey from the dusty streets of el marrow to the edge of the world and back again
absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noirish music immerse you in the atmosphere
clever interface and variable controls are great
a very involving game
not too long not too short
humor and wit are weaved through every scene
in conclusion film noir style surreal visuals toe tapping and ensuing music gripping story charming characters and challenging puzzles will intrigue all game fansi had problems with it at first  crashing but then i installed the patch that i downloaded and it worked great
the game did remind me a lot of the monkey island series
although monkey island id say had the best music
grim had ok music
game was funny and at the end i wanted more i finished it too fast i shouldnt have used those cheats
really recommended i wish there was a part iithis was truly one of the best games i have played in a long time
it has challenging puzzles that may at times seem impossible but the solution is often right before your eyes
based upon the mexican day of the dead it  gives the player a little bit of background while keeping them entertained
great game lots of pi
cliches mentally stimulating and just plain funnot a whole lot to say except that as far as adventure games go this is  the standard that all others should try to exceedoutstanding voice  acting and scripting
hilarious game without making fun of itself
tough  but logical puzzles that will have you scratching your head
beautiful and  original storyline movie material right herethis is what adventure  gaming was fated fori was very dubious when i started playing grim fandango
an adventure game with polygons
and the scumm menu interface system that was in every single past lucasarts adventure game was gone
but i gave it a try
thank  goodness i didgrim fandango is a story about manny calavera a travel  agent for the souls of the dead
he sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip somedayimagine the theme of  casablanca with some mexican folklore and mayan art thrown in for fun
add  big orange demons hot rods killer beavers cat races and the grim reaper  and you have grim fandangothe story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch
its very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story but  somehow this game pulls it off
grim fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut anotherthe things  that make a good adventure game are all there
logical puzzles that dont  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them good  acting good animation and good code
if i were ever forced to reccomend  only on adventure game to someone this would be itthis is without a doubt one of the best games ever made  adventure or otherwise
it is fun amusing original colorful and challenging without being annoying
the only games that came close to it may be the monkey island series or the last express
the game is beautifully designed with unforgettable characters amazing landscapes and reminds me of being inside a really wellwritten movie
sadly lucasarts stopped making games like this a loss for the worldif they made more games like this id be a pauper
intelligent funny easy to use easy to solve and no bloody chess problems
its also thoughtprovoking gorgeous wellwritten and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it
one of my favorites that i play over and over again
one caveat at least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed so if you have a fast machine youll need to download a patch from the manufacturers website
well worth the trouble thoughthis is the epitome of graphic adventures
no other game has even come close to grim fantango when it comes to humor of all shades and shapes inventiveness delicious irony creative graphics and plain goodol fun
this is a year old game mind you  yet it retains its freshness as any true work of art
this is how computer games should have been  and not the pathetic cookiecutter products of megacorporations working intandem with gxcard companiesyour character hilarious and lovable manny calavera is alreadydead when you start
in fact he has been dead for some time stuck in limbo trying to pay his way to a better afterlife by selling tickets to other souls on their way to paradise
guess what corruption is not limited just to this world
and where there is corruption there is oppression and where there is oppression there is always a revolution brewingrealizing he is being duped manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the most beautiful game ever produced
immersing noirish atmosphere detailed artdeco settings fast bogartian dialogs  with a subtle ironic frostingwarning there are known problems with todays faster processors
so unless you have a really old system running win you will need the winxp patch otherwise you will not get past the crane scenewith the highest recommendationsi still remember when i first bought this game in the s and i still playthe game from time to time for both entertainment and nostalgia
as with most of the pc games in the s there was no type commands but just the point and click with the mouse usually but still the humor and video cut scenes in the game were more than enough to keep you playing until the end
the short storyplot was your character was a civil servant for the spiritual plane where the recently departed had to stop before making their final passage to eternal rest
your character for whatever reason had to work off a certain amount of time to clear his debt before going to the place of eternal rest as well
the job was you worked to see how well the person who just died was in life meaning the more compassionate and humane they were in life the faster to paradise they would get to meaning the usual ways to get to paradise depending on the person was bus boat car and if very high on the morality meter the number nine train which would only take nine minutes for the person to get to paradise
of course there was more to the game and that is why it made it very entertaining to play
the video graphics are of the s era so again if your used to playing recent pc games you might feel the graphics are sub par but dont let that dissuade you from this game
the voice actors they got to do the characters were incredible both in their acting for their characters and their ability to bring the humor and excitement into the game itself
i know while some think this doesnt have the fighting or the action of recent pc games but i still feel that its one of the few classics that many people will still find very enjoyable to play both for themselves and children without worrying about to much violence of the gameif you liked full trottle and love lucasarts games in general youll love this game
its one of the funniest games ive ever played
the way all the charters talk hispanic is enough to me laugh out loud
manny  calavera is the most likeable anithero youll ever have the pleasure to  control in this fantastic land of the dead adventure game
who said the  adventure games was dead
grim fandango proofs them all wrongi dont go for adventure games personally
ninety percent of the time i prefer shooters
but this oneman its so weird so unique and so genius through and through how can you not love itheres the story
manny calavera is a lowlevel salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent days pay but it never seems to work out for him
his boss is constantly on his back hes routinely snaked by a competitor domino hurley and the right sales never come his way
its a lousy life to haveespecially if youre already deadthats the twist manny and just about everyone else in the game is dead
this whole game takes place in the land of the dead of mexicanaztec folklore with a strong art deco influence with heavy doses of s crime noir thrown in
everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in day of the dead festivals called calaveras get it
manny works in the department of death trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive
he does that by trying to sell travel packages to the recently deceased so they can make their fouryear journey across the land of the dead until they reach the portal leading to the land of eternal rest
the quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car a luxury liner or the exclusive no
 train which speeds its passengers there in four minutes instead of the customary four yearsunfortunately the kind of lowlifes who keep coming mannys way only deserve walking sticks at best which does absolutely nothing to help manny work off his time
so he decides to take matters into his own hands and steal the right kind of clientand thats when he gets in over his headthe story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist like raymond chandler meets tim burton
the plot manny uncovers is convoluted brilliant deeply twisted and diabolical like youve never imagined possible
its also incredibly unspeakably funny
tim schaefer is one absurd individual make no mistakeyes its an old game i know
but the true classics know no age and this is a classic all right
so take advantage of the price snap it up and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent
hes waiting for yougrim fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion
the plot the comedy the political intrigues an occasional romance  all right here
one of the things i found most amusing was whenever manny the main character  manages to build his life or is it death
up again you the player  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day
whew think i got enough  parenthesis in
if you enjoy an easygoing adventure game with a great  story to tell this games for youpossibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games grim fandango has a charm which is all in the execution
this is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed
blending the tradition of mexican folklore with the suave of sixties beat  culture and the style of the big combo fandango is a sensory  explosion
somewhat courageously it does not attempt to make its  graphics realistic
rather it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect
like the best films fandango manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself
its firstrate direction and hitherto  uniquetoadventuregames d technology  points the way forward for the  adventure gamestrue some of the puzzles are hard but none of them  really seem out of place
indeed there is with grim fandango a true  sense of plot
maybe the characters dont develop as they do in novels or  great films but thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing they do  maintain charming integrity throughoutif i have a complaint with the  game it is the interface by which your character manny communicates with  others
you choose from among several sentence options like those old  quotchooseanendingquot books
its not a bad way to play a game i  suppose but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the games cast
as a  result solving problems is sometimes dead simple
of course there arent  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like titanic with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player might be more fully realizedsome people though might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly
it does speed game  play and isnt as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be
this is a big game with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet
speedofplay matters
so even if i personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters i can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  availablethus even if you think you dont like adventure games you  should still buy grim fandango
likewise if you dont have time to play  adventure games you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end because the graphics story and soundtrack are just that good
this  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be headingeven though this game is almost  years old and uses a modified quake engine it is still one of the most fun and best shooters ever to be made
in fact all other first person shooters and games in general can learn from half life  the game world is extremely immersive
there are no level ends there is no text to read there are no scores and everyone talks to you without freezing you into a cut scene
all of this makes you feel less like you are a player playing a game but you are indeed the hero gordon freeman
characters recognize you talk to you and you can have them come with you or stay put
security guards that come with you will shoot enemies slowlythe story is that you are silent protagonist gordon freeman youll feel like him by the end and you work for black mesa your standard super secret facility
something goes horribly wrong and uh
the formula is very simple but they execute it so well that other games have copied it and failed doom 
needless to say you need to fight your way out through the facility on the desert being chased by a helicopter and everything else would just be a spoiler
there are no levels no loading screens
loading is seamless and happens during downtimehalf life  has simple controls and an optional tutorial level
there are buttons for jumping crouching sneaking using your flashlight that needs to be off to charge it shooting secondary shooting for machine guns and using things
the game is always in run mode and character speed seems to be fast
too fast sometimes but there is that sneak button that will slow you downbut how is the first person shooting
there is a wide variety of guns and each has a certain joy and usefulness to them
even the simple pistol is useful for lesser enemies  hours into the game
there is a shotgun a machine gun with grenade launcher grenades explosives you detonate wall sensors with explosives a harpoon a laser guided rocket launcher that once it launches you point your cursor and it will turn accordingly lasers homing missiles head crabs and more
an amazing array that you continue to get even up to the final levels areas
to swap weapons you push  number keys and press some keys twice to access some weapons like the shotgun  machine gun  harpoonyou start with a crowbar good for breaking grates and destroying boxes
destroying boxes is how you will find most items and ammo
instead of just finding things scattered on the floor on shelves or on a desk you need to bash open boxes to find the good stuff
you can also push or pull the boxes too which is nice for puzzle solving and platformingthe enemies are just as diverse and each one requires you to think and act differently
since i dont know the name of any enemy ill fumble through this
the start enemies are lesser creatures that will start on the floor and jump at you
 shots from a pistol take them out
there are zombieish aliens that take a shotgun or two but they are easy enough to avoid
aliens that teleport in and beam electricity at you will cause you to hide pudgy little alien crawler  hoppers will make you shoot from a distance because they will send out a small shockwave
standard soldiers that will shoot machine guns throw grenades and coordinate attacks against you like flanking
ceiling huggers that are yucky red globs on the ceiling with long rope like tongues that when they catch you youll be pulled up and eaten if you dont shoot them
giant aliens with homing missiles too
there is a wide variety of enemies and bosses
i cant list them allthe game also shines with its tricks and traps and will throw a puzzle or challenge at you to keep you thinking
but in this game it doesnt feel like a puzzle or a challenge
it seems natural
there can be a hidden turret where the fun is making your choice how to take it out grenade explosive shooting it and getting shot in the process running by it or just not hitting the trip wire to start it in general
wall sensor explosives push and pull box puzzles pushing buttons hopping hanging boxes over a pit conveyer belts using a sky cannon to destroy walls using turrets on rails vehicles that you have a lot of control over water puzzles high jump pads and so on
there is a lot of variety and its never the same thing twiceto sum it up this is a diverse and very fun game
it has a sense of humor to it and youll feel like you are gordon freeman through the games well crafted immersion
puzzles shooting and challenges all melded together into one fantastic game and i cant say that too ofteni was never a big fan of the firstperson shooter fps genre but after giving halflife a try thanks to all of the glimmering reviews i am absolutely hooked
from the opening tram sequence youre mesmerized by  gordon freemans plight and the falling black mesa world surrounding him
its a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of  sunlight apologies to my wife
after dishing out punishment to those  marines be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes
the fun gets even better and the taste of death is even sweeter when you  blow apart that guy with  kills
halflife is truly a work of art
opposing forces here i comei bought the original when it first came out in  in late  valve rereleased halflife with the update source engine used in halflife  there is no new content though
i decided to play source to coincide with the th anniversary of this amazing game
source just has more realistic water a better physics engine ragdolls some better lighting effects cleaner mapping and new d skybox
i am happy i have played source but the differences between this and the original may not be enough to justify the costs
the differences are not really noticeable
so if you want to play halflife just know that there are two versions of the game out there
halflife standard and halflife sourcenow to the story so far in the beginning there was nothing new much in the halflife game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the quake game engine so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time
when halflife first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do story story and story
valve created halflife in a period of our lives when area  was a hot topic among ufo buffs and the xfiles was to become mainstream family television viewing
alien based entertainment media was a craze in the mid and late s unprecedented since the s
smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for ufo enthusiasts came halflife where you get to play as gordon freeman a physics researcher who witnesses a freak accident in an area  type facility
all hell breaks loose and you have to survive
no cut scenes
no initial story
no explanation
you where just there and you had to escape
cue interactive characters that could follow you around and say a few things maps rich in objects that you could break eventually leading up to rapid action shootouts with monsters and marinesplaying hl again was simply reliving that experience all over
yes games have improved but this offering still destroys a lot of the competition
valve just did it right and there is no reason not to want to load this up and give it a whirl again
lets face it this is gaming history
halflife changed the fps scene in ways other games have since tried but failed
has there ever been a revolution in fps quite like halflife
some may have come close but not nearly as far
that is how important this game ishalf life revolutionized pc gaming
it is one of the greatest if not the best pc game ever made
it has bin said that from almost every pc mag or game mag
i was a few to own this masterpiece when it first hit stores and all i can say iswowthis game really changed about the fps gaming
it just made me think different about fps
it truly is a masterpiece
i wont spoil this games amazing story of the g mans adventure
i wont even say how good this game is you just have to play it for your selfthe graphics for that time was amazing and so will the upcoming half life  baby
nuff saidthe gameplayyoure a moron if you acctually think im gonna go into that since we already no how incredible the game isnuff saidthe story is what makes this gamea gameits not just any shooterits history in the makingwell for games atleastim just gonna make this short and sweet for youthis game is amazingof course this deserves a out of  stars
amazingjust amazingnuff said get the game before hl comes outlatesmade in  but still better quality play and design than most games on the market in 
good storyline great ai and graphics notoverly aggressive system requirments tons of addons available
incredible single player mode good weapon selection and arguably one of the best fps online games of all time
if you like halo you will like halflife
very similar but no limit on how many weapons you can carry and the levels arent as repetative
my biggest complaint about halo though its obvious why many of the levels and hallways are exact copies of one youve seen dozens of times alreadygives a feeling of being lost and even fed up at times
halo does have the edge as far as cars and what not though
i also recommend halflife  the sequel to what im talkin about here  insane graphics and gameplayposibly the best game i ever played this game is great u may think u should just rent it but dontthis game is so long it took me bout  months to pass itthere is a great storylinei played all of hl games and this is the best onefor example in half life  u get to a radio and a soldier says there to retreat
if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voicegreat story line great wepons great multiplayertrust me ull never get tired of this gameget the gameps
 you wont regret thisi usually turned off all lights and played game in deep night after a wholeday work even on bloody quake i or doom ii it is ok and i was for a long time a quake ii fan esp
in single player mode
with numerous addon levels distributed on the web i thought the dshooter game has  reached the limit in quake ii
but alas what a game the halflife is
i  dare not played it in the deep night alone with all lights off
with a very  good storyline and excellent atmosphere the game is horrible
you never  know what the next step will be
the monsters are not stupidly standing  there waiting for your bullets instead they are chasing and hunting you
it is simply the best single player d shoot game so fargreat game
old now of course but still fun to play
good gameplay and pretty good graphics not the best but good
fun shooter
the halflife series is really successful and this is the game that started it
you dont have to have a great computer to play this game and thats the plus of it
i never beat this game but got close to it i just got stuck lol
if you are new to the halflife series then this is the game to get
check it outi was feeling nostalgic last week so i started playing unreal again
probably for my third time through at this point
while unreal doesnt have as much replay value as a game like half life it certainly does have its moments
unreal was one of those really impressive fps games for its time
it boasted great graphics and intense game play
of course by s standards these graphics merely look silly
but if you were picking this up in  like i was you were pretty impressedi figure ill throw in some points about playing this on a more current system since i experienced some issues here and there
being a game made for windows  it doesnt translate perfectly over to an xp  bit system
i have no idea what this would do on vistas  bit architecture
basically when reinstalling it i got a strange error with the option to ignore
you can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine
strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that ignore message comes up as well
im not sure if this is just my system but i recommend saving quite frequently at least every time you hit a load screen
for some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you
this can be frustrating if youve been playing for a while because it doesnt auto save between load screens
otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system
you can also get the unreal anthology which has been updated to handle windows xp
oh and this was on a pentium   ghz systemthat being said ill move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time
the first thing you notice is that you have almost no health
you begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner
naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship
the ship is kind of a boring part of the level but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet
when you finally get out of the ship the first thing youll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you
outside its very bright and vibrant in spots
this felt a little different compared to games like quake half life doom because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them
unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery
one thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge
this was really impressive and fun when you first got into itas you explore and interact with the world you learn more about whats going on with this planet called na pali
apparently the native people are called the nali and theyve been enslaved by an alien race called the skaarj
the nali are extreme pacifists and i cant help but think their designers wanted them to be buddhists for the most part
the skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game though not the only enemy creatures youll face
they are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit
youll notice that the skaarj design is clearly influenced by predator
they have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a predator
to brandish even more similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms
as you can see this isnt very original
another part that is kind of unoriginalstrange is the nali castles that you come across
they are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the skaarj who have high grade technology
strangely you come across large castles that look like theyre straight out of thirteenth century england
i know strange for a race of pacifists
despite all this those parts are some of the most fun to play through
i loved going into the castles and running aroundanother aspect that made unreal very special when compared to other fps games was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game
it truly does feel like youre on an alien world
the sounds the textures were all there perfectly bringing you into this world almost so much that you didnt want to leave
you even hear echoes off of cliffs if youre walking through a cavern its like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user
for its time the unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world
they also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted
so when im fighting against the skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots
this was really cool to see and i really only found that in games like half lifethe maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times
i really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game marathon
a lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers or whatever in order to proceed onto the next section
this game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of  to  hours to complete so you really get your moneys worth
the downfall to having such large maps is its kind of easy to get lost sometimes if youre trying to complete certain tasks
another detriment to the game was the lighting
i put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where i was going
sometimes that wasnt even bright enough
there are sections of this game that are absolutely dark especially towards the end of the game
while this creates a very scary atmosphere i felt it hindered the game play once in a while
the reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with
you have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas
now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes
seriously the flashlights in real life would not die so quickly and then its up to you to go find another one
the only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light you cant enjoy the environment nearly as muchaside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and i had a lot of fun playing it
in  this came out around the same time as half life and they were both the must play fps games that year
half life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line
unfortunately unreals story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things
the user doesnt really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles
whereas half life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control
unreal just couldnt compete with something of that caliber and its not nearly as engrossing on that level
beautiful world and really fun to play overall but not the best of the yearoverall rating  out of this game is fun to play just for looking at all of the scenery
i enjoy all the brilliant colors and the array of monsters to kill
this is a quaketype game but is better in everyway except the weapons
just plain  funreally enjoyed this classic fps
hardcore gamers wont be disappointed
i highly recommend purchasing
graphics are great storyline is solid and not so short  audio is excellent and the price is rightthe game may be old but its still fun as hell
the scenery and graphics are really not that bad at all
quite a change from traditional fps games which is definitely a good thingwhen the day i got unreal and tried it i loved it so much i started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be calledthe prison shipvortexrikers
but when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of napali then all goes wrongyour best friend gets eaten by a skaarj you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel you reach outside grounds and say this cant be real no its not its unrealunreal takes you through  heart beating breath taking missions where you fight for life to survive collecting itemslike defenses and weapons travel through temples facilitys castles bases mountians journey through what napali has to offer and end up and the skaarj mothers ship confronting the queen skaarjunaided and alonei would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person scifi fan shootersthis game is so incrediblethe graphics the sound quality the digital music the gameplay the ai everything about itwhen i first stepped outside of the prison ship using opengl supportusing d hardware rendering on your d video card along with dhardware support sound quality at maxium and using a pentium  tnt d video card  sdram and  mb of harddrive space it ran incredible it was unrealbut ive been hearing about why dfx support from voodoo video cards looks so incredible ive been wondering that its more incredible that opengl or directd supportstill this game kicks behind
buy it
only  dollars today stop by at eletronics boutique and buy this game
i reccomend at least a shiny new pentium two a whole lot of memory for a example mb of sdram gs of harddrive space and a powerful d sound card and a d video card with lots of ram on itas a fan of myst and riven i would not put this game in the same  category
however it does equally well for its type
myst and riven  dont have a main character that you are per se whereas in this game you  have a name and a facethe game puts you in the shoes of one agent craig  wilmore
he is put on a case to find the missing xfiles staff agents fox  mulder and dana scully
as an xfiles fan i found this game very  entertaining
as a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games
there were hints stuff to pick up things to do etc
this was well  within the capabilities of nonx filers and should be equally entertainingi likened this game to the gabriel knight  the beast within and  phantasmagoria
unlike phantasmagoria there were no gory scenes of which  i was thankful
the people were movies of real people and not cartoons
the dialgue though limited offered enough variability
one important point  would be to save often
i got killed alotthe game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next
that is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick upall in all a good buy
whens the next onethe game in many ways is like tony hawk
in fact the only differnt thing this snowboarding
the graphic and gameplay are good
with  differnt boarders to use and alot of tracks the game is worth the moneyim  now got the game when it first came out when i was around  still the bet snowboarding game of all time
so much fun that i still get the n out here and there simply to play this game
has a time attack mode trick mode racing series and a mixture of them all
just a great classic that rates up their with  goldeneye for classic n games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself
great gamethats highly reccomendedwhen my cousin first got this on his birthday i was thinking quot this is just gonna be like all the other snowboarding games ive playedquot
man was i wrong
with  levels of exciting heart stopping jump twists and turns this is one game you dont wanna miss
it has all the best modes match raceltthis is where you earn hidden levels against the computergt  player trick attack time attackand contest this is one game that wont get tiring fast
heed this warningif you buy this game dont go after the  just yet its hard to master
what more do i have to say
buy this gameonce you get the hang of the controls this game is awesome its challenging and entertaining and everyone should have onethis game has amazing graphics you can even see the snow spray off the board when you make the slightest turn
plus the camera controls are flawless
the sound track is pretty good too you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool toomy only complaint is that there arent enough courses
after i unlocked the  courses and beat the quotblack diamondquot level there wasnt much else to do
but even after youve unlocked all the courses its still fun to play against your friends in the  person vs mode or doing tricks in the half pipei think that anyone who has a n should add this game to their collection without a doubt its a solid game and you wont regret itwithout any doubt  snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game availablethe difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master but its well worth it
landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normalthe mode and track selection is very nice offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes
the tracks offer beautiful scenery sometimes very big jumps jumping over cars and a lot morethe tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable
although you cant go beyond  degree turns there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game also includes a training mode which includes two different sections the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls
when you begin you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over
when you finish you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit also has a few secret riders and boards within the gameoverall  is probably the best snowboarding game around without any doubt
would be definitely worth buyingi love the nintendo 
i still play some games occasionally and this one was always a fun one
it will frustrate you thoughi was actually thinking about this game a few months ago and it was killing me that i couldnt remember the name
this game was a ton of fun though im sure if i played it now i would laugh at how dated it is
if you have a way to play this i recommend it
i blew a lot of hours on this game and would gladly pick it up again if they made it available for download on the psfans of any oldschool dungeon crawler should snap this game up
in a similar style to other games of the time you assume the roll of a monster hunter with a mission to climb a mysterious tower following in your fathers footstepssome may say the graphics are dated
i feel that they are nostalgic
with randomlygenerated dungeons spelunking is always a grand adventure
a musthave for any rpg lover out of  people will probably see this and pass it up as another cheap rpg for one thing you only have  dungeon gasp when you leve you level back down to  gasp and you capture monster just like in pokemon gasp
no its not a compelation of rip offs this is a classic that is highly addicting and incredibly fun if given a chancethe story revolves around a young lad you name who on his fifteenth birthday is given the opportunity to become a hunter and explore the depths of the monster tower to retrieve riches however to do so he must not only survive but grow as a trainer and as a man
in comes the kewe the monster you will likely use for a majority of the game
he is a fire type there are only three types and he is your brief tutorial and key to success early on you also must build up your respect to the townsfolk to do this you must enlarge certain places temple hospital and build new things library gym casino race track bowling alley ect and the town will grow to respect younow as for the tower itself there are  floors everytime you leave you go back down to level   no its not immpossible for two reasonsa your monsters level stays the same when you leave this is due to the fact that they are more like equipmentb weapons and armors stay the same when a red or blue sand is used your weapons and armor grow more powerful so technically you can easily dominate the first few levels without you monsters assistanceoverall this game is tricky you will die the first few times lose all your items except monsters  but once they are strong enough you can succeed
there are  randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along
you must adjust your mosnters accordingly by classafirebwindcwaterfire beats wind water beats fire wind beats wateri would buy this for the challenge it possess guarennteed addictionthis is most likely one of the best n games ever made its way better then super mario  in everyway and possibly zelda too its rich colorful and very addicting the soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive you just cant stop listening to it
 and the world designs  total i believe are all very beautiful and gorgeous ive beaten the game to  and i still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement its just really cool this game is a must have for any nintendo  player im serious if you dont have this your missing out big timeps
check out its sequel banjotooie after youve bought thisrare just has an extraordinary knack at making great games
banjo kazooie was released in  and has been considered a classic since and i too must agree with this well deserved honor
well why do i find this game fantastic
well ill explain that in my reviewfirst off lets talk about banjo kazooies story
banjos sister tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch gruntilda
gruntilda has planned on swapping tootys beauty to her but not if banjo and his friend kazooie can help it
okay seriously this story is pretty lame but hey
its a game
in my opinion no matter how good the graphics are or how great the story is it all boils down to one thing
and thats gameplay
and banjo kazooie has fantastic gameplayin banjo kazooie you play as banjo andwellkazooie and kazooie stays inside banjos backpack at all times but shes not useless
they both work as a team and learn many moves which brings us to our next character bottles
bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat gruntilda and rescue tooty
but do you just walk up to gruntilda and save tooty
not at all there are several items to collect to defeat gruntilda
the most important one is jiggies there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them
along the way bottles teaches you to use certain items such as eggs to shoot through kazooies mouth or how to fly when you collect enough feathers
another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens
gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman mumbo jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey
so you have plenty to do in this game i can guarantee that
another essential item are music notes in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in gruntildas massive lair
but i do find it to become quite tedious sometimes
why
you may ask
because each time you leave and reenter a world all the notes are still there no matter how many youve collected
lets say youve collected ninetynine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect well if you leave the world and reenter you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again you couldnt go searching for the one music note you hadnt collected
and while yet this situation is highly unlikely its still annoying no matter how many notes you have to recollect
fortunately if you dont care about collecting all one hundred music notes you dont have to because the game automatically saves the amount youve collectedthere arent too many moves to learn in banjo kazooie and it didnt take me long to master them
and there arent many control problems actually the controls are almost perfect
but i did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game i wish banjo could hang on to ledges there was many times in clankers cavern where i could almost reach a ledge  but it was just barely out of reach because i couldnt hang on to the ledge
while yet this wasnt too big of a deal i think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating
i was also very pleased with camera control there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and i found it easy to maneuveri told you this game was made in  right
well the graphics are terrific
the different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable
you can relax in broad daylight in treasure trove cove or wonder at dark in mad monster mansion
and i thought the last world click clock wood was absolutely brilliant its a forest and you collect jiggies in the four seasons spring summer fall and winter
i especially loved freezeezy peak and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowmani also loved the music in this game each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me and the sound effects were great as wellwell the only complaint i could have is that there is no dialogue in the game but i actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and i loved the insults between kazooie and bottles and gruntildas rhymes cracked me up thats another reason i love this game it has such a charm to it not like some newer games to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming and this game has this qualitywhat more can i say
this game is fun to play it has great replay value the music sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well
it took me thirty hours to complete without a guide and i had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times
i will admit i did need help online for a few jiggies but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile very satisfying if you ask me
im now very anxious to play banjo tooie as its been claimed to be even better than the original
banjo kazooie is highly recommended this game is indeed a classicgreat gameif mario  was good than banjo was mario perfectedamazing gameanother gem from years ago that i played start to finish multiple timesamazing levelsperfect controlgreat but hokey musicsome people were annoyed by the voicesi thought they were hilariousthe camera does get a little crazy here and there but this was d platforming in its beginning and really the camera is about as perfect as a d platforming camera can beto summarizegreat gameplayawesome graphics for the timean ending riddle that had me looking for a way in for weeks on end
a real bummer that the two games didnt link after allthats probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the notherwiseanother great platformer from the golden age of platforming collect a thonshighly recommendedthis is one game that will test your skills on how to figure things out but if you want to take the easy way out you can always get bottles the neer sighted moles help
one thing i like about this game is that when bottle  kazooie confront each other they always throw smack at each other which makes the storyline more funnier
this is a pretty cool game its worth buying
i had fun playing it i will buy itif you liked this game check out all of the other banjo  kazooie gamesone of the best games on the n it combines action adventure puzzle and other elements as you go through awsome based levels to beat itgoldeneye  killer instint the donkey kong country series conker diddy kong racingthose were the good ol days when rare was still relevant
before they sold their souls to microsoft and lost all credibility
and in my opinion the peak of rare was with the banjo games kazooie  tooie on nintendo   kazooie to me defines the n d platformer
while many will say mario  which is a near perfect game
i think the nostalgia sometimes forgets how much better banjo kazooie was
back in  rare was on a roll
this game was yet another grandslam
a brand new franchise cut from scratch
and its absolutely amazing
i wont go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear
all i can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late s
it was a game i picked up and loved immediately
my only question is what the  happened to rare
they were so amazing with nintendo then dropped bomb after bomb for the xbox consoles
im not a nintendo fanboy so dont even go there
but rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on microsoft consoles
the  game will always be the best
and i hope someday the brothers who originally ran rare will comeback to bring the infamous banjo threeie to life on any consolepositive gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content music tracks are great and change in style when youre in different spots sharp controls that work well for the most partnegative you have to start your note count every time you reenter a world camera doesnt always give you the best view you needsuper mario  revolutionized the d platformer and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence
but when a revolution comes whats the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on
in video games a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level and possibly delivering a game thats even better than the root
whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved mario  or rare is just really really good at making games that is where we find banjokazooiegames of the platforming genre arent exactly known for their amazing stories and banjo fares no different
banjos little sister tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch gruntilda
she has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer tootys beauty to herself and this will leave banjos poor sister ugly in the process
so banjo and his grumpy bird friend kazooie who for some reason lives in banjos backpack set out to gruntildas lair to save tooty
the story doesnt take itself very seriously at all but theres a great humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depththe game doesnt move from place to place at all the whole thing takes place in gruntildas huge lair key word being huge
this one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game
there is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair with a sewer swamp graveyard and many other spots
the areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the games nine worlds which are all big diverse and have a lot of stuff to find
youll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game then moving on to a beach and later a snow area and haunted mansionlike world and so on
the game never really runs out of new material to throw at you which is really nice even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre tooanother way banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn
in most of the levels you can find a mole named bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him
these moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically
you have to unlock some of these abilities such as flight and invincibility to get deeper into gruntildas lair and also to accomplish more in the worlds
the game controls very well too even with all the added moves and it doesnt get too complicated
one issue though is with the camera which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes cant get the viewpoint thats just right for a room or areabut the core of the game stays the same no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit
the main objects to collect are jiggies which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that when put together open the door to a new world
ten of these can be found in each level along with  notes which open up doors to new areas of the lair
unfortunately the games note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level each time you reenter a world the note count restarts
this is pretty annoying sometimes and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you dont have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count
thankfully the jiggies are extremely wellbalanced as far as how hard they are to get in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like easter eggs but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worldsgraphically banjo kept up to date well enough
the visuals are just a tad choppy but they still look good enough and that sort of thing happened all the time in the n era
sometimes objects that are a little ways away wont appear on screen until you get closer which thankfully doesnt prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed
despite these few flaws though the graphics look great considering the timesone of banjos shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound
the characters speak in a gibberish sort of language with text shown on the bottom of the screen and this might annoy some but its still good to add personality to each character
the sound effects are all good too no complaints there
the really cool part of the sound though is the music
the tracks are cool enough as they are but when youre standing on a different spot or in a different area like if youre under water or at the entrance to a different world the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song
then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when i say its really really coolmario  may have been the revolution but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better in my opinion
banjokazooie is one such game adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula
it may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the gamemaking world but banjokazooie is a real gem from rares glory days on the n and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years oldgameplay graphics sound camera  control value final score all in all this is the best platform game that i have played in a long time
of course it follows the basic formula of a platformer  kidnapped female evil castle jump on enemies etc
but the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that occasionally it works really well
banjokazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection
although we question nintendos blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president they did so for a good cause and a damn good gamelike super mario and donkey kong this game is a classic
the good gameplay and graphics pay off
this is worth the moneybanjokazooie is one of my favorite games and it works perfectly after all these years and being shipped around the country
perfectthis game is fantastic
personally i love it
have you ever played a game where an evil witch is ugly and wants to be evil so she steals a beautiful girl named tooty to try and transfer the beauty to the ugly witch
also have you ever played a game where a bear and bird have to collect golden puzzle pieces musical notes dinosaurs mixed with teddy bears named jinjos
also have you ever played a game where a shaman transforms the bear and bird into various forms
well if you havent this is where to start
this game is perfect for all ages
i would recommend this game to anyone who has a nive never really had enough of an attention span to play collect the item games but this particular one is really great
it has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me with honestly and unfortunately a terribly short attention span for hours at a time with enough elements of finding things youll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level
a truly great game and i wish more of the sort were made these days
i feel way too young to be saying this but they just dont make them like this anymoreon a side note the cartridge i received has some interesting connections
id guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as i do hahathis is one of the best games out there its a classic
banjokazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever the story is really good
a witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all
her brother and his pal kazooie have to save her
while its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like gold feathers red feathers and eggs
however if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered
while the game does have its flaws its still really fun to play
the game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game banjo tooie
the levels all relatively easy however it is very easy to die in this game on top of that like other reviewers on amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true
clarkers cavern was the worst because you only have  things of air and have to get extra air from a fish blowing bubbles
the level that is the most challenging of them all was click clock wood
because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me
however the most challenging and difficult part of this game is beating grunty herself
that is the most challenging part of this game
because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on rares part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game
overall despite its many flaws nintendo and rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing and the gameplay is awesome
buy it you wont regret itthis is one of my all time favorite games
the characters are likeable with hilarious dialogue and an intriguing story
also the music is some of the best ive ever heard in a video game
also the graphics and sound are great for n
the controls are crazy precise for n and man is this game challenging
there are lots of secrets to uncover and special power ups to unlock
if only microsoft hadnt ruined rarenow that banjo  kazooie is over five years old a sequel now exist and there is likely another game coming
hopefully
the game only for the n is one of the most amazing platformers ever
in fact its one of the most amazing games in any genre period
it took a while to beat the game but it was well worth it
if your not familiar with b  k let me explain banjo is a bear with a handy backpack
kazooie is a bird who hangs out in banjos backpack
with the many special moves kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit
together they work through many huge levels collecting items like puzzle pieces  hidden through out the entire game musical notes  on each level little jinjo people  on each level there are also mumbo skulls to find they allow you once you have the required amount to change form you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often
changing form is mandatory for instance b  k cannot fit into some smaller places
turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise
vast and adventurous b  k is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers
even if your just watching its entertaining
ill give you an idea of how effective the story is
banjo  kazooie is the wizard of oz of vidoe gamesi have never played anything like this since
everything from sly  racoon to ratchet and clank owe it to thiswicked witch gruntilda takes banjos sister to hey layer miles away in a realistic d cartoon worldbanjo is a bear with kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it
you solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps
mumbo jumbo transforms banjo into some other creatures along the way
you can fly
it was amazing
a full adventure all the way to end
we played it for months and i have never played anything like it again
the makers of donkey kong released it at the best time
it is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one
this is one of the best n games everthere is not much i can say except this is the best game for n
not too easy not too hard tons of levels and objectives and the cutest cast of characters jinjos rock if you like adventure games banjokazooie is for youbanjokazooie is an action adventure game in the style of super mario  however it is similar yet also quite different
rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game you learn a few in the very beginning and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds there are nine but they are much larger than the fifteen in mario 
notes are like coins and jiggies are like stars
however rather than six stars in each world there are  jiggies to find in each world and  in the witchs castle much like the castle secret stars
also you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor mumbojumbo
generally it will help you get at least  jiggy in the world and they can do things that banjo and kazooie cant on their own
throughout the game you get to transform into a termite level  an alligator level  a walrus level  a pumpkin level  and a bee level the nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother
but how fun are they
well theyre all very fun to play in mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music this game has that and then some
overall i highly recommend it
if you read my previous review of the game banjotooie youd see why i enjoyed the sound effects so much
once more i highly recommend this gamethis was purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter but since she was home for the holiday weekend i had her check it out
everything works greatafter rareware turned goldeneye into a systemseller for the nintendo  it broke out again with the actionplatformer banjokazooie
an ugly old witch named gruntilda has taken banjos sister tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her
banjo and kazooie the bird that lives in his backpack must brave gruntildas fortress to get tootie backthe plot is a little sugary and kiddie but its really just an excuse to send gamers on a mario style adventure where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore
yes its pretty much a clone of mario but at the same time it refines and enhances the mario formula
players have more unique special moves at their disposal and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles
worlds are beautiful creative and expansive tossing you into a room with a giant shark a huge snowman or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons
its all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment fades or grows louder depending on where you are in the stagethis is a game that has aged gracefully
yes its on an old system but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic mario titles and gameplay is solid
a masterful experience thats supplemented quite well by its sequel banjo tooieomgosh 
my son  grandson  and greatgrandson 
all three are totally enjoying this game soooooo much
im not any kind of a game player but it makes me feel so good just watching their enjoyment
thank you for a product that is not full of all that blood and gore that so many of the games have now daysbanjokazooie is a game that didnt really appeal to me at first
it looked to childish to easy and just basically stupid
comming from the  epic company rareware i was a bit more interested in what this game was  about
seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects i  realized i must give this game a try
well was i ever lucky to do so
keeping with the mario  type control style and the amazing graphics i  couldnt put the game down
even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games
the little things such as the mini games make this game even  better than it already was
imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand
these are only a few of the things you can do in the game
the game flows a little different than mario fans might be used to you  have many things to collect
for starters your main objective is to find  all the jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels
also music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair
and even little guys called jinjos are here for you to collect  so they can help you on your journey through a forest islands deserts  and many other worlds
if you have seen a rare game you know that they  have good graphics so no exception here very well done
the music is  also a plus feature on this game
with so many great reviews by people of  all ages and sexes you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not  buying this gamerareware  words fail me
again they have made a quality title beyond imagination
creative beyond a shadow of a doubt
  of people agree that banjokazooie is a landmark title with everything the n has to offer and that it is worthy of  out of  stars 
while developed early in ns lifespan the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released
the sound is equally as impressive for n and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed depending on your situationi am proud to say many people love this game
many of my friends still play it occasionally however few have beaten it all the way
this game is solid for  hours of gaming but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note and every other item
some people dislike it and do not be fooled a  year male old who listens to ultrahard rock and loves games with extreme violence andor nudity will not like this game
it is by no means for everybody
many gamers from preschool to high school will like it but not everybodythe controls are easy enough to master and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice
the sound is superb
the graphics are good for an n title
there is not a dull moment in this game and the attention to detail is amazing
the puzzles the meat of the game are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids
the puzzle peices your reward for completeing a puzzle are well hidden
the musical notes the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld are challenging to find
the most fun part of the game visiting mumbo is quite enjoyable
he transforms you into various forms
a fat walrus a termite and even a bumble bee
there isnt really an advancing story but thats okay
you get an occasional cinematic but its pretty basicthe story goesthe evil witch gruntilda is happily hanging out atop her mountain when the cute tootie sister of banjo the bear strolls by
overcome with jealousy she sees tootie is quite a bit cuter than her
so she kidnapps banjos sister and creates a machine to suck tooties cuteness out and put it into her
banjo and his sidekick breegull kazooie set off to find tootie
a mole named bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the gamewell i hope you enjoy this game
thanks for reading this review and until next timecrimsonredthis is the best n game ever made next to the wonderful ocarina of timei beat everything in it when i was i collected all the jinjosgot all the puzzle piecesetci bought it when i was its an amazingfun gamei just feel tormented that i had to use the players guide to beat the ndbanjotooiei try not to think about itbut this game is extremly hard and gruelingbut in a good waythe levels are extremly detailed and funmy favorite is the graveyardhaunted house level
i forgot its name
buy iti command youim so glad i was able to buy this game at a great price
i really enjoyed reliving my childhoodfirst off ive only owned two crash games
the first crash bandicoot and wrath of cortex for the ps
i played a demo for warped on my spyro the dragon game and wanted it ever since
i bought it on amazon and its safe for me to say thatthis is the crash i know and lovefor those who dont know crash bandicoot first came out in the s as a standard straightforward platformer
youre a mutated bandicoot named crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist drneo cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend
in warped dr cortex now works for uka uka the brother of aku aku an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world
he instructs cortex to go through time and collect crystals and gems that hold extreme power
crash has to literally race through time and jump spin and dance his way through time to retrieve them before cortex gets ahold of themthis game is just as fun as the first one
it brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on
the controls are spot on
you can build momentum for jumps move in any direction and really i never had problems with the controls even in the first crash
one thing i really love about this one is that i dont feel bad when i die
this game has some really interesting death scenes rather youre forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince eaten by lions thrown into the screen by a twoheaded fat person or so on
when i finish the game i plan on seeing how many ways i can die some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through
the boss battles are really diverse and take strategy timing and skill to get rid of
i must confess i found the first boss and  worlds extremely easy
its not until the  that the game just goes f this
im gonna make your time a living hell
its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what i said above
i also noticed something that first caught my attention in wrath of cortex
the game seems extremely open when it comes to lives
seriously im not even half way through the game and all ready up to  almost
i guess im that good at playing
im definately buying the second onei admit im disappointed at the way the turn the series have made
i wish they kept it as a patformer and just added maybe some adventure elelments to it like they did twinsanity even though its glitchy as hell
naughty dog where did you go
crash bandicoot warped is just what i expected it to be
its funny addicting challenging and overall just shows graphics dont make the game but its content and gameplaythis is one of my favorite games of all time
in this game there are  different levels that are mostly composed of the same d crash levels that were used to
some levels however you get to use a biplane motorcycle or jet ski
like the previous versions of crash you have to collect crystals and gems
now you can also collect a relic for having the best time
the music is fun the controls are easy and its just an overall great game for any agecrash is my favorite videogame character i remember playing it when it first came out with my sister on the ps waaaaay back this is so fun
i love this game
just buy itttti cant even begin to explain how much i love this game as well as the second crash bandicoot gamei havent played the first game yet because they are so much fun with lots and lots of humorous levels and disastersbandicoot is a marsupial on a muey dangerouso quest to collect  crystals and  relics in a quest to stop dr neo cortex and aku akus evil twin uka ukas quest to take over the worldthere are so many things that make this game so addictive
the music
its so hilarious
the complex levels
the graphics are so awesome
the way crash dies ie
falling off screen and his shoes fly up and fall back down being sucked into a giant spinning vase and the lid closes on top of itby god to really even explain how great this game really is is difficult for melike sonic the hedgehog was for sega and mario was for nintendo crash is for the playstationin this day and age of excessively bloody and violent video games the crash bandicoot series is a great sigh of relief
i tend to enjoy sillier cartoonish games like this
i will never tire of this gamecant review this title now cuz i still havent officially finished crashs  i bought it to have
im a classic game collector at heart dont know when ill start playing but i will eventually
now that its in my librarygraphics   the best visuals of the series
the colours shine fantastically and it all looks stunningly beautiful
the characters are clear and the game has backgrounds i could feast onsound   great uses of evil voicing and fantastic sound editing detail makes crash s sound get a notch upvalue   youll be begging for moreoverall   fantastically detailed game that mixes genres and characters into a big story that erupts with fabulous enjoyment
in short buy itall right for the guys that hate to read a lot about real quick if you like d platform action adventure titles and maybe you like cb just one thing get it
ok now to business i have been in the world of video games since atari  and colecovision so after more than  years of gaming i know of what i am talking about if i say its worth is worth it
but the final word is always yoursgameplaythis game has everything you need for hours of high quality of gaming experience the art concept of the game goes over expectations of the hardware limitation of the pso the design of every single element in the game is very creative and unique the developers invested time on the comedy of the game which is a tradition on the original trilogy as usual the controller its a wonder no need to struggle controlling the character and it vibrates as well the powers the moves and the style of the main character cb its superb every part of the game becomes fun not repeatable pattern of enemies or levels the game itself has a lot of extras for a replay definitely an outstanding gamedifficulty
 platinum relicscurse frustration but with practice you might become a cbw masterplotwell do not expect a twisted chrono trigger plot
as always in crash games the lack of plot its compensated with a beautiful work in the software itself basically crash goes trough a set of portals using n cortex once again his back with an ally own technology through time and space the main thing is of course stop them
graphicsthis is the strongest part of the game no doubt the game is programmed to utilize most of the potential of the pso gpu they managed to create excellent crystal effects
 water
 light sources and shiny surfaces like chrome and ice
one of the few games that deserve to be owned forever unopened
 one the few great looking games for psooverallperfect over all score
once again if you thing you can beat the game with one hand attached at your back and with folded eyes try getting beyond  and all the platinum relics the real gamer and fans of the series did it
look for it on you tube so the difficulty is very acceptable
this is by far the best crash bandicoot game by far since i personally thing that going trough naughty dog to travelers tales lost a bit of formula of this great franchise but oh well see yaswell lets end the crash bandicoot trilogy on playstation with crash bandicoot  warped
this game was released in  and was once again developed by naughty dog published by sony computer entertainment and distributed by universal interactive studios
it was originally a playstation exclusive but was later rereleased as a ps one classic on the playstation storethe games story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the cortex vortex come crashing down to earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as uka uka who is aku akus evil twin brother aku aku is the mask that helped crash out in the first two games
uka uka joins with doctor neo cortex and doctor nefarious tropy as they plan to gather crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the earththe game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game
you can not only play as crash but also as his sister coco who was a supporting character in the second game
you travel back and forward in time to gather the  crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does but dont worry the levels are completely different from each the second game
the game takes place in the timetwisting machine which acts as the hub area of the game
the machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start
each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels
the goal is the same as the second game obtain the crystal hidden in the area
some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race
the gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes or completing a hidden level or task
once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back
by defeating the boss the next chamber will become available to play
by defeating a boss you unlock a new power theres the super slam which makes your body slam more powerful the double jump a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprintthe newest main feature in the game is the relics which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game
after you obtain a levels crystal you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail
the goal is to reach the end as fast as you can but there are some differences there are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die you have to start the level from the beginning but there are plenty of aku aku masks to help you and thats pretty much it
it proves to be very challenging and getting the platinum relics is insanely difficult and even i never managed to get all of themthis game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall period
i would highly recommend getting this game off the playstation store for  this is a must play
it really is one of the bestfinal rating   out of im a big crash fan and got this game the christmas it came out
this game is incredible
its easy enough for young kids about  or  or even really experienced gamers age depending
it has very good graphics for a ps game and you can use the dual shock or regular controls in this
unlike former crash games you use more devices than before and in some levels are actually coco crashs intelligent little sister
for examplebaby tiger ridden by cocobaby trex ridden by crashjet ski mobile ridden by cocomotorcycle ridden by crashfastmoving spaceship ridden by cocobiplane with guns ridden by crash and coco level dependingunderwater jet ski mobile ridden by crashadditionaly you get to fight other bosses and defeating each boss earns you a special item
there are  in all super body slam lets you break through protected crates double jump allows you to jump over higher obstacles tornado spin spins around wildly helps you glide over bigpits fruit bazooka a giant gun that can blast away your enemies
 speed shoes gives you power to run used to get certain relicsthe final thing crystals gems colored gems and relicscrystals right on the path for normal levels
theyre thin and pink
touch them and youve obtained them
just beat the level to earn one after you pick them up
one per normal levelgems to get these break all the boxes in the level
sometimes youll have to have earned a color gem to get a gem
 to  per normal levelcolored gems  in all one every  levels  normal levels  secret levels
they serve as platforms to new areas in some levels
to get them ride on a platform in some levels for the platform to appear you have to not have died up to that platform
one in a level every  levelsrelics a new addition
after you get the relic in the level go back and get the relic by going as fast as you can through the level and getting a certain time
there are three typessapphirethe basic
you can get this with no speed shoesgoldmore advanced
most level you need speed shoesplatinumexpert level
extremely hard to aquire
lots of practice neededthats pretty much all that you need to know
all i can say is besides the tips have funi would say this is one of the the best ps games ever
i play it on my psit is fun from riding a tiger to running around spinning bad guys
this is child friendly but also adults love itit has good graphics good gameplay good ideas and lots of levels and replay value
get this you wont miss outwhat is it a such a funny game than sonic you konw that fighting with cortex is bad idea because his boss have came uka uka the evil twin brother of aku aku
aku aku is good hearted mask man who can help crash for his mission
now you can counter boss in each level such in castle area you will encounter tiny tiger can i tell you how to reach boss finsh all levels bring pink cristals to get rid of all stages 
but each places contains these things
and when you collect in each five warps cotians boss when you collect all of then than see six stage will apper kill each boss to unlock anthother warp room near your fisrt warp room
now can i tell you about boss in frist warp room cotians tiny tiger
then in second warp room cotains dinogldile boss
then in thrid warp room cotains drntrophy
then in fourth warp contains ngin
then in fiveth warp room contains drcortex and uka uka
this warp rooms where made by dr ntrophy master of times and it is not genethis game takes months to get  completion
the new feature in this is getting time rellicksby doing level fastand swimming
in crash  you get balders after you sometimes in crash  you get a dinosaur i prefered being chased by a balder and when it squashed crash it went into the screen but you dont get it in thisbuy this if you want a platformerafter crash  and the crash games for playstion are very fun gameseven better than the mario games
out of the crash seires i think this one is the best
there are alot of thing you can do and the bosses rock
the story line is the best in this game
it takes plase after crash were drcortex ship falles down on a temple wich releses a demon mask
the mask that pertected crash in the first two games stats talking and tells crash that the evil mask is his brother and his plan to build a time machine to get crystles todestroy earth
the replay vaule is high and the gamplay is fun you wont be able to put this game down for awilethe original crash game was very hard to beat
it was still classic
then crash  came out with several hard levels and tough bosses
then out came this one crash warped
this is the cult classic of the series
i have beaten the entire game and never once been disappointed because of too much or too little challenge
i even managed to get a  file with the help of my brother and a twerp i know
there are two secret levels
they are eggipus rex and hot coco
to get to eggipus rex  you go into time trails in the dino might
level
then board the yellow gem platform
keep running until you find the second pterydactyl the triceratops will be already chasing you and let it take you away
to get into the hot coco level simply crash into the road sign with an alien on it in the road crash level
this game is a classic and every ps one or ps owner needs to have it
was this review helpful
of course it waseven though this game is so goodi think you should get spyro  firstspyro the dragon gets you to a demo that leads to thisi know youll like itif you have spyro  then try the demothat is what i didlet me tell you all about this great game
i wouldnt want to give the story away but let me tell you the original two are no match for this great game
this game has  new colorful and nice levels and  hidden ones
almost all of them have nice and pretty graphics
there are more features too
for one thing there is the time trial mode in which you go through the levels in a certain amount of time and you will get relics
you can play as coco riding her adorable tiger pura a jetski a blimp and a couple more
crash himself can do some more things like a super belly flop a double jump a triple spin use speed shoes and use a fruit bazooka for long range attacks
also he can ride an airplane a motorcycle a baby trex and more
also even dying is humorous
now for the games one flaw it is hard to be challenged
however there are  types of relics
if you get all of the sapphire relics you can get a really good ending
if you get all the gold relics you get 
but the platinum relics require a master to collect
so if you like all thats said and even if you didnt you will definitely love itthis is a very good gameit is very challenging it has lots of levels and i managed to get  but the ps crash is more challenging but the bad thing of the ps crash is that the loading takes more than  minutesi got this game when i was like years old and i still play itim  now
i think all the crash bandicoots were a new cahnge for psx and i hope that they continue to stick with psxthis is a great game
i played this all the time when i was younger and had to have it now as an adult
play it all the timethis is the best platform game ive played and eliminates all down sides of its two prequels
youre a bandicoot and jump on  spin baddies you encounter
this game is kind of like old mario games but has awesome graphics
theyve added a type of box to the prequel and give one move such as bazooka or tornado death spin for each boss
the game is easy to beat but offers extras for breaking all the boxes or beating a level quickly
its extremely difficult to collect all of them
i recommend this game for everyone especially people with a lot of free time on their handsthis game is just as much fun as the first one with whole new levels based on the now classic crash bandicoot gameplay i would recommend this to anyone crash fan or notgolden eye  is still one of the best action titles ever created along with the best licensed product ever released
the action is still superb and wellpolished even since its release  years ago
the enemies are still smart even with competitors like fear
which have incredibly intelligent artificial intellignce
there are a couple of issues unfortunately some targeting problems and odd save layouts
other than those this game is still one of the best shooters ever made
the missions are excellent the enemies are cool the weapons are cool and virtually everything else about this game is superb and wellexecuted
too bad nintendo handed the rights of james bond to eafirst the single player is awesome
then the multiplayer battle gets even better
but then when you add game shark it becomes the best game ever
one problem is that it is a bit unrealistic because there are up to  shots in a clipmagazine
otherwise the game is good
also if you like this game you will want perfect dark
if you like this game but wish it was more realistic get rainbow sixwith this game you play through each level in the movie
this is when james bond was james bond
you can choose from a whole list of players to choose from to play as
you can get any kind of weapon just about through the whole game
and you can even play with some friends on missions
if you have never played a n what are you waiting for
 out of   super funthis is game was based on the movie and they hit it spot on
playing the levels are fun but this is the perfect game to play if you are just sitting around with a few friends talkin about the old timeswith the nintendo  beginning to slowlyokay quickly drop off the gaming radar its time for gamers who bought the last of the big ns cartridge systems to see if their investment was a good one
is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore
is there one game to give you an excuse to say to playstation and xbox and gamecube owners i know its an old system but this game is the reason i still own it
yes and that game is called golden eye its hard to believe that a game based off the best of the pierce brosnan bond movies would become an undeniable classic
but thats exactly what golden eye is
many firstperson shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players
thankfully golden eye is the diamond in the rough
it takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination
moving bond james bond is as easy as breathing and the shooting system is just as simple
even with the horrible n controller a player can learn how to play golden eye on the first or second try
and its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate ai
of course because of the ns difficulttoprogram cartridge format some things had to be sacrificed like detailed textures and realistic ai responses to being shot
but the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial mattersgraphically golden eye  was a marvel to look atwhen it was first released
nowadays when compared to games like metal gear solid  for the ps and dead or alive  for the xbox golden eye looks like a snes game
because cartridges are limited in space textures can be bland character models look blocky and detail is kept to a passable minimum
but anyone who doesnt care about graphics as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent shouldnt have any trouble with golden eyesoundwise its not the biggest strength of the game but its still good
sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done  a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it at least to a certain extent
and voices while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs suit the game well
it wouldve been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters but the limitations of the cartridge format doesnt help this area muchall in all golden eye is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming
while the n is arguably one of the worst nintendo consoles to be released alongside the horrendous virtua boy it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the gamecube was announced
golden eye is not only the game that many fps fans point to as their favorite game but many nonfps gamers also found it very enjoyable
while later great firstperson shooters like the ns perfect dark and the recent xbox millionseller halo presented excellet fps action with updated graphics to boot golden eye will forever be remembered as the firstperson shoot for the massesif you need a reason to keep your n this is itgoldeneye  is the best game for the nintendo  its an amazing game and its still fun to play today
there was a game called perfect dark that was similar to this and came out later but this is the far better game
tons of great guns and gadgets are here and the gameplay is awesome
its not the best first person shooter everhalo for xbox is but its still one of the best
the graphics arent the best ever right now but at the time in  or so they were real great
the music is good
it has a mysterious sound to it for some reason
this game has some of the best levels in any game and it controls great
multiplayer in this game is some of the most addictive ever
at the time it had the best multiplayer around
it might not now since there are games like halo and diablo ii but like i said it was the best at the time
there arent really any negatives
all hail to the best game on n and one of the best games evergoldeneye  at first glance looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated firstperson shooter game genre
the big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translationin a word goldeneye is amazing
it takes full advantage of the  bit technology and delivers a smooth fun and challenging adventure
you assume the role of james bond the secret agent who needs no introduction
you run through various missions which tie into the movie and solve various problems and perform various tasks
what complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight
as expected you have a number of weapons at your disposal from the silenced pistol and machine gun to the grenade launchers and highpowered explosives
the firstperson perspective adds amazing realism to this game with action and controls that are as smooth as james bonds charmthe graphics are phenominal with smooth movements and amazing scenery
this game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures
the music is right out of a bond movie and adds a nice edge to the action
the controls usually quite clunky on that horrible n controller are easy to manage here
after a while it becomes like second naturefor parents considering this game for their children they should be aware of the violence
much of the game is spent killing people and the realism is striking
it is up to you but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictivethis game has plenty of levels weapons and it has challenging gameplay with a pretty good multiplayer but i wish u could face computers in the multiplayer good graphics great play control and sound get this game if u dont already have perfect darkin the year  goldeneye was released for the nintendo  by rare an unknown company and new nd party developer
rare had already made several games for the nes and enters the nintendo  market with this release based on the classic james bond movie of the same title
you can ask anyone who had a nintendo  if they ever played this game and why it was so popular
youre guaranteed to hear  reasons in particular why this game is so reveredreason  this game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game
it was more than  years since the movie it was based on came out and rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other james bond movies such as oddjob and mayday
they didnt rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake
this game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamersreason  nintendo had no idea that the multiplayer section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode
rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multiplayer mode until later in its development stages
though it may be limited by todays standards you had the basics several stages based on the single player mode all of the weapons were available all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match team death match you only live twice  lives etc
and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match
this added a lot of replayability after you finished the single player modeif you dont have a nintendo  this game is reason enough to get it
this game helped nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title i highly recommend getting if you can find it
its a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with  of your friends
peacethis game offers it all
shooting action adrenaline pumping duck and dodge fire fights rescue missions covert action gadgets evil villains story and plot and a lot of weapons
i reccomend this to any gaming fan
buy this game right now
you dont know what youre missing if you dont
the game also offers an incredible ammount of replay value with dozens of cheats that can be activated by getting record times in levels and also two levels that can be activated by beatin gthe game on different levels of difficulty
all in all a completely amazing game
buy it
dont hesitateeven for a gamecube and ps owner for me this is the game that started it all
and while old goldeneye is still exhilerating
i was stupid enough to trade in my goldeneye copy for a nwer but not better game
dont make the same mistake that i did please
it is hard to get your hands on a good copy of goldeneye these days
protect your goldeneye games
this game lives up perfectly to the movie and for a  game the graphics and sound are excellent
sure nightfires fun but it never revolutionized the gaming world like goldeneye did
goldeneye shoots twine and agent under fire out of the sky
nightfire cant even hold its ground against this solid and superb n title
in goldeneye you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the goldeneye film and the single player campaign holds its ground
but multiplayer is where the game really shines and it is so much better than timesplitters or timesplitters  even
i have not played goldeneye for over a year but the music rings in my head and i have the levels memorized perfectly
even if you worship your perfect dark copy i believe that goldeneye is better and i have a strong debate on that
the bottom line is that goldeneye is the best fps ever created
it boils down to thisif you own an n please play your goldeneye copy or if you dont even know what this wonderful game is about buy it now
hey all xbox owners goldeneye is even better than halo
theres no debate on that
buy the game that started it allmy ratingyes this game has very good game play it has  levels to unlock and  secret levels and very good you will wanna play this game over and over be cuz of all the secrets u can find if use a game shark u can get all of the old beta stuff and this game is a must have the world is not enough  was good but its game play died it only has  levels and twine was not very good maybe voice was in it but it is not better then goldeneye  u must buy this game its a james bond classic this game is always to get it and put it in your  and turn up the heat but twines mutl player make u get sick of the game goldeneye may have bad mutl player but its better twine has arond  guys to pick from for mutli have fond memories of this game and still get together to play it with friendsbefore goldeneye first person shooters were primarily pc affairs played with a keyboard and mouse and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities which at the time i didnt have
goldeneye changed this
just like mario kart you could get four players hooked in
except instead of bumping bowser off a race track you were running around and laying down the heat as bond or one of his alliesantagonists
there are plenty of modes arenas and weapons to choose from ranging from deathmatch to flag tag
and once in a while you have to play with slappers only
in addition to the multiplayer aspects it has an excellent singleplayer mode
its mission objective based meaning that failure is entirely possible and as difficulty increases so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfillthe music is also notable
sure its entirely synhtesizedmidi but in those days that was the state of the art
the music fits the scenes pretty well mostly being varied riffs on the classic john barry bond theme some being a little differentthe game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock  by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectiveswhether youve never played this classic or youre looking back on the good old days you should play it
thisis rares n masterwork  perfect dark is pretty sweet tooalright this will most likely be the only time i will ever give a n game  stars but for goldeneye i eill make an exception
ok goldeneye was s jump into the world of high tech video game systems but unfortunately they couldnt keep it up
this was a very solid st person shooter excellent graphics  and not even repetitive secenary what more could you ask for in a game
the weapons were great maybe a little exaggerated at times but over all good
long levels and lots of them made this game excel in the lasting appeal category
sound was good but not having the cd quality sound os a ps or a dc hirt it a little
unfortunately goldeneye got a little smack in the face when everybody started comparing it to the flopped perfect dark game
but overall a great game and even though i am a die hard playstation fan i still have a place in my heart for goldeneyewhen i purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo  i used to play this hours on end doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer
after the playstation  came out i pushed the nintendo  over for a few weeks but i found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo  gamesnow that i have a  i rarely play goldeneye anymore
but with the recent purchase of a n i have again found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful fun cheats that it offers
this game changed the way we play games totally
it is still one of the best games i own right next to the newest xbox  gamesthis is a cool game
you complete every mission on  agent and you unlock the  difficulty level
you dont need a memory pak or card to play this gamei played this game when i was about  and im now  and still love it to the death literally
i have a blast shooting other things other than just people and watching bullet holes go into the items and how it looks so freaking real
i also have always loved how you can choose many different people in  player mode such as  to scientist
the golden gun is the coolest because it only takes on shot to kill but if you like a really smashing good time you can always punch or cut your way out
a must have game for the  i love this game
it is so funny and a bit hard to beat
the hardest level is in the temple where a shuttle is launching and you have to collect data kill jaws get launch tape and launch the shuttle
my favorite level is the facility level
that level is so funny and you can shoot the scientists but it will fail the mission if they were killed
my cousin and i love to blow up the enemies and scientists
my favorite is shooting the scientists and enemies in their butts and they would jump up and down rubbing their butts and then they will fight back and the scientists will threw grenades at you
the controls are easy and this game is better and funnier than the movie
buy this gameawesome controls greta levels killer music loads of cool guns and awesome james bond
the perfect shooter
played this one a loti still get this game out
everything is ideal if they cant recreate this it will be a shame
n ruled in the old days this and mario were so amazingly fun it was constant you could play for months on end and still love it to death while finding something entirely new and excitingthis game is a keeper to have and i wouldnt mind playing another james bond game which im getting from russia with love
and that means there will be more fights to the end
i just keep playing this game over againthough wolfenstein d and the doom franchise had come and gone long before its time goldeneye for the nintendo  grabbed the first person shooter genre and ran with it for what seemed like miles and miles
forget a touchdown this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards with three interceptions and a dozen field goals
nothing on a home console was even close to its league
and even today in the afterglow of behemoths like halo metroid prime and a limitless roster of pc shooters the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitationsits difficult to call any game perfect
no matter how original how exciting how breathtaking it may look sound play or feel there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas and goldeneye is no exception
most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers
no lie ive memorized the layout of a base from start to finish known theres nowhere these soldiers could be coming from and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers attack
it makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits end
in addition theres the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way
every once in a while an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand blankly staring for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor
this wouldnt be such a bad thing if the other soldiers bullets couldnt pass right through him
so youll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body
despite my small misgivings however  of this game plays flawlessly
the progression of difficulty is astounding moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the carts conclusion
and its all done while walking that razors edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving
the player realises these missions are possible even as hes watching bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutesadd to all that three difficulty levels cheats that must be unlocked with speed precision and overall knowhow hidden stages and hidden characters
not only do you have a legendary fps youve also found nearly limitless replay value
goldeneye is more than just a very good game its the stuff legends are made of
its a game youll want to play with your grandkids years from nowhands down the most attractive part about bonds n debut even today is its controls
the nintendo  controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with s repertoire as every button is in precisely the right place for its function
it truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master
the center grip of the n controller seems to become the handle of a silenced pp bonds revolver of choice
the z button is a perfect trigger and if youve purchased a rumble pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire
strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle
no control system has ever felt so immersive so right
after the first level you hardly recognize the controller is there its already become such an extension of your own body
i cant sing any higher a praise than thatif youve seen the feature film of the same name youll notice some eerie similarities
everything from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen
its honestly unsettling how well the level designers did their jobs
ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film
youll get your chance to find the answer on the n
its an experience i cant really put into words something id never seen before and havent seen since
its a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaptionfinally theres the multiplayer aspect of  while the singleplayer mode is challenging unique and groundbreaking multiplayer is absolutely unreal
i had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released and thus experienced more multiplayer bond than id wish on anyone
there were literally lines leading into my room just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action
it was an addictive community event whenever that little red light on the front of our n lit up
truly something special
with multiple modes of play a handful of playable levels some hidden surprises and dozens of options you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice and it didnt take much for the lighthearted action to become a coldhearted war
in a time and place where four player deathmatches are a nobrainer its hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field
goldeneye blazed that path and did so in style
it cleared out the weeds flattened the hills and paved the roads that halo drives its way across today
truly the game was revolutionary and it still plays as suchin short goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a nintendo  even today
theres a charm about it that cant be described a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay
its got the look and feel of a legend and thats exactly the word id use to describe it
while there are certainly flaws this is a game youll kick yourself for never owning in a few years when it becomes increasingly difficult to track downgoldeneye became the steeple for how the bond series was going to be and im glad that it was because for me i could never get tired of this game because of its awesome challenges graphics gameplay and of course the gore factor very bloody game
maybe a no for younger gamers but for those of us older gamers a definitelevel after level this game played almost to a t like the movie and you got to use all of bonds weapons from his magnum to a bazooka to grenades and plastic explosives and of course the one hit kill golden gunthis also had the perfect multi player vs mode in the history of the  system
where else could you blow up  of your friends with a bazooka at the same time if you were lucky enough to stumble upon them shooting it out with each othergoldeneye has never left my  rotation and again i still love to play the multi player when my friends come over
i will again stress to those of us who are parents like myself that you should maybe think otherwise if you have some young gamers because it is very violent and very bloody
for those of you without that restriction go wild and get this game
you wont be disappointedgoldeneye  was simply the greatest game ever made
no if ands or buts
this game stood out from the rest giving itself the title of the almighty master of the game worldmy uncle steve was the first person to tell me about the game in  and told me i had to get goldeneye and told me its the best game he ever played and he only had a playstaion at the time
i played this game when it first game out i was  years old and im now  and still love it to the deathgoldeneye set the standards for every fps that has followedever since i purshased goldeneye  on the old n i became highly addicted to it like many other gamers around the world
i also have to thank this game as well because it made me a hardcore james bond fanthis is the best firstperson shooting game ever
although dated the detail of this game is amazing
theres over  levels of shooting
my favorite missions are the first level the silo mission the train mission and the very last levelhighly recommended game it fuels the senses
if you like james bond or any type of video game get it
mostly all of you havei got this game when it first came out which was a couple years ago but im just now writing the review strange isnt it
this game is what makes having an n so great
the graphics are just sweet
the story pretty much follows the movie and alters a little things to make it more enjoyable for us gamers
this game is very easy to control
thats one of the best things about it
the controls are placed if logical places and its better than the turok controls
the best part of this game is the multiplayer
its what made the game so famous
killing your friends has never been this much fun
ill never get tired of one of my friends walking in a hallway unsuspecting that a proximity mine is waiting there to take his digital life
the best multiplayer level has got to be the facility
but ill let you the buyer decide for yourself
another game i recommend and thats probebly better is perfect darki am a major player of  games
i have played nearly every single one but i have to say goldeneye is one of the best that there is even years and platforms later
even though i have a gamecube with all of the other  games i still to this day find myself returning to play a round of goldeneyegoldeneye has a great plotline in my opinion even better than the movie and long missions which allow a lot of replay value
the graphics are a bit blurry but that is to be expected in an n fpsoverall i love this game and would reccomend it to any  fanone of the games that made n so great had graphics for the time multiplayer all around fun and in my opinion one of the best games of its timegoldeneye  is one of the best games for the nintendo  when you hear pepole say the game is great there not kiddin
ive had this game for a while and im still coming back to it
its an  replay value
id give goldeneye  more stars if i could
if you want a game that you can come back to years later and a great game for alot of pepole then get goldeneye another rareware classic
the game that defines st person shooter
like the title says rare did it best
i love the pc shooters like doom quake  duke nukem
but  did it 
the first of its kindperfect d graphics   control
and the first game to do stealth right
you can sneak through levels stealth with your silenced pistol or go all out nuts with the ak
this model of game would go on to influence all future fps
ps  xbox fanboys take notice
if rare hadnt come up with this formula modern warfare  halo wouldnt exist as they arefor its timegoing back and replaying this game is weird and fun
its fun to see how bad the graphics were and how you didnt see it that way back in the dayconsidering how easy it is to buy old games this is a must buyi remember playing multiplayer tournaments on this when i was younger and still play against my son when i cangolden eye on the nintendo  needs no introduction it redefined the fps genere it had great controlls for its day stuck as close as it could with the movie it was a major killer app for the  around   the music was good the graphics were decent enough there dated now but this game was  still is the t golden eye never has failed on any level i still play it from time to time  the multiplayer back in the summer of  me my friends or my brother or his friends or my cousin we all played the multiplayer to death
should you get this game well its been out since the late s   if you never played it your missing out it warrants a purchase of a n  for this game alone
golden eye for the  is as good if not better than moviei thought that id review some james bond  video games the games that i own
you know its going to be the th anniversary this year which i might see skyfall but im here to review the best  game by far golden eye on the nintendo  which was a game that was only exclusive to the n meaning back in  it was like hey you need to go out  buy a nintendo  i remember playing this game a lot in  its an amazing game all around of course the multiplayer is what stands out i played it a lot with my brother my friends  cousin a lot
the single player mode is well done the game play is great  the weapon selection is the best of all the  games
for what it is it does a good job of following the movie golden eye going through the st  levels it deals with the beginning of the movie
where you think  alec treyvelyn was kill  where bond escapes in the plane
there is a level you saw in the movie servenya that you go to
you have to go there twice the nd time is where you meet natalya who in the movie you meet in the helicopter explosion
of course you meet janus at the statue park who turns out to be treyvelyn
you get to use a tank just like in the movie you get to go through the train depot which isnt in the movie the train level is pretty good  there are lines that alec treyvelyn says in the movie on this level
the last  levels is pretty much the movie towards the end
this game is  of the best st person shooters out there it changed the genre
if you never played golden eye on the n i cant reccommend it enough  im not talking about the new  which i have yet to playno doubt the best nentendo game ever created up till this day
this game is better than all the nentendo games for all its systems
it has the best multi player game ever for any system and a a single player game
the only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons
and the single player game is up there with metal gear solid the original
its game has lots of levels and is very challenging but in a good way
its cheat options are really hard to get but once you do it makes the game even more awsome
so overall you only need one word to describe this game spectacularthe levels are great and there is a lot to do to save the world in the nick of time before some bad happens
you as bond
as you go into the game they are other bad guys are trying to kill you as you try to save the world
hey buy this game you will have a time of you life and trying to stay alive
hey it true it is a good game to play by yourself or two people hey go buy the game and find out what iam talking about ok i play it over ten time because it great to get into
by the away they are four bad guys are after you so run run run for your life well just in the game are you lucky
dont spoil yourself over this game i have
keep your cool in the game so good lucky
ps your going to need it
there are easy levels and hard levels and there are very hard levels
get ready for a big adventure to save the world
there are characters in the game just like the movie is that cool or whatbrthis game more than any other for the nintendo  is what will come to mind when most ppl think of the n
mainly because this was one of the first shooter games to require the gamer to use his brain to solve puzzles and get thru the nasty surprises the game will throw at you
not following the bloodlust of previous first shooter games like doom heretic turok etc
this game is in a class of its own
it gives you objectives to complete however unlike perfect dark it adds to the challenge by giving you deadly surprises that are not mentioned in the mission breifing these will make at least restart a few levels over and over until you figure it out for yourself
its a much better game than any other first shooter ive played since it stresses stealthy behavior and intelligence on the part of the player to succeedgranted it does not have the extras in the multiplayer section that perfect dark has but it has an element of challenge that perfect dark will never havethis is one of my favorite fpss of all time
it stands right alongside halo and battlefield  the single player missions are done wonderfully the enviroments are great and the multiplayer is the best i have ever playedbuy thisthis is the one game that i would play day in and day out for more than a year
the one game where i discovered something new almost every time i played
it was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least  or  times a week
somehow it just wouldnt die no matter how hard we triedat first it just seemed so standard and bland
playing muliplayer for the first time i had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the temple level
soon somehow something clicked and me and my friends  ended up playing it for about  hours straight
towards the end of that introductory marathon goldeneye session we took our first stride out of the standard deathmatch restriction increasing my characters health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me
thus we coined the quotgodquot mode and we played this variant to death in the coming monthsit didnt end there
we had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches
we bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen lantype mode covering up other players screens so we wouldnt know where the other players were
we playedthe team mode constantly refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship
fed up with autoaiming we turned it off and further honed our skills
i began to be able to play the complex level in my sleep
proximity mines soon became an addiction
we pushed the game to its limits learning that we could move the ammo boxes shields and guns around by shooting them thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games
we began to use gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that werent intended for the final version as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players
we discovered a code that turned one player invisible and proceeded to do hunterhunted scenarios over splitscreenbasically it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities
it was a revolution for firstperson shooters and so many have overlooked this fact
it was the first to have targeting of individual body parts over  weapons to choose from realistic glass shooting out of lights and bullet holes and for its time fairly revolutionary ai
all in all it was an experience that defined video games for me and few if any have matched it with a similar addictive experiencethis is the best shoot em up on the n
i was very impressed with the game play the graphics the action the multi player fun everything the only downfall about the game is i wanted more more more
the cheats are great when you unlock them and the best thing is you dont need a memory card everything saves on the cartridge
rare actualy managed to compress a game that was too big for the n into this game somehow and it suprises me that it does not even use the n expansion pack to do that
this game is not just hoursand hours of fun but days weeks years 
i still play this cool game even todaygoldeneye  on the now obsolete ninetndo  is still to this day my favourite game of all time
before the nintendo  arrived i was a massive sega fan nothing anyone said could put me off my sega obsession
and then i played mario  and everything changed
i went out and swapped my sega saturn and all its games for a brand new nintendo  and a second hand copy of mario  and i never looked back
then allmost a year later goldeneye  arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre
you see before goldeneye i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me
i also happened to be a huge james bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time and i was not dissapointed
everything about this game just worked so well it had the right feel a bond game should have
it was also one of the most addictive multiplayer games ever
me and me mates would spend hours playing this game
the weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter
the snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun
since goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant halflife but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as rares wonderful game
if you havent played this yet then you dont know what youre missingvery good fps game although multiplayer mode does lag
highly recommend for your n collection
this one is a classiclordit has been too darn long since i last played this master piecethe single player mode is too much fun
but the  of the credit goes to the multi game modegreat selection of weapons nice variety of levels huge list of characters to choose from from the original bond movies fun options while playing bobble head characters paint ball shooting marksi am telling you the game was the center of attention with friends
large gatherings challenges playing till the break of dawn
i will give the game credit from keeping us off the streets  i dont know if i can find this game but boy if you can
find three friends and play it without mercyall the bestnawafgolden eye games that are coming out now owe their controls to golden eye
based on the movie the game is truly hard hiting gameplay action that is super fun
this game is a very great shooting game
one of the best shooting game of all time golden eye has a great story and goes along with the new  games that are coming out
redifine the origin by playing this game if you havent
sure the graphics arent that great but dude its nitendo  they should remake this game and other classic  games for nitendo gamecube
if you still play  god have mercy you will also love perfect darkif your buying this game for some reason you should add perfect dark
same game play action but for some reason i love quotperfect darkquot better
but thats mei loved this game and playing it now after all these years its still awesome
multiplayer on a split screen is still funthe multiplayer is amazing but most reviews already cover that
i still have yet to beat the last level cradle and the  bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after  years and yet i am addicted to trying over and over
i finished the campaign twice on the st  difficulties
each difficulty higher the more parts of the level you explore and the more crazy scenarios you will experience places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing
it is always fun trying to beat facility or bunker  with just a silenced pp without alerting anyone
nothing is more satisfying than shooting  gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm
in some levels if you are feeling arrogant you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo
there is so much about this game i could go on for days about how amazing this game is
no modern aaa fps has surpassed goldeneye on n campaign to this day
the remakes have been complete crap despite the amazing cod engine
if you own a n and love perfect dark or other great fps adventures you will love thisyeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone n magazines got better because of it
and bonded friends and family for years on end
there was no other game like it
empire magazine started writing better games reviews because of it
this was a mental good multiplayer in  we all played this side by side for years
i cant say i have played anything quite like it since
golden eye n
yeah those where the days
i remember this left playstation  owners in awei purchased this game after a nostalgia case i had lol and it worked just fine
i would buy another if this one failedmy n it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv
i bought a total of  count em  games on this pathetic system i have what about  for my computer
but this game made me believe that a good shooter could be made on consoles although very few of the ports from pc to consoles are usually the original games for the consoles are good
of those  games i have this one is worth about  the makers of this game are geniuses and have spread that on to other games like the timesplitters series if there is any game that will make me buy a gamecube besides metroid prime it is timesplitters  it is a master peace that will be lived on in my memories and it will remain stuck in my damn cartrage slot of my forgotten n or it would be forgotten if not for this gamethe names bond james bond
those five words mark the saying of probably on of the most famous fictional spy of all time
and finally he came to the nintendo  this game is by far the best game for any console
it kicks resident evils butt all the way back to campcoms facility to teach them not to make such stupid looking gamesgoldeneye set the standards for every fps that has followed
it is the best of the best
the levels are action packed and extremely memorable
i can do the levels in my head ive played them so many times
the graphics are dull now but back in the day these visuals were top notch
the music involves some of the best techno ive ever heard
the game is also surprisingly difficult
i took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels
the multiplayer is ahead of its time with four player large arena style deathmatches
this game should be missed by no one pick up a copy today and first hand see the bestpresentation this game captures what it is to be james bond
there are a great deal of weapons cool menus and music that still rocks to this day
all around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic
story the game follows the story of goldeneye pretty closely and there are two bonus levels that follow other bond movies
including one of the hardest levels of all time the aztec based on the movie moonraker
graphics this game looked amazing for its day now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of n looked liked
game play this is the part that could be helped by a remake
the n controller only has one joystick
this is awkward sometimes but the use of the cpad to strafe helps
nintendo please remake this amazing gem
sound some of the best music in a video game ever made
catchy music that i even have on my ipod to this day
lasting appeal i still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me
i can play levels in my head need i say more
this game will never be forgotten or equaled
rating this game was awesome when i was little and owned my original n and its still awesome to this day
you just cant outdo a good thing and this game proves itgolden eye is widely considered one of the best fps ever made
it is a great solid game and i recommend this game to everybodybrings back memories of days long gone by
as ive turned from kid to teen from teen to young adult and some day to old man the nostalgia and memory of my childhood in the s becomes ever more appealing to me
back in the days of summer vacations weekends off few worries and fewer obligations and responsibilitiesthis game may not have a lot of flashy features like sound or simulant multiplayer but who cares
i bought this game in  and i still play it
i recommend it to anyone who likes firstpersonshooters or a james bond fangoldeneye  is not only the best movie tiein game of all time but it is perhaps the most influential firstperson shooter ever to hit the gamingconsole market
if you arent aware of the plot of this game thats not a problem because essential it is the same as the popular james bond movie goldeneye which was released in  two years prior to this games releasethis is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives and difficult challenges
the ai
is smart especially on higher difficulty settings and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulty to any gamerthe introduction of logical hitpoints on your enemies is a great feature
even bosses in this game can be taken down with a wellaimed shot to the head
it is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your james bond and that you can sneak in sneak out covertly taking out henchmen as you go or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts
because of this there are many ways to beat the game and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks
aka you can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levelsand if you dont have a strategy guide youll have to find out those paths by yourself which i might add is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day awaythis is one of those games that the more you play it the more youre able to value its contributions to the gaming industry
each time i play it i notice aspects that have been replicated in many following fps games
so if you have a nintendo  go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of goldeneye  because trust me as a bond fan and a casual gamer i can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of james bond or just have an awesome intense gaming experience
also make sure to look out for its sister game perfect dark which is also on the n following the same controls and very similar weapon useshandsdown the best n game
goldeneye is very similar to the movie like the siberian dam mission the satellite control facility etc the graphics are the best ive seen for the n except for zelda  the first one
the autoaim feature and person multiplayer make the game perfect for the common area of a dorm roomgoldeneye lookes like just another shootem up game but it is more than that
goldeneye takes james bond to the next levelpros graphics are great player is funlots of cheats to make the game even betteralot of characters to choose fromcons a little to easy to beatno voices during game playnot alot of multiplayer levelsin the end goldeneye is a great game and i recommend it to anyonebefore this the racing games were race around a track and did not have to save the game
then when gt came out the racing really improved dramatically you can unlock cars tracks
plus you can save and you can upgrade in this one i believe
after this every game then racing games started to be like gt series
this is one of the best and most popular game series from sony
try this outthis is by far undeniably the racing game to havea game with over  cars to choose from
unheard of at the time this games got over  folksa game with truetolife car physics sounds and handling
get real right
nope all herea game with so much customization import tuner companies piss their pants
its all heregran turismo is the original racing simulator that started it allyou start off with a measly  bucks
that all but gets you a clunker of a car which after beating a bunch of drivers ed tests you can use to sneak your way through a few raceswinning a bit of cash and some cars you can either sell or save to tune lateruntil you can finally buy your dream car which for me was the acura nsx type szero the first time i played through itlet me just stress how perfect this game issure your first time through it youll take a hairpin turn at grand valley way too fast spin out of control scream yell and curse at the tv maybe throw and break your controller as you finish in last placebut over time youll feel so much utter control of your car that any shimmy or shake the car makes while cornering or countersteering or powersliding youll know exactly how to correct it
no two cars in the game handle the same
you have your ff fr mr and wd drivetrainssimply you have it all herethe graphics in the game push the playstation to the limitthis gt and r ridge racer type  are by far the bestlooking racing games on the original playstationthere are hordes of races to race and multiple cars to win so the replay value is through the roofmy absolute favorite part about the game is finetuning the gear ratios of a fullytuned supercharged turbo monster of a car and trying to get every last ounce of power out of it for a top speed at the test track
ive literally spent days at a time fiddling with the gear ratios on a car knowing that someway somehow id be able to squeeze another  or  mph out of it
not only thatadjusting the cars ride height affects top speed and acceleration toomy personal best was achieving  mph with the mitsubishi gto twin turbo mrit took me at least  hours to get it from its standard  mph top speed it gets with all of the top performance parts and no fiddling with gear ratios or anythingthe one and only downside to the game is that you only get  for any car you sell that you won from a tournament
even a car that you know should rake in way more than just klike say for instance the tvr cerbera lmother than that this game is absolute perfection  out of i was looking for a racing video game for my new playstation and everyone i talked to told me to get gran turismo
and now i know why
its so fun
its challenging but not impossible
the graphics are good and realistic and there are tons of cars to choose from
i really like the simulation mode where you can race for money and buy new cars or upgrade old ones
im a huge fan of my dodge viper with racing stripesone thing thats not so great about this game is the space that it takes up on your memory card
just to have a simulation mode game going you need  empty blocks
if you want to get into saving replays and stuff it can use up to  blocks
memory cards are expensive im not willing to devote an entire memory card to one game no matter how great it isi play this game with the interact wheel this game is very fun not as good as the other ones thoe always love gran turismo so i wanted the ones from ps
this came in good condition and with all the manuals too
pretty sweet this game is almost  years old and its still aroundgraphics   you can see some of the computerised effects you crash or something but all of the graphics in this game look good and give feel to the competitionsound   there could be a bit more commotion when you crash or flip or something but the engines vrooming gives you a thrill and the creaking sound of the breaks is eyewideningvalue  this game is seriously worth the money
the word value is essential when buying a game and you get your moneys worth and more
in short get it nowoverall   fabulously entertaining and complex car game that really lives up to its reputation
youll be playing it in your sleepthis game does seem a bit lacking after playing the other games in the franchise but holds up well if you dont mind the graphicsbuyer beware
watch out for copies that dont read greatest hits on
seems there was a bug that wouldnt allow you to get  in the game
these copies alway have been known to wipe out your garagewhen this game came out i was a pimply faced highschool kid
all i wanted was a car heck even a drivers license would do
the closest thing i could get to driving a real car was playing games like well playing games like ummm
well there were no games even close to driving a real carthen one day at funcoland i picked up a magazine and read about this new game comming out called gran turismo and how it was the ultimate car game
they used real cars and physics to make the game that much authentic
it was the closest a pimply faced highschool kids dream come true
this wasnt just another mash the gas driving game this was a revolutionary driving experiencei slapped my  bucks down on a preorder that day
when gran turismo was realised it changed all driving games as you know it
all i remember was this being the first driving game that took cars seriously and i dont know about you but the first time i loaded in that disk and saw all those car names flashing across the screen i almost wet my pants in exctasy
this was the driving game i had been waiting for my entire lifenever had there been so much detailed paid to a vehicle in a game
i mean everysingle aspect was thereeven a car wash
i have no idea how many hours i spent playing that game but took up heaps of my time afterschool
the game was an instant legend and if you didnt own it didnt play it or didnt know someone who had or did you might as well as hung yourself with your sega saturn power chord
the game was just that goodeven to this day i dont think anything has quite impacted or revolutionized racing gamesother than the idea of online game play
but this was the game that gave birth to it all
sure over the years there have been many platform editions of the game but there is only one true gran turismo and thats the original
if your looking for this game today its because you want to add it to your ps collection and this is a game well worth having if you missed out on it
as for me i have my memory cards sitting in the garage just incase someone wants to challenge my dodge viper gtsr one dayi bought this game as i wanted to complete my gt collection
i have been looking for a while to find this game at a reasonable price and amazon didnt let me down in finding it
i have played it and it isnt the best compared to todays standards but i have it more or less to complete the collectionfirst of all i am from guatelama back then in  i was saving to get my nintendo  system
but one day my older brother went to a videogame store planning to by the  with mario
i had already sold my snes and i was just waiting to begin collecting stars
then when my bro came by he was carrying a bag with a playstation box and a rare game called gran turismoi was really mad until he connected it and when the sony logo appeard i was shocked sound graphics etc from the video of gran turismo the presentation to my first race that was it i forgot everything about nintendo except of killer instinct but thats how it startedthe other gran turismos are obviolusly better but this is the one that made the leap
like mgs ffvii and all those awesome ps games that changed how we play right now
gran turismo is that kind of game that not everyone loves specially the arcade ones but its simply amazing
the best of its kind and timeby that time a nfs normaly had no more than    cars and this changed it forever with more than  cars
if you want a realistic experience buy a ps and gran turismo  and after that youll want to have the collection
i have passed the  of them including the prologue it takes time but that why i am payingcharacteristics  cars and customizable first time in history detailed tracksreal phisicsbest racing graphics until gran turismo  and so onmost realistic control untilgt and so on toothe best quaility in menus and a revolutionary simulation mode also an arcade modefirst time ever replays and to save you replay toosimply a classici played this game for the first time some thirteen years ago and i was blown away
in the days of  bit graphics on playstation this was as good as it was going to get for car games
while ea had the arcady need for speed franchise sony and polyphony digitals first foray into simulation racing was absolutely fantastic
as the first entrant into the series that is now up to gt i dont care what the negative reviews say that game is great
 this shines as the title that started it all
i wont go into the nuances of the game here because others have done so before me
if you are chronologically inclined like i tend to be and you want to start the series at its genesis before moving on to the later games there is no better place to start that right here at gt
be forewarned of course that the graphics on your hd tv will be a little lackingok a lot lacking
with all the cars setups tracks and races to make up for it the now suspect graphics wont matter at all
get ready for the first drive of your lifeeffortlessly dusting the competition gran turismo flashes past the finish line with slick controls and stellar gameplay
its easily the best of the playstations realistic racing gamesstarting off in the garage turismo scores big with  reallife cars ranging from the lowly honda civic to the highend dream machines like the corvette viper and toyota castrol supra
the excellent selection of tracks delivers plenty of variety and turismo performs like a winner with no drawin speedy load times and blazingfast action
but gameplay is where turismo really rocks
a fast pickupandplay arcade mode along with topnotch twoplayer splitscreen racing positions turismo at the head of the pack for casual racing fans
and hardcore racers who delve into the amazing sim mode will uncover impressive depth
its almost like fantasy league racingyou test for licenses participate in a wide array of events buy and maintain as many cars as you can afford and even upgrade their performances with a vast multitude of partsneed for speed iii may have more flash but turismos got more game
its one of the mustbuy titles of this summerthis by far one of the best gran turismo on ps driving the skyline with hp wow i still remember my supra back in  on my brothers old ps i used to watch my brother play this game and winning the races and selling cars he would always race on the test track and the ring speedway track i still do it on my ps this is the original that started it all
if you can you past the fact that it is quite dated you will absolutely love everything about this title
the gameplay is rocksolid and the game moves really fast
camera is great as the whole game is viewed from a birds eye perspective
the game is very open ended and you will never get bored while playing thisthe first installment in the gta franchise this game is awsome the story is simple and the gameplay is funi remember when my parents got me this game for christmas  years ago
that was good times
liberty citys based on new york city featuring brocklyn based on brooklyn kings based on queens brix based on bronx manhaddan based on manhattan but no island based on staten island
liberty citys bordered by the garden state of new guernsey based on the garden state of new jersey
very decent graphics by  standards
realistic car controls
realistic gun fights
no so realistic fist fights
good music
there are  more cities to unlock such as the unidentified city in the golden state of san andreas based on san francisco california and vice city in the sunshine state of florida based on miami florda
so get out there grab a car and have some funthis is where it all started
if your and old school gamer youve probably already played this
and if not it is a great game
if your a gta fan but havent played this it is a must to truly understand how great and innovated this series is and has become
if your not a fan of old school gaming though you may not like itthis game has all the violence and language of the current popular grand theft auto games packing into a convenient d packagethis was the first real game i ever played along with the first i ever owned
despite the fact that ive grown out of many kids games and spend my time focused on mrated games with a lot of violence or sexual themes this is one of those games i most definitely have not grown out of
i love the tracks the weapons the charactersyoshis my favorite and simplely how much fun this game still delivers to this very day
the replay value is endless and multiplayer is still very engagingits always fun to humiliate your friends at this game
this game is what got me started on games and it will continue to be one of my most memorable games in my life as a gamerit has spawned such classic levels as i recall such as luigis circuit moo moo farm frappes snowland toads turnpike koopa troopa beach banshee highway bowsers infamous castle warios stadium and the ridiculously long and bright track rainbow road which has spawned at least  different versions throughout the seriesmy alltime favorite level in the game is actually sherbet land
its filled with ice and is just fun to cruise through
and the penguins that you can run into are so cutethe playable characters are your basic eight mario balance luigi balanced princess peach lightweight toad lightweight yoshi advanced donkey kong heavyweight wario heavyweight and bowser the heaviestweightthis game is very very easy to just pick up and play with friends
the controls are simple as all get out and the characters look pretty cool for a n game
the sounds they make are cool tooif you want something that  guys andor girls can enjoy this is the right move
 pros bright colorful boardsaddicting sound effectssemiinteresting charactersfun tracksway battle
nuff said semiunique characters cons sound comes through in player or player mode but fails to when playing with  or  friends levels just isnt enough to satisfy the average gamers thirstthe music can be annoyingnauseating to somewhen youre in st you get crappy items
when youre last you get the best ones usually landing you in stndrdcons aside i spent countless hours with friends that i cherished playing this game
it will bring smiles to your faces for months to come
if you like this and own a nintendo ds or a ds lite shame on all of you who dont
 then i totally recommend mario kart ds also
more levels and more mayhem
did i mention even more characters
 starseven with all the improvements in systems games graphics etc this one remains a classic in all sense of the wordpeople say goldeneye was a much multiplayer than this game but ive spent more happy hours racing my friends in mario kart  than blowing people up with proximity mines in the complex in goldeneyelots of people extol the graphics in goldeneye but graphics in mario kart  is better
first of all it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better
the gameplay is simple but that only means its easier to learn
the card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playingso the characters dont say much
its mainly just a simple quotyippeequot or quotima wario and ima gonna winquot but theres much more ingame speech than goldeneye
sound effects are fine too
the soundtrack is excellent
it ranges from coutry to smooth jazz
even some major critics of video game music i know have said that the music here is great
you know koji kondos doing something right hearing thatmario kart  is addicting with four players and it can be addicting with one player too
the time trials may be a little disappointing but the mario gp had me coming back for morethe game is one of the best racing games on the n
its better than waverace diddy kong racing fzero x and even excitebike  heck its one of the best games on the n
if you havent played this game then you dont know what youre missingthis was the first kart game quite like this there isnt any kart game like this either outside of the mario franchise
if you think you can find a better karting game out there id like to see you find it and show me because from my finds and plays this is the only game that is worth playing
from dk to bowser peach to toad this game has most of the characters that have been involved with mario in some way
the graphics are great for its time the sound is fun the worlds are colorful the idea is great
who wouldnt like this game at any age
im not sure but if you dont you amy need to see a doctor
this is the best kart game ever and the best mario kart game everi have loved this game from day  i was happy to find it and receive it quickly and safelycool gamebut i think toad is the fastest of the crew
i usedto be an expert at iti was even born an expertexcellent game all around except one thingthe game cheatsyou can be in first place and magically all the computer controlled racers somehow manage to catch up to you anywaynow if youre in last place you literally have no chance of catching upnot fairnot coolthat asideif you develop your skills youll still winafter much practice i still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheatsgreat graphicsevery character you love from the mario universei think toad is my favorite when he gets hit lol
the noise he it
makes is hilariousthe courses are inventive and enjoyablethe music fits in perfectlydid i mention it cheatsthats my only complaintotherwise another five star winner from nintendohighly recommendedi used to play this game all the time when i was a kid
i recently came into an n and just had to get it
game works perfectly and it arrived quicklythis is an excellent game
once you start playing you cannot stop until you actually beat it
this has averythingn a good game should have excellent graphics excellent gameplay goodplayer mode and good sound
the only flaw in this game is well their are no flaws this game gets a solid  thanks for reading my review
happy gaming
ps
dont buy pokemon snap thankstruly a classic
this game was one of the first i got for the n and it is one of my favorites today
as it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early n days it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of its era
the sound is moderate but sound isnt a very big facter in deciding the rating of the gamea followup on the early snes version that was also a hit this game was certainly watched before its release date as it stormed into the n world and took many fans as you can see from its very high review in many chances right away
it was considered as a very high class game then and now too
many of the n owners today have one in their hands and many of those have played the game for over  hrsthis game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in
the size of a typical game back then but with the technical advancements of some of the games today
the graphics are very good as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly
the game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time
the sound is entertaining for a while and it is different for almost all of the  courses showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at partsthe gameplay is also great
you may pick one of  characters to race with
on a small go  cart you must race on one of the  courses and try to get in first
there are many modes
you can race with a group of  racers in a grand prix mode where you may race a total of  races and accumulate points
a vs mode race will put you against a friend or  or  in a single race
there is also a battle mode which will put you against  to  other players where the last one alive winsthe items in the game play a big part
some will boost your speed while some are used to slow down enemies
some steal enemies items and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible
most of the however are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down
in battle it will be used as one of  hits to destroy the enemythe characters are the typical mario game characters  mario luigi peach toad yoshi wario dk and bowser
they should all come in handy sometime in the game and it should be fun to test them alloverall this game is great for having fun
i reccommend it to any one
great for technology too
this game is right for youthis is a really cool game
i played this to death i dont know how many times sometimes alone and at times with a partnerits really tragic if you dont have this game when you own an n you dont know what youre  missing out onumwell this game is pretty easy and you dont really  need a strategy guidebook for this one
i think the only reason why its so  damn fun is because on every track and race you can race it differently
you can try new tricks or even attempt to create your own shortcutif you  are that goodgraphicswise its all a letdown i was expecting  realistic models but i got cartoony characters but then again its mario  and friends rightas a mario fan youll want to have this in your  hands and if youre not then play this as a party game
it beats mario  party in replay value but is somewhat less challengingso bottomline  its a little too easy
but that will not prevent it from being a top   game of all time read egm this game is one of two reasons to buy an n
its excellent multiplayer with enough shortcuts and tricks to perfect thats its also a great solo game
if you have an n and you dont have this game then you should stop wasting your time and go out and buy it
you could play the other games but they are terriblethis is the best racing game ive ever played and the most funest
the game has a cool unique to a racing game
it is tons of fun and you can play either mario luigi peach the princess toad yoshi bowserking koopa  donkey kong
there are three types of trophies you can recieve either the mushroom trophy flower trophy star trophy and a special trophy
cool hu
well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone
peace outif you liked this game then check out all of the mario gamesit plays great and i look forward to beating my fance
we place bets on who will win and the looser has to do the choresmario kart  is by far the best n gameif you want nonviolent racing with all the nintendo characters for a good price look no furtheralso if you like mario kart  you might likemario kart dsmario kart super curcuitmario kart snesmario kart  the sequel to the first mario kart game on the snes is great
nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the snes title so much fun but added a lot too
the gameplay is much more enhanced the characters look much better and the individual gokarts are very realisticlike the snes version this game includes  modes of play gp grand prix battle and time trial
in gp you choose one of  characters mario luigi peach toad wario yoshi donkey kong and bowser in a large variety of courses in the mushroom cup flower cup star cup or special cup which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the  basic courses in cc cc or cc mode
cc is the easiest but in cc and cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging
there are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race
lightning bolts the rarest item to get makes all of the other opponents small mushrooms give you a speed burst banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers
unlike the snes mairo kart game there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course
in different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them snowmen that will blow up if you hit them and many other obstacles in different coursesin battle mode you and up to  others choose one of the  characters
you drive around a course trying to pop each others  balloons
you can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip
you can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them
once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players
this mode is a lot of fun especially if you get tired of continually playing grand prix modein time trial mode you race in any of  courses and try to set records for each lap andor racethe controls for mario kart  are very simple and easy to master and the music and sound effects are great as wellif you want a great racing game for your n i highly recommend that you check out mario kart its a classic anyone that has a n should have this gameclassic racing game
if you love racing games you should consider getting this game
you race around tracks throwing random stuff so that you can win
the graphics are great i mean during that time the graphics are great you cant really argue about thatafter checking gamespots authors note this was originally posted exclusively on gamespotcom and a few user reviews i absolutely had to throw my two cents in
i couldnt help but laugh when i read the introduction of even with all its bells and whistles mario kart  is very likely to disappoint you after about a week
when i picked up this game initially my thoughts were sweet
a new super mario kart
i unfortunately never had an snes of my own so my fixes came in the form of time at my friends housethis game is absolutely spectacular in every way
yes i do feel that it could benefit from maybe a higher difficulty level and there is also the fact that its possible to clinch a gold medal in a circuit  races after finishing in the top spot in each of the first three races
however other than these minor spots i find it to be flawless
everything from the graphics to the sound to the features are great
there is also a great amount of multiplayer available in this with not only the up to four player splitscreen but the track ghosts as well
track ghosts are saved data of your best race single player only on a course
the game saves not only your time but your entire race
when you race against your ghost you can actually compare yourself secondbysecond on the tracks and this also helps you to analyze spots and what you did to help you become a better racerthe items are what really make multiplayer fun though
ive had many a time where i have something such as a ghost which lets you steal and item and makes you invisibleinvincible while my friend had a lightning bolt shrinks all opponents and its a quick reaction race to see who can get their item deployed first
to me however there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent especially if its a friend instead of the computer with a green shell a shell that fires straight out as opposed to the red homing shells as hes about to cross the finish line to win not just the race but the circuit as well
and yes i actually did that to a friend of mine
talk about bragging rightsup to this point i have kept or at least tried to keep retrorating out of this review and i was considering dropping one of the five rankings to a  because im stingy with giving out perfect s
if i had rated this game when it first came out it would probably be rated somewhere around  to  however there is one reason and one reason only that i still own my n  and that is to play mario kart   a decade later
note i cant even say that about zelda oot or goldeneye
that in itself i think warrants the move up to the perfect  rating
 i guess this pretty much means that ill have to give super mario kart a  as well
i guess well see when i finally get it on virtual console
for those of you who ask virtual console
why read paragraph 
overall gameplay graphics sound value tilt i bought mario kart  for my nephew for his birthday
i played mario kart  when i was a little and i loved it
my nephew already has mario kart ds and he loves it
i figure that he will love this game too
mario kart  has many different levels in which you can race other mario characters such as luigi wario donkey kong bowser and many others
i would recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the newer mario kart gamesthis game is an old racing game but heckits better then half of them out nowwith all the crazy weaponsit can keep you goin awilethis game is really worth it if u have a nintendo this is still  of my favorite gamesmario kart  this game is fun youll play this over and over
my favorite board is mushroom  level its easy thats why and you pick up items to used from keeping your opponent from taking the lead
great buythis game was shipped quickly and was in very good condition
i have great memories of playing this game when i was young and now my son and i can make new memories
thanks very muchmy favorite part of this game is the battle mode
my friend showed me all the tricks he has learned from playing it
like where to set traps and other stuff
the one player mode is fun toomario kart on the n is an extremly well made game
when one person plays the game for the first time the controls are easy and you dont nead to worry about changing gears
after you get better you can move on to harder levels of play
once you beat the game on cc hardest level you can race al track in mirror mode all tracks have opposite turns then their original tracks
the ads more replay value because the game in a sence has new tracks
all the tracks are unique and have varied difficulty levels
they are also well designedthe graphics in mario kart are bright simple and full of color
the music in the game is not very good but it does not mater because of the great sound effects provided by the charactersas with all great n games this one accells in the multiplayer department
it will appeal to people of all ages
you can choose from  different multiplayer modes battle championship single race
the most fun out of all of those is batlle because you go around getting items then try to hit your friends with any item you get
if you hit youre oponent theyll lose a balloon they have  ballonsthis is a party game i would recommend over any mario party game and definitly over didy kong racing
this is a classic n game no one shoild be withouti love all the mario kart games this one has some of the coolest tracks
yoshi valley is the best track ive ever played and the graphics are pretty good too
small selection of characters if youve got the one for gamecube but still a blast
awesome  player or multiplayer game a must have for parties
good anytime and thats hard to findthis mario kart is my favorite of any in the series and i am so glad i bought it because i have had so much funthis game i grew up with and enjoy very much
i have been playing this game since i was  or  years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new
what i have is a like new version but unforutantely i lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe i will find it one day while i shop around the internet
i love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the likethe price was reasonable and the game shipped relatively quickly
most importantly it works
what else could you ask formario kart is definetly the most classical game ever for racing
but maybe even the most classical game nintendo has ever madethis game has three different levels
one is data which keeps track of your best time for the particular track and you get three mushroom guys who give you a boost up forward but there are no diamonds to get a specialty like a star or something
ill explain about the special items later so you know what there for before you might play the gamein options you can see your data records for each track showing the best lap and the top  races in time with the particular racer on itnot names instead they show
mario peach bowser wario yoshi dk luigi and my personal favorite which is toad only do for one playeranother one of the things you can do in mario kart is do mario kart gp where you compete with all the other racers while picking your own
before you start the screen will show  different brackets which have  tracks each and you pick the bracket you want
after each race itll show the score of each racer in points which goes that if you place th through th you get no points
th gets  rd gets  nd gets  and st gets  at the end of the of all the races the top three racers will stand on that olympic where it says and  ranging as  the highest and  the lowest
after it shows the three racers om each of their spots it will show a trophy to you in bronze silver or gold and then  your player says something like yeah
oh yeah their are diamonds in this modethen their is a single game which you only play one game against the computer or against friends at any course you or your friend wants to play atfinally which you mightve been waiting to hear is about the freaking diamonds
while your racing their will be diamonds around and if you go through one it will show a box showing which specialty youve gotten
the long list of specialties are one red shell which if you throw at someone within a certain distance they will fly up and back down making you get ahead
also theres a  red shell specialty where it shows three red shells going around your car and it does the same thing as  red shell would do
the green shells are totally opposite from the red one it comes in threes and ones and when you throw it will just bounce off the sides of the course back and forth going preety slow but preety much the only way you can hit another player with a green shell is if the racer is almost or is right in front of you
but the bowser shell which you dont get often but if you do get it you can throw it from anywhere and it will get the closest player ahead of you but if your in first place the shell is worthless
also preety much everybodys favorite specialty is the star where you can go really fast to catch up for about  seconds and if your it by anything itll just back off of you and you will stay up because you can do that the game also lets you knock people over if you headed straight at them and bumped them
sorry if this is boring but if you want to hear about the game and you will buy it you should listen to the rest
you get bananas in s and s
bananas you just drop on the ground and racers might crash into them and start slipping on the floor
the last specialty is ghost where nobody can see you and if a specialty hits you you will just keep one goingmy favorite mode is battle where you have to have  or more players
in battle their are  different modes
during battle you have  ballons with diamonds on the ground when you get hit you lose a ballon and when you have lost all three ballons you become a bomb to go get other players
as a bomb you cant get any specialties but if you bump in to any racers you will be done as a bomb but that racer will lose a ballon
by the way computers can not play in this modethis should be enough to know how this game is and i hope that you buy this game because you will probably like itthis game is a classic which ive said beforeps good bye and have a nice dayprobably a top three game as far as popularity is concerned on the n
just a simple racing game with the original mario cast but a game that was a lot of fun
multiplayer mode was even better as it made for real good fun competition amongst friends
truly a classic game that is a must for n collectionthe original mario kart for the snes was fun and a good effort for the limited capabilities of the snes platform
mario kart  made full use of the ns d capabilities making for a very fun and successful game
up to four players can engage in the game and the racecourses are as colorful and rich as they are varied
each character has their own racecourse peachs castle bowsers castle yoshis canyons donkey kongs jungle and so on and so forth plus more that are just fun and varied like a beach the desert snowfields and the rainbow roadyou can play against the computer and compete for various cups and each set of courses has various levels of difficulty
you get cool items to aid your progress on the track or hinder the progress of others there is also a vs mode where two to four players can battle against one another
overall this is a really great game for the nintendo i remember i was  and i had just gotten a nintendo  at such a young age most of the games out were too complicated for me and i had to find something i could understand
enter mario kart  this game is pure and simple you pick a character and race with seven other famous nintendo stars in  detailed for n anyway stages
this was one of the ns first games so for me it turned the system into a classic which i still play todaythis game was much better than super mario kart and much better than double dash
in this game you can choose from cc  cc which isnt much and depending on your speed this could be very boring or the ride of your life
i mean seriously who wouldnt want to speed down yoshi valley at  mph
for its time in  this game was amazing and i still play it today
i am  now so it has an enormous replay value
and the only stage i dont like is banshee boardwalkif you have a nintendo  which not many people do then buy this nowthis is one of the best games out for the n
the races and tournaments themselves are challenging and extremely fun
the many characters that you can unlock all have their own abilities and everything else to set them aside
the tracks are not repetitive and give each race a fresh new layer of funmultiplayer is an even better experiencewho could imagine that battles with cars and turtle shells would actually be fun
well it is fun and will keep you playing for hours on end
this game will make your friends ask if they can come over and play
a sure hit with a gamer of any agefor nintendo some of their most popular games have been revised over and over again
in the case of the nintendo  the case has happened to itself too
the  mario kart  game is no acception
the starting flag proves that the light is worth checking outin this game you play any of eight characters in  traditional courses and  battle zones
choose from mario yoshi wario peach luigi toad donkey kong and bowser
the graphics are a bit more intact than the other racing games that came later for the system
although it might try to drown you out a little bit at a time when you complete the four racing cups quickly
luckily the game truly makes up for it in the vs mode where you are headtohead n a battle with up to four players in the racemario kart is absolutely worth checking out for the nintendo  despite the fact the nintendo  has no more new games for the system
if you buy it only for yourself your better off bringing in a partner for the ridethis is my favorite of the series
my cousin and i used to play it all the time and it is how i remember
hit detection is a little offlike many other people i absolutely adore racing games and the mario games
then i saw this come out
it was perfect
it was a racing game with the characters from the super mario series
i was so excited to play it
my friends and i played it all night
it was so addicting
in fact i still play this game todaymario kart  is an excellent game
i love the graphics the creators at nintendo  made them very specific
my favorite modes to play in are either mario gp because i love racing against the computer or battle because you have to be alert and careful not to run into in obstacles like bananas or shells
i really like the quotghostquot so you can see whether or not you beat your previous time with that course
my favorite course is yoshi valley because in many areas there are no walls to keep you from falling so its a challenge and i like the big squasher egg
the one thing that drives me crazy is the fact that the computer can manage to get in front of me while racing without me noticing or even knowing how they did it
other than that this is a great game with excellent graphics and fun for the whole family
i hope you enjoyed my reviewif you liked mario kart for the super nintendo then you will love mario kart this is an amazing game
one of the best for the  if you have competition around you can take up hours of play timei have played this game almost as much as i have golden eye  but not quite as much
if you are looking for a good quality game with a very high replay value then this is a great game to check outdoesnt matter if you are  or  you can get into this game
the multiplayer makes things a little bit more interesting
the battle mode is the best feature if you have equal level competitionif you like racing games that are unique this is for you
you can race by yourself or with a friend
not only that but you can also challenge your friends in battle mode with some really fun arenas
if your more of a solo player like me dont worry there are four different tournaments that you can playyou can even use different items either to slow down the other racers or to help you pass them up
of course every item has its own effects there are a few that are hard to get
thats because theyre special learn how to use them and the competition will be eating your dustand last but far from least there is a special mode you can unlock for an even bigger challenge
yeah this game will keep you busy no matter how you play
its definately a musthave order it while you canmario kart  is without a doubt one of the best games ever made for the nintendo  or any other system
even today  years after its original release mario kart  is still amazingly fun
the controls are perfect and i do mean perfect
the first time you go power sliding around a sharp turn youll see what i mean
the game is perfectly balanced each character has strengths and weaknesses
your skill determines if you come in first not because you picked the best character
oh and i havent even spoken about the brilliant course design
every course has shortcuts and special features making them truely unique
the placement of the powerups is wonderful
and the multiplayer oh the multiplayer
one word brilliant
playing with your friends is exciting competetive and will have you laughing like crazy
this is what multiplayer gaming is all about
if the game does have one weakness it is the graphics being  years old mario kart  doesnt stack up well against todays crop of games in terms of visuals
but when youre having this much fun with a game do the graphics matter
no way
even if you own the gamecube version of mario kart you still owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this timeless classici use to love this game and after purchasing this one i found i still do
the game was of quality and is still working just finemario kart  is the true d nintendo  sequel to super mario kart
since the characters wouldnt look so great on karts in d on the n the sprites are in d which explains how they are fully detailedthere are  courses you can race in along with  courses for your average battle modenow that there are  players the  player modes can be pretty fun especially player since it has all the options from player modethe item roster is slightly different from super mario kart but its fun to use them alloverall mario kart  is another game that defines d gaming on the nintendo i love this game this is the coolest game ever brings back great memories from my childhood playing this game it never gets old to playmario kart is one of the more entertaining video games of all times
it is suitable for all ages and can be enjoyed and mastered by the young and old
player simultaneous play with a selection of  classic mario characters and  different difficulties beat all curcuits in rd or better to earn extra mode and  levels of play each level containing its own unique obstacles and coursethis game is pretty darn easy
i beat most of the tracks with only a rental
its not near as tough as the snes version
heck the snes version of rainbow road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot
rainbow road is a cakewalk on this one
wide the whole way with walls all around
too darn easy
however there is a monster shortcut thats very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interestingeven though it was too easy i bought the game anyway
its fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers
plus i really like the games endingthere is one hard level the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode
it can be very frustrating if you make a mistake because you get run over again and again and again
it usually takes away any hope of recoverythe most significant improvement over the snes version is the time trial mode
you can race a ghost of yourself after youve already completed the course
the ghost is only a recording of your previous performance but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time i assure youive never been into multiplayer modes but if youre into that kind of thing youll really love this game
some multiplayer matches can go on for a long time since the levels are so welldesignedanyone who owns a nintendo  and does not own mario kart should just throw it awaythis is a classic n game thats a ton of funeven today where there are games with better graphicsthe point of the game is simple win the race by any meansthere are no plot twists no complicated storylinesit has all the classic mario characters includingmario luigi peach bowser wario toad yoshi and othersonce you finish everything there is a bonus optionwhere you can play all levels again but backwardsseriously this game is an awesome classicand a great addition to any and all n game collectionsoverallthis has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the nintendo  this kind of game is great for all ages
im  years old and my friends and i still to this day continue to play mario kart
it is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours
you can play it by yourself but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others
there is really no story line to the game just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with
if you get bored of racing over and over again there are several mini games known as battle games to choose from
honestly i like playing the battle games more than i like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family
so overall i would definitely say get this game if you dont have it
it is a must buy for avid nintendo  usersthis is one of the best star wars  n games they have made i say if you have a n get this game
need i say morei picked this up in a pack of two other n games for five dollars at a used game store
now usually those bundle deals have all of the mediocre n games in them that no one wants to buy individually
however star wars rogue squadron is easily one of the best n games ive ever playedstory the game appears to take place between a new hope and the empire strikes back in the star wars universe
youre luke skywalker the original trilogys protagonist and a fighter pilot for the rebel alliance
youll help people with vital intelligence defect from the empire protect rebelallied cities and of course fight the empiregameplay unfortunately you never get to wield a light saber or anything
thats not what this game is about
its a spaceshooter
you travel to different planets in your xwing or  one of the other rebel spaceships and do missionssound there may be an n game with more audio than rogue squadron but ive never played it if so and ive played entirely too many of them p
theres so much voiceacting
theres lengthy descriptions of every ship in the rebel fleet backstories for rogue squadrons fighter pilots and of course inlevel communication between the pilotsgraphics its a very nice job by factor  here
of course it looks dated by now but in the grand scheme of things id say its aged pretty gracefully
make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effectreplay value you get medals for doing well enough in every stage
im told that if you get medals in every stage you can unlock secret missions like the battle of hoth from empire strikes back and the death star run
if thats not incentive to beat this game  what isits clearly a classic n game worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as goldeneye and ocarina of time
id only that having a decent n analog helps a lot
if your controllers analog is dying due to wear and tear youll have a hard time towards the end of the gamei have got to be honest even if it means sacking my reputation
i have never played a game so much before in my life
i only own the n still for this game i have thrown out all others
this game brings such a movie like experience along with great missions craft and imperial action that i have never seen anything to its likeness
you have got to get this game under all circumstances if you are a star wars fanoriginally playing rogue leader star wars rogue squadron  its great to get back to the keystone that started the whole franchise
while not allowing for some of the more advanced gameplay from future games this product is and was fantastic for the age of n era gaming
a much needed classic to add to the collection for surefor the n this game is really fun graphics are amazing sound quality is alright
if you love flight simulation games then this is definitely for you
you are luke skywalker flying around on various fun missions
there are tons of unlockable cheats that can be added for a better funfilled experience
get the expansion pack which is cheap nowadaysthis has to be one of the best star wars games ever made
its on par with jedi knightdark forces  and knights of the old republic
its one of the first games to nail the dog fights from the st star wars films
the controls are great and its easy to get used to
it shows off planets that are both new and familer from the films like hoth
if your a star wars nut like me get itwell im going to have to agree with darth vader on the strong part
but as for the force part im nonchalant
star wars rogue squadron begins somewhere in between star wars episode iv and episode vi
let me just say youll be visiting place in the star wars universe and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies which is good with me
the graphics in the game are some of the best youll ever see on the n
the music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done
this is i would say the best star wars rogue squadron game ever made
oh and by the way yes i have played star wars rogue squadron rogue leader
i fully recommend this game
and thats my review
remember be a customer
not a consumer
period jake smithersthis game is great for star wars fans
there are eleven single missions but there are three bonus missions too
the first is a race on tatooine where you fly a t skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates
the second is the death star trench run which the developers in my opinion over did because the trence is huge and it has to many turns
the best bonus level is the battle of hoth
the graphics and music are superd just like every other lucasarts and factor five  game
their are also secret vehicles
you can pilot the naboo starfighter by using a secret code go to lucasarts website
the millunium falcon and the tie interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals
it doesnt take long to beat this game if your good at games like this but ot does offer a pretty good challenge
now go join the rebellion and vaporize those tie fightersthank you for this gamemy nephews keep playing this game they say that it is so much fun they keep fighting to see who is going to win the game
thank you so muchrogue squadron
every star wars fan knows the elite starfighter group of pilots
now you get the opportunity to experience what it feels like to hop into the cockpit of an xwingywingawing vwing millenium falcon tie
interceptor and the naboo starfighter
as you fly through over  missions ranging from tatooine to mon calamari youll earn ranks in the squardronltthe highest ive gotten is gold leadergt
with each mission you complete youll earn a medalltbronze silver or goldgtand be promoted
do you have what it takes to buy this game and prove youve got what it takes to be a top fighter pilotstar wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n game ever made get this game even if youre not a star wars fan you wont regret iti loved this game when i first played it i still play it even today the graphics where awsome the sound was cool the levels where all kinds of stratageys and the expansion pack worked great with it
the cheats to fly the falcon tie fighters naboo fighter ect all made the game even better
there is even a secret little mini game where you can control a chicken walker atst and shoot up some droids and buildings in a small spacethe only downfall is there is no way to get unlimited heat seeker rockets so you have to turn on your unlimited lives cheat and keep commiting suicide to get more of those rockets to win within the selected times to get the gold medal to become a jedi
and there is no nice videos to watch when you finally clock the game
it just shows a quick shot of the ships flying away and then the credits roll it would be nice to have had a video type of thing like all through the gameapart from that this game rocked my the shwartz be with youwhen the n system first kicked off one of its first titles was star wars shadows of the empire
shadows was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on
it had challenging yet rewarding levels and overall solid gameplay
however it had two marks against it
the first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the n and resembled supernes games on certain boards
the second is that except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again shadows lacks any real replay value
the introduction of star wars rogue squadron based on a series of very successful novels to the n environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for actionadventure games on any platform
rogue squadron focuses on the missions of the famed rogue squadron thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy
led by the legendary wedge antilles the squadron fights  regular missions and  bonus missions ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of kessel to battling the terrifying world devastators on mon calamari
that just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place
the graphic environment is much more advanced this time around
no more static matte backgrounds
everything is fluid and moves with the player
the gameplay has also been enhanced
greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships
overall it makes for a spectacular gaming experience
rogue squadron also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability
it awards medals bronze silver gold for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency
achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions
this creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been metthere is only one minor quibble about rogue squadron
in the game designers quest to make a very demanding game they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill
the most glaring example of this is the level raid on sullust
flying as a supposedly heavily armored ywing one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission
however the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the  targets that must be hit
with skillful flying it may be possible to knockout  or  of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying but on the life its likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than  seconds
with only  ships per mission its impossible to defeat that mission without using the unlimited lives cheat code which will not be revealed here
however theres no shame in using that code and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals
so its a minor annoyance
rogue squadron raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for actionadventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet
nintendo still gets it though as it followed this game with the even more successful rogue leader for gamecube
rogue squadron is a must have for any serious gamers libraryif i had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing
quotrogue squadronquot pushes the n to its maximum power graphically which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack i strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother
the gameplay couldnt be more entertaining i often wonder how my little nintendo  is able to handle all that this game has to offer
the missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous imperial ships
the ai is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it
environments in this game are incredible for a nintendo  game and i give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them
cant get youre hands on the new rogue squadron quotrogue leaderquot for gamecube
pick this up to satisfy youre urge if you do own rogue leader or even dont plan on getting it pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experiencelucasarts has really outdone itself with this great n game
after shadows of the empire was released it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level where you are flying a rebel airspeeder during the battle of hoth
la decided to make a whole game using a similar concept and rogue squadron was born
you play as luke skywalker leader of rogue squadron a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy making life difficult for the empire and its minions
you play through  basic missions which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of rogue squadron during the time between the destruction of the first death star and the empire strikes back
the missions range from simple searchanddestroy missions to escorting supply trains to freeing rebel soldiers from imperial prison facilities
along the way you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft from the xwing to the airspeeder
each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses plus each craft has a special weapon which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions
after you complete each mission you may be awarded a bronze silver or gold medal based on your performance
after completing a mission you can move on to the next one or else go back and try again to get a better score
the game gives you a score summary after each mission so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the goldthe look and feel of the game is excellent
the graphics are superb and the expansion pak boosts them to cinematic levels
the sound is also excellent for a noncd game although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive
the game is contained within a d environment giving the game a flight simulatorlike feel
the controls are pretty easy to get used to though this does take a little practice
fortunately the first couple of missions are pretty easy so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls
the controls are the same for each ship so you dont have to switch back and forthas stated before the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy
but starting with about the fourth mission they start to get really tough with multitudes of tie fighters missile turrets and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down
expect to die many times before mastering each mission
getting the gold medal on all  missions will definitely take a whilethe game has a lot of nice bonus features as well
as you complete missions and earn higher medals three bonus missions will appear plus you will gain access to new ships including the millenium falcon and a captured imperial tie interceptor
there is also a passcode screen allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options including a fourth bonus level and the naboo starfighter
there is even a code to allow you to fly a buick sedan against the empire
the codes themselves are pretty easy to get
there are several sites on the internet that have themits easy to get immersed in the d environment of this game
manys the time ive found myself leaning over to the left or right as i put my xwing through a tight turn
for those who like flight simulatortype games i would say that this is the best fs game on the n
its a bit dated now what with the impending release of rogue squadron ii for the gamecube but for those n fans out there this one is a musthaveocarina of time is the best video game of the last  yearsif you have never played it your missing out
plus you are a toolthe first zelda game for the  the legend of zelda ocarina of time won game of the year for   as link your quest to save the triforce from the evil ganondorf will take you all over hyrule not only in the present but also the future with the help of the ocarina of time
if you like the zelda series this game is definently for you or even if you just like to save the world in your spare timei love this game
i love this game
i love this game
i just got ocarina of time and its been a few years since it has come out  it still rocks even in comparison to whats out now
ive had a playstation  for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there but after playing ocarina of time i realize that i had forgotten the beauty of nintendo games
they just have a special feel to them and they make me remember the years that i was a little tike playing old nintendo games
i just beat the game about  minutes ago
i certainly wont spoil anything but i will tell you that the ending is over  seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see  a video game hasnt brought me this level of satisfaction in a while
bravo nintendo bravoi just bought this game a few weeks agoand its awesome
it just has that this is going to be an epic game from the get go
it has great graphicseven to this dayfirst of allthis is an action adventurenot a rpgrole playing gamenexti recommend buying the strategy guide
this game is what gamers call nintendo hard
its a challenging gamewith quite a number of puzzle partsanywaybuy it if you have a or virtual console it if you have a wiithis game is blew me away
i didnt expect ocarina to meet with my standards after playing the previous zelda games
they usually go stale and predictable but ocarina didnt do that
its a game for true fans of the adventure genre
the dungeons are long and perilous there are numerous sidequests a great cast of characters and a large world to travel
if you have any doubts about this game eliminate them
you wont be dissapointedthis could be the best game of all time
what else needs to be said
if you havent played this game before and still have a working n you need to pickup this game
if you havent played the game you can also find it on the wii virtual console and an upcoming remake for dsim what gamers call a zelda veteran  ive played almost all of the zelda games and managed to beat only one this one
i love the zelda games because they are challenging different and fun to playin this one link lives in a forest with the forest folk
link is soon inside the deku tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree
after a battle with the queen spider the deku tree sadly dies and tells link to find zelda the princess of hyrulehyrule is a kingdom thats always in trouble and its up to link to save the land from a terrible enemy
link has the help of navi a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do nextduring his adventures link will learn spells be swallowed by a huge fish and saving the land from the evil ganondorf
this game is a classic and worth the moneyfor all those of you that have followed the lineage of zelda from its early days on the classic bit system and onward to its snes days with quota link to the pastquot great game and loved every second of it then you have to buy this game
for those of you that have never played any other zelda game what are you waiting for
now is a great time to startocarina of time is amazing
all the elements of classic zelda are there  dozens of powerful items and weapons lots of secrets to find at least  new drendered challenging dungeons plenty of secrets and sidegames and something that all the other zeldas never had a truly great storyif you enjoyed quota link to the pastquot you will most certainly like this game as well
the story of ocarina of time involves going back and forth in time between a happy peaceful hyrule and a dark evil one much like alttp but dont think this is a ripoff on its predecessor
the complex dungeons challenging bosses and deepening story lines will blow you away
the d element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before
even the music is catchy and well orchestrated
i actually downloaded the mp soundtrack online
the gameplay is a little tough to get used to  afterall youve never played zelda in d before  so you actually have to consider things sneaking up behind you and flying overhead
but once you get used to the controls and learn to use the quotztargetingquot feature using the trigger button will solve just about any control problem you may encounter the gameplay gets easierthe only thing that annoyed me was navi a little fairy that travels with link throughout the game
she is always bugging you to give you painfully obvious information
i suppose she is a helpful guide for younger or more inexperienced players but i found her annoying
but once you come to realize that navi is an important aspect of the games control you will let it slidei would recommend this game to anyone who owns an n console and even more so if you enjoyed sness quota link to the pastquot i cant wait to play the sequel when it comes outreally though could an old out dated game still be awesome  years later
the answer is yes because this game is just too good
it gives you a complete story on hyrule and the triforce not to mention the best video game music ever especially the boss music
being able to play as young link and adult link in two similar yet in a way completely different worlds as one would find out sooner or later
the graphics are still and when this was released it was the best game graphicwise as well
the bosses are easy yet in a way challenging and the dungeons and temples are amazingly designed
however there are two faults one minor one somewhat majorlink is missing the strap on his frontside that holds his sword case thingy
well it just kinda looks oddthe quotfinal bossquot is far too easybut dont be too sure of thatbefore i played this game the only other zelda game that i had ever played was link to the past and i couldnt understand it that well
i decided to play this because of the hype
i was sure glad i did
this is one of the best games ever
its full of adventure it has a wonderful story and it is challenging
it begins with link a yearold kokiri child of the forest who is chosen to save hyrule his home world
along the way you meet new friends such as princess zelda and grow into a yearold adult to fight the evil ganondorf
you have many different weapons spells and items at your disposal including swords bows and a giant hammer
the fun never stops and the story never goes flat
if you want a grand adventure buy this game
if you like this play the legend of zelda majoras mask but wait until you finish this gamevery fun game to play and has an excellent story line to play
lots of different equipment to use and the game isnt overly difficult to beatill make it shorti hopeim not particular a fantasy lover i never read tolkiens lord of the ring i hate the lord of the ringmovies and was insulted by the numerous oscars the films receivedi despise the star wars movies especially the return of the jedi which has that peculiar fantasyfeel in itblahdieblahblahnow with games its a different story i dont know why but im much more forgiving and willing to accept a world where fairies gnomes and other creatures excistthe ocarina of time is one of few artistic highlights i encountered in my lifeits almost ridiculous when i think about what ive just wrote what about literature art and cinemathis game moved me so mucham i a geektheres so much depth in this piece of artit isnt the story alone cmon lets be honest its an average fantasy tale if made into a movie id fall asleep after  minutesi think its all the pieces put together a beautiful crafted world the progress when playing  from a child into a young man  the challenges youll face and overcome the music that playes a big role in the game the use of time day and night future and past etc
etcit grabs you and most important its interactive duh for its a game youre not watching a crap fantasy movie but playing the hero all by yourself when he looses you loose etci played a lot of games in my life including many newer titles as halo gta metroid prime etc etc and i didnt yet played a game that matched the sheer brilliance of the legend of zelda  the ocarina of timebest game ever so fari was worried about getting this but i did anyways because i have been after it for a long time
i was worried because it was usedacceptable but it has played great so far though i havent gotten very far yet so so far i am so glad i went ahead and ordered iti have played all the other zelda series games and this is the best
i first heard of this game when i borrowed it from a friend
i played it nonstop until i beat the game
the only hard part about it is the dreaded water temple
it is the only actual hard one but dont get me wrong the rest of the dungeons are equally difficult
even the first level is as difficult because you have only your sword shield and wits
but as you progress you gain pieces of hearts weapons swords shields and other tools
the graphics are really cool the sound could be just a tad better and the fun is the best
the only bad part is you cant unfreeze zoras domain and get the triforce or miyamoto says
well if you liked the other zelda games this is a must have
if you never have played a zelda game get a lifequite possibly if you dont know why then you havent played many videogames in its tenure the n had its share of bad games
with exceptions like super mario  the thq wrestling games and a few others it seemed like the bad outweighed the good
but with ocarina of time the balance took a drastic shift as n was given its best overall game
ocarina of time has many strong points for itself
for one the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake
the game plays across a vast world with different subsections each with their own particular themes
the gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game
graphics and sounds are done extremely well considering the cartridge space allowedthere is not much to complain about as this game really showed players what the n was capable of
its unfortunate that other game publishers didnt work this hard
but then again quotocarinaquot is a tough act to followthis is one of the best and my personal favorites from the zelda franchise
the story was fantastic the gameplay was amazing for the time even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitchesthere was hardly any serious problems with this game
the playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do
each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy
some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating itpuzzles in this game were i suppose challenging for  child but they were not impossible
this is a great game for all ages and a great buy as wellthis game is defently one of my top favorite games
i dont have it but ive rented it and it is cool
your constantly under presure and near the end it feels like theres no where to go
in this game you shoot arrowsfight theifsget a horseventure in caves and much more challenges like deafeating the power hungry sorcerer gannondorf
deffently  stars
im planing on buying this game todaythis zelda game is simply amazing
the wind waker sucked and four swords was ok but this game rocks
the main plot was spectacular and the gameplay was great
i first played the game after getting collectors edition for christmas and i was addicted to it
the main plot throughout the whole game is that linkas a kid must collect  spiritual stones and open the door of time along with the ocarina of time
as an adult link must awaken the  sages and fight to destroy the evil ganondorf and rescue zelda
i have beaten the game  times it was so good
i highly recommend it to big zelda fans
note this game has a sequel called majoras mask but its not near as good in my opinionwhat else is there to say
this is the best game i have every played
totally worth a replay
the game was in great condition and got to me quicklythe best n game
its easy difficult to totally master and is fun to play again and again
the bosses are creative and original and the dungeons are fun and easy
storyline is pretty good better than the quotsave the princessquot generalization its often given
the characters are a quiet hero of time an eternally youthful forest girl a wild rock man from the firey death mountain a rebellious fish woman a determined royal guard a sexy thief the quotprincessquot and of coure ganon the bad guylove this game
although the graphics arent the best since its n and earlier on i enjoy everything about it still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the invisible walls and oddly prism shaped bottles etc
the story is well done and unlike other zelda games all of the items are used
there were some early on copies with a songchanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield i have one such copy but even with that in mind its still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub
it all comes down to this game definitely worth your time to playwhat can i possibly say about this game that hasnt been said a million timesperfectiongroundbreakingbeautifuljust some of the words that come to mind when i think of zelda zelda was my introduction to rpgs and what an introduction it wasthe goodeverythinggraphics story pacing etcinsanely difficult in parts i still cant beat the water temple without the walk throughand ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all timethe badnothingone of the games that not only defined the n but a game that set the standard for excellence in rpgsone of the besteverhighest recommendationswhat can i say about this game
i bought it to replace one that was stolen when i was a kid
its great to hear those classic sound effects and that legendary music
epicthis game is the best game on my n next to nightmare creatures this game feels like final fantasy with kingdom hearts it was the best selling game on the n
if you still have one you should pick this one upits ocarina of time
i just wanted to get it for my fiancee for christmas because she loves the gamewhat can be said about ocarina of time
i still remember that commercial from the late s
it told us that a dark time is approaching
my interest was piqued
then i realized it was a zelda game
as a huge fan of a link to the past i thought zomg that looks awesome
i need to get this more than ive ever needed to get anything
i remember reading about it in gamepro and obviously being interested but that commercial sealed the deal
i knew i had to have ocarina of time and that christmas my mom got it for me
cheersa lot has been said about oot over the years
it has been referred to as the best game of all time by some and the most overrated game of all time by others
im not really in either camp but i lean closer to the former group i suppose
if you havent played it yet you should
its out on a variety of platforms and theres even remake of it with better graphics but i would still recommend the n version if you want the same experience people had back in the s when oot was the game you needed to playstoryyou are link
the great deku tree guardian of the forest in which you live has summoned you
its revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a princess of destiny and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of hyrule  nay the world  itselfgameplayto complete your quest and save hyrule you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors humansized spiders horrible ghosts and immobile venus fly traps
completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss
theres much more to it that but im trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who havent played ithyrule is a vast world
one of your ingame guides tells you that you can go wherever you want
thats true to a point
theres a lot of exploration in ocarina of time
the game is always trying to point you toward a certain place but whether or not you go there is often up to you
in an interactive world such as hyrule you can do many things
why go see whats on death mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in hyrule
or why go play the shadow temple  which does not have any attractive gerudo women  when you could go to the spirit temple which does
the exploration is one of oots best features and its probably better than any zelda which came after itcontrolsthey work well enough
you dont have the full on camera control that some of the later zelda games give you but personally i never found it all that essential to the processocarina of time introduced a ztargeting system for aiming at enemies and talking to nonplayable characters
what you do is get near an enemynpc press or hold z and then press a button to talk to themattack them
the system pretty intuitive and well made so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon itmusics gripe where is the classic zelda overworld theme
oh we can hear it for like five seconds in the hyrule field theme
are you serious
but seriously the music is pretty good
the hyrule field theme which i just mentioned is a good theme
the music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit for the most partsome later zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons
oot is guilty of this too but only to a small degree
apart from the water temples melody theres nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it
poh and im sad to report that the oot commercial music is not in this game replay valueits pretty massive
you can do some temples in different orders than you did your first time through or you can use different items to progress through the temples
i summed it up in a sentence but theres hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of oots possible variationslike in the original legend of zelda you can do the three heart challenge which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon
essentially thats playing hard mode although it isnt really that hardbut if the three heart challenge wasnt enough oot lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder
there are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat
not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas
on top of all that you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damageif you call yourself a gamer and have not played ocarina of time what are you
some undercover nongamer sent in to infiltrate us
go play it nowthis is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got  hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game great music better then zelda  for the n this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n game lovers u will want this master game for your systemone of the best video games everredefined everything after itmy copy came in very good condition without scratches or writingthe legend of zelda ocarina of time is the best zelda game there is
you go from being a kid to being an adult
link must beat five temples as an adult the forest temple the fire temple the water temple the shadow temple and the spirit temple
the bosses are awsome and all the characters are coolreading magazines from  one thing you couldnt escape was a some kind of mention of legend of zelda ocarina of time
it was all over the place
popping this in my n when i took it home i spent literally  hours just exploring kokiri village just cause it was so fun
but then i realized quotoh yeah theres more to this isnt therequot and thats when the fun startedgraphics although you can probably debate this this has one of the best graphics youll find on the system
lot of areas just drop that quotwow factorquot like when you first enter zoras domain or the games many cutscenessound although theres no voice except for navis annoying quotheyquot and an occasional quothelloquot from her or links grunts its got some awesome music
one thing i love is the short ocarina songs you play such as song of storms zeldas lullaby and song of time plus general area music
although the overworld music isnt like what it was on link to the past its still greatstory the story starts off with link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman
then link is summoned to the great deku tree where he fills link in on his quest and it goes from there
even though it can be a quite simple story its just a huge epic story that kept me interestedgameplay the infamous ztargeting system thats spawned several developers to use it in their own games
the recent star fox adventures uses this
your cbuttons are for your weapons
b is your sword and a is your action buttontalk jump climbetc
youll know this system by heart cause navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour
camera is excellent and the z targeting helpseven though you might be able to find this i suggest you pick it up
dust off your n and dive into what is one of the s most critically acclaimed and commercial masterpieces everthis is by far the best zelda installment yet
much more fun than majoras mask mainly because you can freely explore the world of hyrule
see review of majoras maskthis game can be fun for anyonei confess ive never played a single zelda game before this cause i wasnt into rpg games but im so glad i never gave this a miss
one day i  just felt like playing this game and i bought it and its terrific no  maybe better than terrific its too good to be truei spent  good  months playing this game and i finally beat it recently but that hasnt  stopped me from planning round  and buying the brady guidebook to find all  the secretsthis game is also filled with charatcer interaction and  drama
i think you can read amazons review for the storyline and ill just  encourage you to buy this game if you haventits a players choice  game and coming from nintendo i am not surprised its this good
im gonna  get majoras mask when it comes out this winter and i hope to see this game  on the dolphinif you are hooked and want to relive the magic go get an  old nes or snes from your cousins or someone and buy the previous zelda  games and youll see why zeldas a classiclike mario zelda has a huge  following and blah blahi dont need to elaborate on the games success  anymoreas far as fungameplaystorygraphicssoundreplay is concerned  its a safe bet to say that i will give every category at least  out of  ill only give it a  when they put in fmv and put to rest once and  for all that zelda is the definitive standardrpg and actionrpg and not  final fantasy
sorry guys i had to say it its truenow if only  majoras mask would arrive sooneroh i cant waitthe legend of zelda ocarina of time is a definite classic
ive owned this game for a good  years and its just extraordinary and fun but at the same time educational
in this game you must do alot of thinking and find out where the secrets are
so in other words its a magical adventure gamethe graphics are actually good for its time and the gameplay is easy to get used to
the controls are also simple and the whole storyline is just well thought out and i can definitely tell that they put alot of time into this game
in my opinion its the best zelda game so farnow i will tell you the beginning of the story so you can even feel more excited about getting this gameas a young baby boy your mother was killed by an evil person
now you have no home and have to move to a place called the kokiri forest
this is a place where people never grow up and arent allowed to leave the forest
theyre called the kokiri
but youre different
you really dont belong in this forest instead you belong out in a world called hyrule
youre a hylian normal people who actually grow up
youre out there to defeat ganondorf
ganondorf most likely the person who killed your mother is a strong and evil person who wants to take over hyrule and become the king
the only person that can stop him is you link
now the question is will you be able to defeat the mean and evil ganondorf and save the world of hyruleif you think or know you can take that responsibility then i suggest that you buy this game along with the n if you dont have one and experience something very special
like i said its a definite classic and will keep you entertained for hours on end
you wont regret itthank you for reading and i hope i was helpful enoughive beaten the game  times and im still not bored of playing it
if you havent played this game then play it
you wont be sorry you did
this is much better than all the other final fantasy and rpg crap out therethis is one of the best games i have ever played
even shooting the arrows is fun you can actually use your shield to block getting hit
just incredible
the only bad thing i can possibly say is you almost have to buy the strategy guide or else you will likely get stuck on some levels
there are a few dungeons that i could not find my way out of without buying the guide
but overall great gamezelda oot is centered around a massive circular field called hyrule
around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons castles villages volcanoes etc each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle and once explored you travel back across hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location
this makes areas more accessible and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible due to the fact that youre not endessly travelling through preexplored ares
backtracking is an important feature of oot due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly  bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths
hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges
the ocarina of time opens secret doors
thus pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game
this is compounded when at one point in the game you aquire the master sword
this is a special sword which upon claiming makes you and the world age by seven years and by doing the reverse putting the sword back in its mold makes you and the world  years younger
the good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different
the future is controlled by evil whereas the past is controled by good
needless to say your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil ganondolf
however in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future worlda main part of this game is the ocarina of time
depending on what tune you play the ocarina will turn night in to day make it rain open secret doors or make blocks disappear amoung other things
this adds an important layer to the game for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress
for instance after spending hours wondering what to do the idea could suddenly hit you should i play zeldas lullaby in front of the waterfall
if successful the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling
the actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history
in fact only computer world by kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in ootby the time zelda oot was released the difficulty in games was just perfect
your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary you were fustrated when you died you were delighted when you succeeded
fustration and anger are both necessary in games because its those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed  unfortunetly since oot games have become so easy that a huge part of the joy in completeting them isnt there anymorei have to say this is the absolute best legend of zelda so far  but there is one thing i have to clarify this is not the first legend of zelda
the first came out on the nes and is great to play  this one has good control fun plot and will get you so wrapped up in it youll come screaming back for morewhoever hates this game should be shot
this is one of the greatest games ever
its the best of link
gamespot gave it a 
anyway enough prasing it
on to my reviewgraphics  looks really good for the time
big vast valleys long mountains clear water beautiful guts of jabujabusound  clash
ahhh
haha
hiya
beautiful ocarina sounds
boommmusic  beautiful music
ocarina songs are deep and moving
composed beautifullygameplay infinity awesome
go through many dungeons filled with tough enimies and hard puzzles
talk to people in town
play many minigames
stealth
this is  extremely fun and addictive
hidden items
you can also find  gold skullutas
play an ocarina
controls are flawlessone of the greatest games of all time
dont play itlive itps
why has amazon combined oot and mm into one
its confusing and its depleting the rating
also gerry atrick the reviewer above me was that troll review even nesscery
you said to contact you  if anybody knew how to get out of the deku tree
well  look on a gaming site and  how can anybody contact you if they dont know your address
and no there isnt a cheat to make link naked
its erated
ah well whaddya expect from a guy from irelandyou must own this if you like games
its spectacular in every way perfect
it creates a breathing world you care about and love while having this awesome deep story and adventurethis game has crossed the i like you line
its just like the old one from nes although i know about the dungeons and the weapons because i have the old one
so its fun to play for a while until you get to the water temple it gets confusing there
so use the players guide to cheat so that you wont get stuck
i played a long time ever since it came out
it was the game that caught my eye and though i had to have the game
i am a zelda fan and i hope that you have fun playing it as well
i just like to see link grow upthe most recent loz games in my opinion have all been fairly average
wind waker was the latest actually good loz game
but of all the loz games oot is just plain incrediblein this game you play as link as he grows from a child into a young man while on his quest to defeat ganon and save the world from ultimate evil rule
along the way you meet many friends and face amazing boss battlesthe graphics at the time were just incredible
it really made me enjoy looking at and playing the game
nintendo really did a great job in this departmentthe gameplay is like no other
one of the few incredible games to utilize the c buttons for vital controls this game felt really comfortable to play and theres tons to do in the game besides just beating it
also throughout the game you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as young or adult link to complete the game which is aweinspiring in my opinion
sadly after doing little everything theres no addictive minigames to really play and not much else to do but go through the game again and againthe sound is incredible and the music has never been better
i found myself turning the volume on the tv all the way up while playing this game because the sound was that goodif youre an avid gamer yet youve never played this game then somethings really wrong with you
pick this game up and play it till your fingers fall off which i guarantee youll do
this game is worth buying and owning for as long as you even are alivethe best game for the n
if you are to have  games for the system it needs to be mario  mario kart smash bros banjo kazooie and zeldathis game is a real gem  treasure it and treat it well it is worth any pricewow what can i say
as im writing this review the popular  consoles right now are ps gamecube and xbox
i have all of those
yet no game on any of those systems are better than this
this is probably the best zelda everi have yet to buy the one for gamecube
deciding between this and majoras mask is a tough call but i think this one gives a little more gametimehow should i begin to describe this game
its deep engrossing and the graphics are spetacular for a n
yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay music and theme
the story is old but hey its a classic formula
why change it
what would zelda be without dungeons
this is one of the few rd person games ive played with great controls
the ztargeting system can change a traveling mode link instantly to a combat alert and maneuverable link
the music fits the moods perfectly from the dark shadow temple to the light and cheery music of the lost woods its great
buy it its worth your money and its probably the best game ever for nthe legend of zelda has always been a series that continually delivers amazing games that are at the top of their class
the legend of zelda has always been my favorite video game series of all time since i was little and their games continually suck away hours of my life
this is the game that made me truly love gamingbefore i just did it for fun
it also set the stage for other great games such as majoras mask wind waker and twilight princessgameplay  if you have played any of the other zelda games you will know that you play as link a young kokiry boy who must go out on the adventure of a lifetime to defeat the evil ganondorf and save princess zelda
the controls are flawless
you just move the analog stick to make link move move forward and press a to roll press b to use your sword the c buttons are home to you other weapons such as the bow hookshot and the like
this game introduced the revolutionary lock on system where you just pressed z and staid locked on to an enemy which meant no more aimless sword swinging it realy made the combat more managable and much more fun  like any zelda game there is a huge overworld to explore
you have grassy plains tall volcanic mountains serene lakes sandy deserts difeerent towns and villages and lots to do
the overworld is just enourmes esspecially for an n game
hyrule feild stretches in all directions
one of the great things about traveling is part way through the game you will get a trusty horse named epona
riding around hyrule feild is just realy addicting
there are many great minigames to do as well such as the shooting gallery bombochu bowling selling mask and fishing yes fishing
there are also special task to do such as collecting ten special poeshuge ghost that appear in hyrule feild or collecting  skulltullasspiders of a horrible curse
the meat and potatoes is of course the dungeons
each dungeon is completley uniqe and different than the last one and shows off alot of great elements
there are many challenging puzzles that reward you when you figure them out
you raise and lower water look for paths that are invisible with the lens of trooth push giant blocks with the silver gauntlets use the megaton hammer to push blocks and much much more
each dungeon is just very well crafted that it is hard to beleive that it came out in   there are many feirce enemies in each dungeon that fight to put an end to your quest such as stalfos bats lizolfos armos iron knuckles jellyfish tektikes readeds skulltullas and so many more
the boss battles are each intricitley desighned and completely different than thre last in the way they look and fight
the boss battle with ganon at the end is one of my all time favorite final battles everonly rivald by the fight in twilight princess and mother brain
the difficulty is always just right with the challenges and enemys getting toupher as you go on
through the game you get alot of fantastic weapons to use such as a bow hookshot megaton hammer hovor boots silver gauntlets boomerangs and much more
each is always put to good use and none of them ever go absolete and are awlays usefull the whole way through  one of the big mechanics is of course the ocarina itself you play it manually with the button layout being like the holes in the real thing
you can change day into night transport across the world map and open passage ways with you trusty instrument and much more
the biggest suprise is after you get the master sword and travel forard in time seven years
time travel is a huge element in this game as some things you do as a child will effect the things you do as an adult and vice versa
there are also different things avalible to do in each time and it is a blast to go between two time periods and it realy makes you feel powerfull
nore matter which aspect of the gameplay i am talking about i cannot find fault anywhere absolutely perfectstory  hyrule was created by din nyrule and farore they left behinf the triforce which lies in the sacerd realm
many years later an evil man named ganondorf seeks the triforce and places a curse on the deku tree and does other horible things to many races 
the deku tree tells navi the fairy that she must awaken link as he has been having a nightmare about the evil man
link goes to get a sword and sheild and goes to see the great deku tree who asks him to rid the curse
link succeeds but finds out that he is far to late
before dying the deku tree tells him the legond of the triforce and gives him the spirituall stone of the forest the kokirys emerald and then tells him to go to hyrule castle to meet nprincess zelda
link goes to hyrule castle meets princess zelda who tells him of the dreams she has been having about ganondorf and ask link to get the other two stones link obliges and gets them but finds that it is to late as princess zelda and impa flee hyrule catsle zelda throws him the ocarina of time
link then comes face to face with ganondorf and gets a taste of his power
zelda then telapethacally teaches him the song of time
link goes to the temple of time and plays it at the alter where the stones are placed and opens the secret chamber where he finds the master sword
link being the legendary hero takes the master sword but finds that he has fallen into ganondorfs trap
he is then seald in time for seven years where he is awakened by the sage of light rareu
link discovers that he is now an adult
and instructs him to find and awaken the other sages
this is where the game gets epic but i wont spoil anymore fore suffice it to say it is a great story that is very well told and will keep you wanting to find out what happens nextgraphics  these graphics were truly groundbraking and ahead of their time back in   the moment you step out into hyrule feild and se the scale and distance you will be mesmerized
the game shows off some fantastic day and night sequences as well as many different colors
hyrule market looks and feels alive the kakariko village will look like a town with houses and shops
the desert esspecially is arguablly the best way to show off the ns power with snadstorms and wind effects
the charecter models are great for lnik to zelda to ganondorf to the bosses to even the npcs
the enemys realy look feirce and different
these graphics truly set the standerd in sound  the sound effects themselves are spectacular like the flowing water the clank of a sword hitting a wall or an enemy the enemy sounds when thay are struck bu the sword or when they are attacking lniks yelps and much more
the game features a brilliant musicalll score koji kondos work is reminiscent of john williams almost and that is not a comparison i make lightly
you will hum the beat of the lost woods love the powerfull melody of the temple of time be entranced by the song of storms there is just so many great melodys that i have lost count
the song of time is truly memorable as well as all of the others
my only complaint might be the lack of the traditional overworld thing and navis annoying hey listen screams but these are all tossed aside once you hear koji kondos work at its finest with the lost woods theme and song of timereplay value  i still play this game nonstop
it truly proves that amazing agameplay oulives any other aspect of a game
there is just so much to do and so much to see and so many places to explore that you will never want to drop the conntrollerthis game is my favorite game of all time and is a must buy for any n owner or enouph of a reason to get one if you do not have one already
it is also avalible on the wii vertuall console and is well worth the download
this is the game of my childhood and i cannont stress enoph how much you need to get this gamei got this game a couple of years ago and i was completly shocked it was really fun and addictive but takes you into a new world called hyrule
throughout the story link has to save hyrule from ganondorf who makes hyrule look like the devils mountain
but if link collects the right items he might save hyrule with the princess of zeldagraphics  the colors really standed out with the houses grassland people etcgameplay  it was a challenging game might be hard to follow through in controlling but ztargeting helps you alot
using new weapons such as swords sheilds bow n arrow hookshot etc was usfull in beatingstoryline  the story was copied by the old zelda from super nintendo but made into a more better world
more places to explore and more side quests to dooverall  my opinon i thought it was a game that everyone even zelda fans should get it for your collection
once you beat it you can actually go for more side quests items to get and other things you missedthis game is just sickeningly good and nothing else since has matched its gameplay depth charm design and atmosphere
it is absolutely flawless and perfectwhen it came out  years or so ago i was hooked to it immediately and i finished it in about a month
but since then i finished it around  more times and i still enjoy playing the full game today after  years
it is that good
the controls are absolutely perfect and the targeting system works perfectly for most combat situationsthe atmospehere of the levels of the game is just the best ever in a game to date
for example in the mysterious forest the lost woods u can actually feel its mystery from the excellent music getting louder as u reach its source and the way the whole place is designedno videogame fan has an excuse not to play or own this
words cannot describe my love for this game
sounds stupid but its true you will so nostalgic even when u meet the characters again for the th time
it is just a gaming masterpiece and i doubt it will be bettered for a veeeeerrryy long time to come unless the new gamecube zelda follows the same direction and improves it with a larger interface and new fresh ideasbuy it it or u will miss out on the best game ever
yes the best game ever  all i can say is if u havent for some reason buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy itzelda  is defenetly one of my favorite games for the n
it has a fairly good story its interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next and it has a gameplay thats unbeatable
the combat system is very simple and great
you have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake
there is so much to do in this game that its comaprable to a good rpg something that n hasnt been blessed with yet
the graphics are pretty good especially since they dont use the expanssion pack and the world is just huge
one down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough and sometimes you may feel lost and dont know what to do next
the bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game
this game will defently take a couple months to beat unless you play 
after you master the game then itll just take a couple of days like any other normal or great game
nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one
one thing i didnt like about it is that it has gotten eaiser than its predicessors
ive started playing zelda games since the snes days
back then it was zelda a link to the past
the game was tough
ill admit it it took me a year to beat that
that game was also huge
but now d has made things eaiser which i like and dont like
but another thing i dont like
they keep on changing the whole story of zelda
those of you who played the snes game will know what im talking about
there link didnt live in a forest and there wasnt a guardian fairy
and the whole world changed too
well maybe its for the best but i wouldnt mind if they made a remake of it maybe for the gbai came across this game in  and immediately recognized it from the cartoon from back in the s
i played it just to try it and i wound up getting so addicted i had to buy it for my n
i would stay up til all hours playing it
its rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you cant help but say okay ima try one more time then im turning it off and still be playing a couple of hours laterthe water temple was the biggest pain for me because i tend to rush into things and wouldnt do things right as far as the puzzles went
i loved the forest temple as a kid
the weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do
the boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach hitting switches and killing enemies
the ones i loved were bombs except when i got too close to them
loli dont remember much else about the game since its been a while since i had time to play it
i do know it took me quite a while before i managed to get some things such as all the poes and golden skulltulas but no matter how many times i play this game it doesnt lose its appeal
like i said its challenging but not so hard that you throw the controller down in frustration and give upits the second easiest game of the three zeldas ive played
twilight princess although very in depth was easy and majoras mask was the hardest but only because i kept running out of time when doing certain tasks
ganon was hard for me to kill at first but i think now that ive played it enough and therefore fought him enough i know what to expect and i can now anticipate what hes going to do and react accordinglyall in all i recommend this game even if the system it was made for is pretty much a thing of the pastthis is a game you could fall in love with
when i first played it immediatly after it came out i was so engrossed and enchanted with it that it was like the real world disappeared and there was just me and the game
this never happened with me with a video game before
the scenery is breathtaking and some of the music scores are beautiful although i think the music in the first forest dungeon as an adult is absolutely creepy
the dungeons are puzzling at times but not too hard and the bosses are challenging enough you may have to try them several times but dont worry you can eventually beat them
the game has a built in save feature so you dont need a memory card and you can save anywhere in the game dont have to wait for any specific save point that is real niceyou start out as a  year old boy and then after  levels you travel through time and become an adult
hyrule has changed and you need to save the land
you go through many levels and bosses to finally get to gannon the ultimate evil here
he is an improvement on the previous gannon of previous zelda gameslooked like a little pig then
and fighting him is more challenging and engrossing in this new game
there are other little side adventures thoughout the game to entertain you when you want a break from dungeons and monsters
this is a high quality game fun for kids and adultswassup fellow gamerz
nubs
lulzmy parents just bought me the legend of zeldo collectors edition for my th birthday
it features this legend of zeldo oracana of time game
i enjoyed this game very mucheven tho the graphics suck
i will give you some of my thoughts nowmy favorite part was when the main character link pulls the supreme sword from the stone in the iceberg temple
oh man
glammondwarf the villain was so cool
he snuck into the secret realm behind link and stole the trueforce of strength
pwnedthe prince zeldo person was really weird
heshe was a tranny who turned into some guy named shaieke who kept stalking link on his journey
then heshe would change back into an elf girl in a dress
what a creep
but zeldo had the trueforce of smartness so i guess that character was okay
zeldo had this tall whitehaired ninja lady named inca as a bodyguard
inca might have been a man too thoughim not sure
she looked kinda like my aunt helgathe link character was really cool
link wears white tights a green toga and had a grappling hook device
he also has this little firefly thing called navely that follows him around
you begin the game playing links little kid brother which kinda sucked
i cant pwn goombas with a little midget goombas are these big skeleton guys
i think the kid brother is supposed be peter pan after he killed captain hook and left neverland maybe they have another game about that partbut later you get to play link who is an adult elf with a pointy nose
he has the trueforce of braveness so that means he is very brave
he can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures
i wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates
later on link gets the bassoon of time and can play it to make it snow
i think link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks
he just goes ugh
hiyah
aughhhhhh
and stuffi think he might be a cannibal or vampire too because he eats hearts to gain health
there is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when its time to feedyou pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with
but they look really big so i wonder how link can carry so many in his pockets
and if you dont pick the rublees up soon enough they begin flashing and disappear
i guess theyre likebig holograms or something like in star wars
why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks
i really wish i could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like thatthere are these fish people named zurros
they have this giant jellyfish named mr jabba jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fishman
i think it was the zurro kings pet and he lost it
but you have to carry it all around mr jabba jabbas stomach so its kinda annoyingthen there are these big rock guys called gordos that like to roll down mountains
they are my favorites because they live in this mountain called doom mountain
it explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you
holy that evil glammondwarf guy is a member of the garundo thieves
they are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach
but they dont have any men in their race so i dont understand how there are so many garundos
maybe some of them are trannies like zeldo
i think glammondwarf might be one
he kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughssooooo all of these people live in this magical land called hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters
i think its supposed to be kinda like toon town from roger rabbit
its such a huge place
it takes forever to ride across it on links horse ramona
thats right
you get a horse
link steals it from mario and luigi at some ranch
so i guess link is kinda a thief
maybe hes really one of those garundo thieves
he does kinda look like a girl
but hes not a ginger so im not sureaaaanywayplay this bassoon of time game
it is full of so much win
i hope i didnt give too much of it away
lulz
one  xdwtkidthe legend of zelda ocarina of time is simply put the best adventure game i have ever played
im a newcomeer to the zelda series so im not too sure how ocarina rates with the others but i love it
for an nintendo  the graphics are absolutely beautiful
the lighting rivals that of a playstation  or xbox or game cube
the sound is terrific
each different sound effect was done in detail
the sword against stone and the sword against wood are not the same as in a lot of games and sound just like they should
the echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and links footsteps are done perfectly
the puzzles are challenging but not so that you want to through the controller down in frustration but so that you wont put the controller down until youve figured them out
the minigames and the sidequests will keep you playing long past the time youve beaten the game itself because they are so plentiful
the controls take some getting used to but are perfect for the games combat system
the targeting especially helps the later you get into the game
the music is captivating and is very well done
overall i think this is one of the best games ever not just in adventure
its definetly a game anybody with a nintendo  should havewhat a game
i have played zelda for nes snes and now the n  a link to the past was a great game but this is the best zelda game
the graphics are graet
teh temples are huge
this is the best game for the n
majoras mask is great too but this one is better
sp i reccomend this game to everyone
it truly is one of ns best
cant wait to see zelda on gamecubei love this game
you cant say that you are a zelda fan if you dont own this game
this game features an awesome storyline unforgettable characters and just keeps getting better
you could play this game forever and not get tired of it
if you have a n system you better own this game
or if you have a gamecube you should have the legend of zelda collectors diskunless youve been living in a box your whole life chances are youve heard about what an incredible game this is
nay i will go as far as to say perfect
even if you havent grown up with the zelda series youre still likely to find this game quite enjoyable
its safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all timethe story begins as a young link awakens in a small tree hut
staying true to past games you start off with no items or weapons
you soon learn that the great deku tree wishes to see link and thus you set out to explore kokiri forest
upon taking your first steps outside you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest
while you search the area for a sword you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment
once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items you head for the great deku tree accompanied by your faerie friend navi
after completing this first dungeon the deku tree explains the history of the triforce and rewards link with the spiritual stone of the forest thus setting the story in motionthe graphics of this game are fantastic for its time
you can now journey through a fully navigable d map
the details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting be it a forest village a watery temple a haunted underground maze or the inside of a giant fishs belly
the map of hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore
the cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together welli absolutely love the controls in this game
everything is pretty intuitive the a button is used to execute actions the b button swings your sword and the c buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play
youre able to roll and jump swim and climb block attacks stab and build up power for swing attacks
but the greatest addition to the control features is the z targeting ability
this function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object
moreover this button will focus the camera directly behind link allowing you to have control over your point of view
to this day i compare games camera controls to ocarina of time often wishing for that very desirable z targeting capability
a great addition to your supply of character controlsthe story itself builds upon previous games in the series for we interact with familiar characters like zelda and ganondorf in addition to many new individuals
as always there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels some that are familiar and some that are new to this title
what makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time
you begin the story as a child growing as a warrior and searching for the spiritual stones
when you travel into the future the world has become darker and your missions more challenging
there is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests
the multitude of puzzles games and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining
the endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich enjoyable plot furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aidand the game would not be complete without sound
again ocarina of time gains a perfect score here
the sounds that link makes when he fights moves and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable
the echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in
likewise the soundtrack is just as appropriate
each level has a different musical score and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings
also some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic yet new
the ocarina songs are appealing as well adding another interesting component to the gameplay
ocarina of time really has a wonderful soundtrack and even today i still enjoy listening to itall in all this game is truly a classic and yet another impressive sequel in the zelda series
from the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack ocarina of time is a gem in the adventure game genresimply the best
great story great graphics great control great replay value
it is true n wasnt that great of a system with pretty horrible games
i bought it back in  and up until i got my ps i only bought a few games for it  zelda ocarina zelda majora goldeneye perfect dark and dk
there may be other good games but this game is by far the best not just on n  but possibly out of all video games ever
trust me people if i say it is good it is good
i dont give out good reviews very easilythe legend of zelda ocarina of time is really awesome but how awesome
is it the best of the legend of zelda series so far
oh undeniably but that is not the point
my point is that it was the best game for the nintendo  with super mario  and its direct sequel majoras mask in a second place draw
it shows how the franchise began
link sets off on a journey to save hyrule from the evil ganondorf for the first time
he meets princess zelda on the way and when she flees from ganondorf she leaves the legendary ocarina of time in links possession
he uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the master sword
the graphics were neat for the time the storyline was really exciting and there is a lot of stuff to collect
the dungeons were challenging and the boss fights are neat
if you are a fan of nintendo please pick this up
you will be glad you didwith almost three years in the making how did the legend of zelda ocarina of time stand the test of time itself
as a prequel to the entire legend of zelda series it has caught heavy anticipation
ocarina is a prequel to the events before a link to the past
link is a child whose destiny is to save the land of hyrule from ganon gannondorf here by traveling through time
youll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow hylians kokiri zoras and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save hyrule
ocarina of time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along
in the end the game is an actionrpg and should never be classified in the style of traditional turnbased rpgs like final fantasynew additions to the series are automatic jumping and ztargeting
the emphasis of the zelda games has always been puzzlesolving and dungeon arrangement
you also build your attributes receiving items including the ocarina learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling
along with minigames hidden items and side quests equal its a worthwhile experience
graphicswise hyrule never looked better and most effects in ocarina of time are outstanding
no need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates but rather focus on detail and designer talent
the realtime cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive
the sound also holds its own on this cartridge format
the themes of zoras domain and gerudo valley are music to the ears
zelda fans will remember tunes of kakariko village and zeldas lullaby
a big plus is that all the sound effects from previous zelda games have made a comebackin the end the legend of zelda ocarina of time makes the cut
even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeondwelling and puzzlesolving the impressive graphics quality sound and everything thats been obtained from previous zelda titles will keep fans and nonfans alike entertained
its funok i figured id throw in my opinion as well
mainly this review is for people who have not played the game yet and are wondering if they should
perhaps you arent too into rpgs or whatever so it is my job to convince you
first off its more of an rpgadventure combination since it doesnt use conventional rpg techniques like turns or experience
but that is a good thing because the way the game is structured allows for neartotal freedom as you play it
yes like some people have said you must beat the dungeons in a certain order but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more
it is truly the greatest game i have ever played that is no exaggeration
the graphics and the sound are wonderful the puzzles are not as easy as some people are saying  the water temple is maddening
 and the character development and depth of play is unmatchedmajoras mask is almost as good but what makes ocarina of time better in my opinion is the fact that it is sort of the quotultimatequot zelda game meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of link and zelda and ganon and it is a completely standalone and definitive game
majoras mask on the other hand takes place right after the events of ocarina of time and has a very different structure
the threeday cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game but the only downside is you cant take your time and relish everything like you can in ocarina of timeeither way though ocarina of time is a beautiful gamethe best game i ever play
in fact i beat this game in a week
its a good deal and is worth the money
big timei have played many many many video games in my life and this game is literally the best game that i have ever played in my life
its nice and long like all the other zelda games it has a perfect level of difficulty there are so many different weapons in the game there are so many memorable dungeons and fields in the game well i could go on forever
i wish i could give this game a higher score than the measly star rating amazoncom forces me to give but alas i cannot
if you own a nintendo  buy this game right now
if you dont own an n you can still buy it for gamecube its the same exact game
i own it for both n and gamecube
if you like this game then buy the sequel too
its called majoras mask
im telling you you will definetly not regret buying this game if you are a diehard zelda fan or even if you are not a diehard zelda fan
although i dont know who would be reading a review of a game that was made in nineteen ninetysomething in  if you are reading this buy this game right now and if you dont you are missing out
everything about this game is perfect
that is allthis is the nd best game ive ever played
even if i like excitebike  more i cant wait until i can get this
i dont have it but my brother and i got all the way to forest temple from the start in just  days
then we had to return it
but its my favorite zelda game everface the facts all these young gamers in the world do not know what it is  like to grow up with a legacy on your tv screen
i do
upon first playing  of the oot i found it to be quite exhilirating and as game play continued  i was reminded of the greatness of those that came before it
yes the  game was a little difficult but if you whine about how you couldnt get  past the first level either gain some skills or do not enter the arena  with true gamers
if you did not play the original zelda you will not do  well with this one
this is by far the greatest zelda of the series and i  cant wait to see what the future hods
true gamers you know what i meanocarina of time is definitely the best game on the nintendo super mario perfect dark and f zero x are awesome but ocarina of time is the best out of any other game on the systemwhat else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at role playing games foreverthe graphics are awesomesome game cube games dont look this good the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellentwhereas the difficulty in super mario  stayed pretty much the same throughout the game ocarina of time gets harder when you get to be a better playeralso you get an extra heart after beating bosses because youll need itits very challenging i still havent beaten it and am not sure if i ever willeasy games can be a lot of fun but they just arent as substantial as a game like thisthe challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls
its just a great game and is a must for any zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging gameswhat isnt great about this game
im so glad that this game has so many reviews because it definitely deserves it
ocarina of time remains one of my favorite videogames of all time
yes the generation of gaming is getting wider and graphics are getting beautiful with each console but the legend of zelda ocarina of time on n doesnt add up to them
well at least to me it doesnt
ive seen a few  star reviews about people bashing the game only because its no everquest or halo
this game is so good that you dont compare its style or graphics with something in todays modern gaming
this is an old school game
you just dont compare old games to new ones
i believe theres a favorite for every generation
this one happened to fall into the n genre when gaming was really starting to pick up
and honestly you think over  star reviews were written all by children
we were children when we all played the game
and looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history
kids that didnt get to exprience the nes snes and n missed out on a great gaming genre and though the generation of gaming today is awesome theres nothing on the classicsocarina of time remains my favorite game of all time even before some of my new favorites and theres nothing like turning on that n and playing over and over again
i never tire of this game
it is a true classicgame type role playingsystem ngraphics awesome especially for its timedifficulty moderate it depends if you want all the items and secrets or not
not hard just to beat howeverage recommendation  and upcharacter quality love themplayback value there is always something fun left to dogold cartridge availability i have one p they dont make them anymore but you may be able to find one usedlink the courageous hero of time must save hyrule and princess zelda from the powerful wizard ganandorf
along the way link will meet many people who can help him on his quest as well as provide items and host minigames to make it more fun
can link defeat ganondorf and save the triforce
buy this game and become part of the adventure
travel through time to play both child and adult link
ocarina of time never gets boring or tedious and is neither too hard nor too easy for any level of gaming skill
if you missed it in  its time to get it and get in on the action
the sequel majoras mask is also coolonce again hyrule is being threatened by the forces of evil
as link the chosen hero you solve countless puzzels and fight many many monstersthis game has about everything
good graphics great gameplay and a wonderful storyganondorf the evil in the game needs to get the tree spiritual stones to open the tempe of time
he threatened the people who have them but they didnt give him the stones
link goes on quests to get the tree stones
once he gets them and zelda the princess gives him the ocarina of time  he opens the temple of time
but little does he know ganondorf followed himseven years later link wakes up and ganondorf rules hyrule
he spreaded five of the six medallions and had monsters gaurd them
you get the only medallion ganondorf didnt have and go on a quest to find the othersthis game is great and has a wonderful selection of weapons and other things
i highly recommend it and for anyone who has a nintendo  get this game for your  collection isnt complete without iti remembered a time my older brother borrowed this game from a friend of his
i liked it so much but when it came to the time for my brother to give it back i was upset
but no worries i was  at the time when that happened now that im older i was able to buy my own copyone of the best games of all timeyou get the thrill of beating all the bosses playing the ocarina and riding epona around hyrule
never going to regret getting this game
one of my favoritesthe legend of zelda ocarina of time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game i have ever played in my entire lifei have been playing nintendo for years and i have played some of the older zelda games before but i never owned any as soon as i tried this game  i immediately loved it and ive played it millions and millions of times
i am so obsessed with it i went out and preordered the wind waker to get the zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to nintendo power to get the zelda collectors edition discthere is no need for me to review this game  all i really need to say is buy it
you will not be disappointed if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain
definitely be sure to get the follow up majoras mask and the wind waker
a must play and link is the best hero everman i remember getting this game when i was around  years old and alll those hours i spent beating this game over and over again
i gurantee ive beaten this game at least  times honestly
though the n is outdated from time to time i take it out of my closet and plug it in just to play this game
i hope the twilight princess will be just the samego out and buy it and play it yourself and see what i mean ok the levels are great and there is alot to do
the places that you go are in the mountains lakes valleys and in caves and a little ranch somewhere
link lives in kokiri forestin the game you have to get three stones somewhere
one in the deku tree and one in goron city and one in the zoras domain
some time in the game you will be older by the time you look around the place will be deadyou as link and you have to save the world form evil form the evil king name ganondori and his evil plans before its too late
and save a beautiful princess name zelda
and you get to meet other characters in the game too some are cool some are big and some are smallbuy the the legend of zelda ocarina of time official strategy guide its a big help to me and you if you with iteverything revealed to youps
i know everything in the game do you
i play it and i love itif you have an n you absolutely should have this game
its a remake of the classic zelda game from the good old nes and snes systems with some added twists new terrain and interesting charactersif you have a gamecube i would recommend you preorder the upcoming title quotthe wind wakerquot and if you do this right now nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of quotocarina of timequot for game cube
not just the good old quotocarina of timequot made famous on n but also an enhanced version called quotmaster questquot make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great valuehappy huntingwhen i first got my gamecube this game was part of the zelda collectors edition
i didnt know much about zelda and had only played very few games before but was mesmerized by this game
the beginning of it is so magical and imaginative it really draws you in to the story
i found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because i didnt have my memory card yet
this game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant ominous beautiful and haunting
i had never experienced anything like it
to this day i have never been so absorbed by another gamewhats really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent
the music is also exceptional
the music is better than most movie soundtracks in my opinion
all of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game
so much happens in this game it has a lot of cinematic scenes too which really develop the story which is an excellent tale of good versus evilocarina of time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything i know of
there are a few films and books that would come close but i cant think of anything that could quite surpass it
ocarina of time is an involving authentic scary and epic adventure
playing it for the first time makes for an unparalleled experiencethis is one of the best games
you have to play it
it is definitely the best game in the zelda series so far
it has adventure romance mystery and so many subquests
its about a boy named link who has a destiny
he lives in kokiri village a little tiny village in the land of hyrule
anyway a little fairy named navi comes and says that he must meet the deku tree
he does and the deku tree tells him to go inside the deku tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him
link does this and the deku tree gives him the kokiri emerald or the spiritual stone of forest
the deku tree phrophesies that ganondorf an evil desert gerudo man is trying to get hold of the triforce the essence of life in hyrule
but in order to get hold of the triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones
unfortuantely after the trees prophecy he died because of the curse ganondorf had cast upon him
but link and navi go on their journey and get the gorons ruby or spiritual stone of fire and the zoras sapphire or spiritual stone of water
link gets the ocarina of time but when he opens the doors ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the triforce
link waits seven years in the chamber of time and when he awakes hes all grown up
rauru the sage of light is there and tells him that he must save all the sages from their temples and receive the medallions
he receives the medallion of light forest fire water shadow and spirit
but the game
its definitely one of the best n games aroundthere comes a point when sooner or later one has to admit that they have reached a mile stone
this is it
look no further than the game that changes everything that went before it
yes certainly other games can compete graphically with this but innovation is an entirely different proposition
zelda then innovates on an unparalleled scale
weather nightday age all real aspects which merely touch the surface of this monumentous achievementto be really honest there is no real weakness with this game
no puzzle will stop you in your tracks
there is always something to do
in fact it will take you a lot longer to find everything the game has to offer than it would to finish other games
and this is where the distinction comes in
you can label this as an adventure game if you like
but it is beyond comparison with everything else
thus meaning that it should be catagorised in a genre by itself
or at least as a game that redefines an entire genrethere are no comparisons
forget other inferior games that try and emulate and better this
forget the games that rely on pretty visuals to impress
zelda has all these and so so much more
buy this it is that simplethe legend of zelda ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time but it is neither the best n game or the best game in the series
it is the second best of both
the best n game is mario  and the best zelda game is the wind waker
that said this is one of the most innovative most fun and most interesting games of all time
the overworld is huge there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight
ocarina of time is a true classicpresentation graphics sound gameplay replay value overall i remember all the hype surrounding the legend of zelda the ocarina of time like it was just yestarday
the zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system and with the power of the soontobereleased nintendo  the series was finally going to reach its next step the third dimension
this along with other titles like super mario  and mario kart  got both gamers and the press excited about the n and the upcoming zelda game
while the nintendo  never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype the legend of zelda the ocarina of time managed to not only live up to its respected hype but in many ways surpass itwhat makes toot special imo is the fact that it is the first game that ive played where you truly feel like a part of its world
many games tried hard to accomplish this feat including previous zelda titles but toot was the first game to finally get it right
even the later majoras mask never quite managed to create the immersive world toot didmuch of the games feeling stems from the interactivity of its world
you can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see
for example many of the games locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies as well as hear some pretty haunting music
once you obtain the stone of agony however you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning
i wont go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it
another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous zeldas is character interaction
remember how decidedly generic a lot of the npcs in zeldas ii and iii were
in toot each and every npc is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish himher from the rest of the games characters as well as once again feel like youre a part of hyrule
and of course the third dimension the dimension we live life through helps the game a great dealthe gameplay is equally great
i especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one which is especially helpful in the games dungeons which often require you to use several different weaponsitems
speaking of which the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game i had ever played
and i really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous zeldas this was especially annoying in a link to the past where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original legend of zelda
and of course the games graphics are among the ns best not necessarely because of how detailedrealistic they are but how carefully crafted and full of life they are and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game even with the star fox quality midi samplesin brief the legend of zelda the ocarina of time is an excellent game
if you own an n and have not already picked this game up i strongly suggest you do
if you do not even own an n than the systems worth picking up just for this one game and its semisequal majoras maskthis last year of  et did a survey about the best video game series ever
zelda one there poll and this game is one of the reasons whyocarina of time tells the continuing story of the zelda universe
in the zelda timeline it takes place before the other games
as usual you are the hero link
you must save the princess zelda
you have different quests you must finish and many obstacles that will block your way
the story is that ganondorf the evil wizard is trying to take over the world
equipped with the ocarina of time you will travel time in your quest to save zelda hyrule and the worldthis game is jam packed with stuff to do
id say you have a garunteed  hours of gameplay
it has all the classic zelda weapons and more
you get to ride a horse across the country side and do some impressive underwater work
there are just so many impressive factorsi love this game
i cant thing of words to describe how good it is
if you have an n your collection is not complete until this game is put in itlet me put it like this if i had to destroy every videogame i own except one this is the one i wouldnt destroy
this is simply the greatest game ever made
im not going to insult this game by trying to describe the storyline or graphics etc you have to experience it for yourself
most helpful thing i can do is tell you how you can get to play this
this game has had dozens of ports
one came on a bonusdisc for gamecube with windwaker in  and another came in a collectors edition master quest also for gamecube
if you cant get ahold of one of these the original for n or a rom you should buy a wii and download it from the wii virtual console
it will be worth the whilei really should have the kids writing this i think they liked this game but yet there was something lacking in all the zelda gameszelda is eailsy the best game i have ever played
the graphics are excellent you forget you are playing a game
my dad thought it was a cartoon
the story is wonderful too
i wont give anything away but i almost cried at the end
and the music is great
you will find yourself humming the gerudo theme song
i highly recommend this game but i suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without oneits really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone elsei had to start over about three times
but the replay value is good too
thats why i give zelda  starsseriously
as awesome as the games before and after this game are there is truly no touching oot
the story is amazing and well thought out the game play is simple the music is suburb and all console zelda games stem from this right here
such as excellent game
there is no surprise many gaming magazines regard oot as the greatest zelda game or video gameof all timeback in the late s i wrote two articles for a now defunct game website about ocarina of time
one is a review of the title and the other is the how in many ways ocarina of time feels like a remake of the eternal snes classic and my personal favorite zelda game the legend of zelda a link to the past
rather than leave them unposted i issued them on amazon back in  one article on the collectors edition zelda  a remake
and and one on the regular edition an actual review of the game
when the ds version came out i wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content
originally this review only featured one of the two articles  i am now putting both articles upmike london this commentary on ocarina of time was written as a gaming article for a retrogaming site back in may of   i was going to post it on amazon but for some reason never got around to it
mike london november  article  does zelda  really live up to all the hype
blurb with all the hype its hard to be objective about oot
is it the best game in the series or does it have to settle for second or egad third
best
is it like star wars episode i all special effects and no substance
find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer
the legend of zelda ocarina of time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history
in fact i think i could safely say it is the most hyped game yet
there is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype and this product is in an entirely different industry
star wars episode i had the same amount of coverage
being a big fan of both of course ive beat the game and have seen the movie
and they have one thing in common
theyre both eye candy
but how do they hold up to the rest of the series
in my opinion the empire strikes back is by far the best star wars movie
but what about oot you ask
how can i defame such an instant classicone reason mainly
in the original and in the legend of zelda link to the past i cant speak for zelda ii because i havent beat it yet the ending was spectacular
not the game ending for the legend of zelda was produced in the stone age and there was much ending wise but the last dungeon
ah the last dungeon
only recently like december   have i beat the first quest of the legend of zelda
that last dungeon on death mountain was a killer a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it save princess zelda and beat that nasty ol gannon
it was truly a great dungeon
now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the snes version
what have we here
a dungeon comparable to that in the original legend of zelda
everything is bigger and better in the snes version including the last dungeon
whew and i thought the original was harder but no waythen in  we see the release of the game boy version of zelda
the legend of zelda links awakening was released to a very receptive crowd
but guess what
no end dungeon
in terms of dungeons this is the smallest of the zelda titles again not including zelda ii
you beat eight dungeons and then you go and beat the wind fish
personally im half a dungeon away from completing this zelda game dungeon seven which i completed half of went and beat eight and now im back on the last half of vii
that last dungeon was challenging granted but what about that classic end dungeon
no where to be found here
granted its a game boy game and it is huge for that consol
so that offence is not to serious
and we did get a new dungeon though not the ending i was hoping for with the colour dungeon on dx which was the rerelease of the classic game for game boy colourafter five long years the legend of zelda orcarina of time was released for the n
so cool
link in a d adventure
about time too
mario the cash cow counterpart to link got his d adventure way back in   of course i bought the game
and of course i beat it
it is an excellent game
truly it is one of the great classics
but one flaw keeps it from edging out the legend of zelda link to the past
the end dungeon absolutely sucked
that is my only disappointment with that game
as i was nigh the close of the shadow temple i was really looking forward to getting into gannons tower
i was expecting a great closer dungeon just like in link to the past
spoiler if you havent beat the  version of zelda dont read thiswhat did we get
instead of a great closer dungeon we got a door way that was blocked by barriers
what did we have to do
go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway
and what did i get
a great disappointment
sure this might have been a good way to end a novel or something but to end a zelda game like that was horrible
the game boy was forgivable and acceptable but this ending to zelda  was truly despicable
that has been my biggest disappointment with the zelda series
spoiler finishedothers say the legend of zelda ocarina of time is the best zelda game
i have to disagree
dont get me wrong
it is easily one of my favorite games of the n
its a great game very innovative espically that nifty z targeting feature and an epic in its own right
but for what the system is capable of the legend of zelda link to the past beats it out of the coveted title of best zelda game
lttp is huge
it fully utilized the snes technology
it had a full twelve dungeons two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever
thats one more than the original has
loz has one closer dungeon for each quest
after you beat the bad guy twice you go and fight ganon
there were plenty of side quests for an snes zelda also
overall for the systems capabilites lttp is my favoritebut what about the legend of zelda oot
my two chief complaints are these  weak closer dungeon as i spent a good time detailing up above  not enough bad guys to kill in the overworldall other zelda games including the black sheep of the family zelda ii has plenty of bad guys to kill in the overworld
but what have we in oot
a few measly skeleton dudes at night and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in hyrule field
give me the old zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen
for all the time they put into it you dont think it would be to hard to correct this problemthen we come to another mistake nintendo made in the n version of zelda
granted loz had two main tracks one being the overworld theme and then the dungeon theme
they could have had more variety but it was back in the stone age
that overworld theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series
and guess what they decided to omit music wise from oot
the overworld them from the original loz
i couldnt believe they did that
hopefully well see it in zelda gaiden
maybe the triforce will show up in that game too
just a thoughtnow after railing on oot for a great majority of this article you may think i hate the game
quite the opposite really
its a great game and worthy to be in the zelda series
gee it sounds like im defending zelda ii which ive already done in a separate article
but it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of nintendo and it is totally out of balance
great d game but would have been better had it corrected the problems i stated above
its a fun game and i had a great time beating it
it provides a lot of enjoyment
but just like star wars episode i it just cant live up to all that hype
i wonder if any game or movie could actually
may    an article originally written for nintendolandcom
ive written four released articles and one unreleased article dealing with smb 
it will have to be edited
also perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article
article originally this was written for a retrogaming site back in early january  it has never appeared on amazon
zelda  a remake
blurb zelda  and snes zelda has several similarities almost to the point that the basic game design of zelda  is a remake
read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena
just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer
after playing the course of the legend of zelda ocarina of time ive noticed something very intriguing about it
it seems to be a rehash of what i feel is the best zelda game loz link to the past
why do i say this
i say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between zelda  and lttplets examine it
for one there are three pendants you have to acquire in lttp
this is after you go and rescue zelda and leave her at the temple
well this time around you dont rescue zelda but you do go and talk to her
after that when you get the three pendants you go and she is kidnaped
this is after you get the master sword in the lost woods
in zelda  you go thru the first part of the quest getting three spiritual stones
after you get those three spiritual stones which i think the tower on lttp is much better than that d lord jabu jabus belly
i hated that dungeon
 you go to the town
guess what as link approaches there it cuts to a cinema and zelda is kidnaped by ganondorf
hmm 
havent we seen this story before
it turns out that you have to get  of the sages medallions
rauru conveniently gives you one so we can cut the sixth one away
only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight ganondorf
how intriguingin the superiour snes zelda counterpart it is seven crystals and you dont get one given to you
link wakes no sages this time
instead the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons and link has to transverse thru  dungeons all together  the first part and eight the second part
they are challenging fun and intriguing
granted zelda  has some great stuff
but it is not as consistent as lttp
after you have gone thru the seven dungeons two more than in zelda  you now have all seven crystals
thats great
now go to death mountain and by doing so you will open the way to ganons big bad templeokay what do we have in zelda 
you go and get the five medallions plus the one that rauru gives you as link
guess what
now you have to go to his tower and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions
 hmm 
isnt that what we did in snes zelda
why i do believe it is watsonanother issue yet addressed is the light worlddark world
zelda  does the same thing save this time it is time traveling im not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this 
thats a whole separate article in itself
in snes zelda you have a little mirror the old man gave you
there are eight transporters located thruout hyrule transporting back and forth
if you are in the dark world you can use the mirror to go into the light world making a temporary transporter
well in zelda  there is no mirror or transporters the closest to a mirror is the lens of truth found nigh in the shadow temple
but if you go and put the sword back then you go back to being young
that creates two versions of the same world to explore
that structural symmetry corresponds to lttp
not only that but at the end if the first three stones link goes to the temple of time and gets the sword
this is after the three spiritual stones goes into place
hmm 
isnt that what happened in lttp
after getting the three pendents link goes to the lost woods and retrieves the master sword
but he cannot do that until he has all three pendents
well thats the same in zelda  he cant get the ocarina of time now can he retrieve the sword until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones
i swear ive played this game before 
 the real question is why did nintendo do this
well miyamoto is a great gamming god but as far as stories go his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense
again another article another time
the structural symmetries lying between zelda  and lttp is quite frightening
who knows why they chose to do that
granted the story line is different but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same
in reviewa listing of structural symmetries between snes zelda and zelda  snes first part link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing zelda
this is to get the master sword
upon doing so and after giving the pendants up to retrieve the sword zelda is kidnaped
n link after receiving a mission from the deku tree goes and wins the three spiritual stones
upon doing so he goes to hyrule city but not before learning zelda is kidnaped
he places the three spiritual stones in their place and the door of time is opened and there the sword is
retrieving the sword goes to the temple of sages or whatever it is called
is given first sage medallion
snes after winning the three pendents link must now go between two versions of the world light worlddark world
link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game
n in this great stunning adventure link must go between two versions of his world
one is when he is young the other when he is an adult
this is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal
just like in snes lttp link have to go back and forth to finish the gamewhen he is an adult things are noticeable more evil for ganons power has grown
snes one version light world is good because not corrupted by ganon
version ii dark world is an evil corrupted version of the light world
n one version young links world is not corrupted by ganons evil
ganon has just recently showed up
version ii adult links world is an evil corrupted version albeit older of young links world
the only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing in zelda  its the time barrier
but for game play theyre the same
snes he link must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons sounds logical
with the maidens power they will open to door to ganons castle
n link has to recover five medallions to open ganons tower
snes the massive closer dungeon is a tower
n the weak closer dungeon is a tower
snes after beating ganon you save zelda who had been kidnaped
although one could argue you save her in turtle rock she is still imprisoned in the crystal with the other maidens each in their respective crystals
n sticking to the standard nintendo story after recovering the medallions and beating ganon guess what link saves zelda
theres a shocker
snes there are various minigames heart pieces and extra things to do
this trend is continued in links awakening also
zelda  stuck with the trend of minigames four heart pieces to make a heart and extra things to do
snes in some of the houses you can find a picture of mario on the wall
n in zelda  after meeting zelda look out the window and you can find some pictures of mario luigi bowser and the princess
yoshi also comes up
malon and talon wear bowser amulets also
just goes to show nintendo likes cameosas you can see for yourself the various structural symmetries between zelda  and snes zelda is quit a few
if miyamoto wanted to do a remake of lttp for n thats what he should have done i suppose
this as far as story goes is pretty much an update with little changed
its like they took the games basic plot changed the circumstances and added where appropriate but allowing the basic structure to stand
and although both are great games sadly snes is better consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex
but i love ocarina of time all the same
this just helps support my believe that nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company not a writing company
in all previous zelda games the end dungeon was in the mountains
this is the first game in the series to break that trend
the first three zelda i ii and lttp their dungeon was in death mountain
links awakening links only game boy adventure currently is in tal tal mountains
at least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic seriesthis is one of the best games i have ever played
i love the gameplay
it was easy to control the character
i also enjoyed how it wasnt a very easy game
when a game is challenging i play it more and more
in fact i still play this game today
very good gamethis is the nd best nintendo  game to date right behind golden eye  we all know that golden eye  is impossible to top but this comes damn near closezelda ocarina of time is a classic
five stars plus
matter of fact this is the best zelda release i have ever played
and i have played them allthe graphics really show what the nintendo  is capable of putting out along with other classics like mario  and golden eye
the graphics are amazing and are top notchthe storyline is even better
most good rpgs have more than just one single character
this game however only has link and still manages to become a classic like most of the other zelda titles
no this game is no final fantasy iiv but in a way this game is better
maybe not as long but the storyline is a little bit more creative and catchyocarina of time offers a little bit more quotextrasquot than the previous zelda titles have to offer
you can collect extra items along the way for personal score to see how good your discovering ability is and not just finding pieces of hearts
there are so many secrets with this gamei would suggest you dont use the strategy guide until you have completed the game
if you do then you are cheating yourself and making the game not even worth playing
beat the game and then look at the guide to see what you have missedoverall i spent a lot of time on this game
i could have beaten it a lot faster but that wouldnt be any fun because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itselfbuy the game and see for yourself
this isnt exactly a hard challenge of a game but it isnt exactly that simple either
just right
get it todaynotethis is the gamecube collectors edition versioni remember ten years agoseeing the commercial for this gamei always did wonder what it was likeafter getting the collectors edition i immediately got started on itthe story focusesas alwayson linklink is a young boy living in the kokiri forestone night he has a nightmareand wakes to discover a fairy named naviwho will help him through his journeyhe is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of kokiri forestthe great deku treeis dying from a cursethe tree passes along a spiritual stone and recommends to see princess zeldalink does so and zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so link can get the master sword to stop ganonking of the gerudosfrom entering the sacred realm and stealing the trifocea divine reliclink achieves the other stones and the ocarina of timelink draws the sword and finds out he has been tricked by ganonwho entered the sacred realmlink awakens seven years laterand after discovering he is now an adultmeets rauru the sage of lightaccording to rauruthe only way to defeat ganon is to awaken the five sagesthat is where the true quest beginswowwhat a storynowthe graphics are not bad by todays standardsneither are the dungeonsthey are amazingand also very complicated
please dont mention the water templeoverall this game can be summed up by one wordperfectbuy the gamebecome the heroand have the time of your lifeocarina of time is a massive epic actionadventure game out for the n
many have been tempted to call it the best game ever just read some other reviews but i would step back from that
it is still one of my favorite games despite the fact that i play mostly rpgs
by the way zelda is not an rpg even though you do talk to people and have a swordin zelda you play as link zelda is the princess not the main character as you go on a quest to save the world from the evil ganondorf by freeing each of six spirits from their different temples
you change between times where you are adult or child link and you have to switch often and do different things in both and each time has different weapons and items
the timetraveling aspect of the game is one of the coolest partsthe realtime combat is a lot of fun and fairly well put together
it involves a ztargeting system in which you can select a monster and then keep it in the center of the screen and move around it
the fights against other monsters with swords and shields are great as a result
ztargeting is not perfect but it works wellthe dungeons are all awesome and very unique
each dungeon is mostly based around one particular item or weapon its own gimmick but despite that they really dont seem forced and stay fresh all the way through although the last couple dungeons arent nearly as long as the others almost like the designers started getting bored
for the most part the dungeons arent too difficult if you know what to do but it is very easy to get stuck if you dont and the game often leaves you on your own to figure out what to do especially on side quests so having a good walkthrough nearby is helpfulthe overall story isnt too great for the most part save the princess but many of the individual events and side stories are neat
the characters and different races which populate the world are cool especially the gorons which are one of the best races ever
the bosses of each dungeon are awesome as well as being original and can usually be beaten by hacking them up or through the use of special tactics
its always good to have a choicedespite how good it is zelda isnt perfect
the graphics for example are nice but they are old and on the n
the music is okay but mostly just ambient and the classic zelda overworld theme is conspicuously missing
having to constantly change which items you have equipped is also annoying even if there isnt really a better system available
some would say zelda has an almost kiddy atmosphere and suffers from an occasional lack of seriousness i would tend to disagree
and of course the fairy is annoying but no reason to like the game any lessall in all zelda is a great game and a must buy for any n owner as it is one of the best actionadventure games ever
if you are looking for an rpg look elsewhere
this isnt one
and be prepared to get a little frustrated
zelda is pretty long especially if you do everything there is to do
maybe  hours if you run straight through but  it could take many more depending on how much extra stuff you do or how often you get stuck
have funi first started playing ocarina of time from a good friend of mine
the graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories
i dont see why anybody would give this game only  star
i sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game
next time im in a video game store
i am going to buy this game
first of all the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping
a fairy comes to him and wakes him up
then you have to find this sword and find the great deku tree
i never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks
there are many items you can use tooi think the legend of zelda ocarina of time is even better than most playstation and playstation  games
it is just that good to meif you ever see this game in a store buy it
you will have a good time with this gamethis is truely the best game for  becuase link is so cool
this is probabaly the best zelda game
ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game
if you havent played this game i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link
not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link
this game is way better than majoros mask
if you still have  get a gamecube so you can play windwakeryou need to get this great gamethis has been deemed the bestmade game of alltime and even though its going on  years since its release i cant disagreepeople complain that this game has no replay value is too easy and the graphics arent goodwell ive revisited this game several times since it came out in  and i havent found a lack of replay value theres so many submissions i dont see how you cant think of this game as novel and new every time you replay itthis game has a perfect balance of gameplay for firsttime gamers and extra submissions for experienced ones
think its too easy
obviously you havent gotten all the heart pieces found all the skulltulas earned all the jars achieved the biggoron sword or caught the hylian loach
any one of those tasks would create a challenge for anyonecomplaining about the graphics
sorry the game isnt on xbox or playstation format
in  this game had stateoftheart graphics
as i am in the process of beating this game for a third time in  i still dont find the graphics something to complain aboutthis game excels in both gameplay and storyline
i find it hard to believe that anyone who has played at least half this game would say they hate such a masterpiecefrom a graphics standpoint this was and still is the best legend of zelda ever
the story was great as well as the gameplay
all and all this was a great homecoming for the hero of hyrule
great game from beginning to end
 starsan excellent game for those like me who like adventure and a new challenge
zelda will leave you amazed
in the game you must save your world by fighting evil monsters solving puzzles beating bosses and temples etc and getting the items and weapons etc
you need in order to achieve these and other goalsyou are the worlds last hope
can you save everyone and defeat the evil ganondorf in this breathtaking adventure gamethis game is truly phenonemonal
from the amazing graphics for what it is a n game to the music to the challenging gameplay to the engulfing storyline the legend of zelda ocarina of time is a mustplay for any age
you start the game off as young link or whatever you want to call him who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old
inside the forest there is a godly tree who could be considered to be infinitly wise
the tree senses link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising and tests him to the dungeon inside of him
link comes out sucessful and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising
from then on you play young link and must overcome many obstacles
as a child there are  dungeons and the trees counts as one so youre making some time right
wrong
theres much more to this game then beating dungeons
as a child you cant acess as many of the things but after you advance  years to the future and attain the master sword many of these things are then open to you
as a child you got an ocarina in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things
now you can do all those things and more
my personal favorite is eponas song in which you place a horses epona song and it comes to you in which you can ride across hyrule field to get to places twice as fast
as a child you have weapons like a stick whoopey a sword a shield a slingshot and duku nuts
as an adult you can handle  swords the master sword and the giant sword which is so big you must handle it with  hands which means no shield
you also have the hookshot megaton hammer bowandarrows and magic crystals you can do different things with
i cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is
id buy a nintendo  all over again just for this
now i have a playstation  and i still have my nintendo  but only play two games on it this of course and super smash brothers
now do yourself a favor buy this game and experience teh magic yourself one of the best games ever released on any console
the storyline is amazing it captivates you swiftly
the gameplay is also awesome and the graphics evil bosses etc its just one of the best games in the market
at some point we all wished to become link play a tune or two with an occarina and may day turn into night or draw towards you a horse named eponathis game rules
it was very well conceived
the storyline is good and the gameplay is awesome
i rented it before and found out it is a game to buy and play
trust me you will get your moneys worth
good graphics excellent sound scores huge worlds and good characters pull this game together
i am yet to find a game that matches its surperiority even majoras mask wasnt as good
ive beaten it several times through and sometimes wish that i didnt know it like the back of my handfirst off this game is very good considering it had very good graphics for an n and sound
second of all the storyline is the best ive seen in ages
the boy from the woods that no one knows becomes the hero of time i would reveal more but i do not want to spoil the game
third the gameplay and controls are easy to master so you probably wont be swinging your sword at an enemy when you intended to throw bombs at it like games with complicated buttons
 fourth the thing that makes zelda well zelda
the dungeons
the puzzles in them are chalenging and fun
the scenery in the dungeons and everything else is amazing
fith the enemies are unique and mystique making the worlds you explore even cooler
overall this game is the top must have of the n gaming systemsimply the best single player rpg i have ever played
from start to finish you will not be dissapointed please if u get the chance go after majores mask its also a great gameill keep this short as most people have probably already played this but when this game released in  there was literally nothing like it
no fully d adventure with the calibur of ocarina of time existed in those days
the sheer quality of this game was unheardof in  the graphics were smiply beautiful for their time and the gameplay was near perfectionyou start the game as a young kokiri boy living in the forest village with your friends and the old wise tree of life
when darkness strikes your small corner of the world its up to you to delve into the tree and find out whats truly hurting and potentially killing him
after solving the situation in your home a much broader world of discovery and adventure opens up to you and its up to you to save hyruleafter completing  childhood dungeons and playing the song of time in the temple of time you find yourself frozen in a time warp for  years waking up at age  i believe waking up in adulthood you make your way across  more dungeons before conquering the final fortress and facing one desperate final stand from the evil thats been behind all the trouble from the starttruly epic in every way considering the year it was released
ocarina of time is still the greatest game ever created in my opinionsince amazon is sort of combining ocarina of time and majoras mask into one review i will write a review for both games
both games have been remade for the gamecube and i own both the original n version and the gamecube version
the gamecube versions were released if you bought a gamecube at a certain time and if you preordered the wind wakerthe legend of zelda ocarina of timethis game started out as you as the hero of time
you were the only forest child without a fairy and the great deku tree sent the annoying little fairy to you
when you go to the deku tree he says you must get these spiritual stones to open the door of time and a bunch of other crap like thatsound and music  this game has one of the best scores in the video game world and the ocarina songs are very good
 credit to the music makers of all the zelda games these are some great songs
the only problem is you cant shut it off
sometimes it gets annoying and it doesnt help if you are stuck on a level for hoursgraphics     in this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible
if this game was released today everyone would laugh
back in  these graphics were the best out there
but the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blinddifficulty  this game is hard
i beat it barely without a strategy guide and you can be stuck on levels like the forest temple and the freaking water temple for months
if you beat the game with a strategy guide you take the challenge and fun out of it
you also wont have many broken items like controllers or tvsgameplay   it is considered the best game ever and was the  game of the year
you could do everything in this game and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap
this game is like no other
no other game can match this none of that final fantasy or any other rpg match it it is the best nintendo game ever madethe legend of zelda majoras maskthe game takes a huge turn in majoras mask as young link goes out with epona from hyrule
no ganondorfs in this game because it revolves around majoras mask a mask stolen by this little imp from the happy mask shop guy from oot
you have three days to get the mask back but you must keep going back using the ocarina and the song of timesound and music   it is like a carbon copy of ocarina of time and the suspensful music is very catchy
the game has great music all zelda games have great musicgraphics same as ocarina of timedifficulty  not as bad as ocarina of time but that doesnt mean it is not frustrating and challenging
you cant be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too greatgameplay  the whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating ganondorf like in all the other games
you will feel deja vu of ocarina of time because the characters are the same just different
the game is fun and a great challenge
overall these games are classical n greatslegend of zelda ocarina of time is a classic
it should be played by every nintendo fan and fans who are not big on nintendo
the zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them
ocarina of time is a stand alone zelda classic
it is not only the best zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console
the story line is oh so brilliant and the graphicseven for todays standard are unbelievable
anyone who owns a nintendo  needs this game
this game is pretty old and pretty cheapi lost my game so i baught one for  bucks at gamestopso it wont be hard to find
this game infact shows what the nintendo  is capable of
the game is very well made as you play through a huge worldwell not that huge  and i will say thisi may be exagerating this though but the legend of zelda ocarina of time has one of the best boss battle finale ending everubelievablegraphics in this game a superb
there were parts in the game were i would just stand there and stare at the ocean houses anything cause it looked so beautiful
i loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look
nintendo scores big with the graphics
the gameplay is magneficent
i loved how it was all made and done
i really cant get into this one youll just have to play this part for yourselfthe sound ismy godits beautiful i even downloaded all the songs
i loved the song were your in the temple and you get the mastersword cause they made that song really well
the music in the farm were epona is was made extreamly well and was just brilliant
as ive stated the story in this game is just plain good though it obviously has the save themed plot as you all know and i wont really get into the plot since there is already like  reviews saying what the plot is aboutsure the game is old and outdated i guessbut so whatthe game is still one of the greatest games of all time
ill put it in simple words for you the game is flawless
the game has an amazing plot that will suck you in the gameplay is fun and classicas well as riding epona the horseand music is just plain beautiful the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as i stated beforeocarina of time is simply the greatest video game ever madeand if its not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made no the best video game of all timeget this game you will not regret it out of 
if i could i would give it  out of this and super mario  are the best games for this console
now this was the first zelda game i ever played and its gold cartridge
now this is a zelda game thats good to bring in the newcomer or link to the past
this game is not too difficult but difficult enough
the story is one of the best stories ive seen in a video game very original
the one thing about this game i dont like are the water dungeons
its a trend in zelda games to make the levels that involve water the hardest part in the game but it is passablein conclusion good game for newcomer and the best storyline to keep you hooked on the seriesin this one of two installments in the zelda series for the nintendo  you once again take on the persona of young link or whatever you choose to name him as he embarks on a quest to save the land of hyrule from the dark forces of ganon
one of the great conflicts in nintendo history second only to that of mario and bowser
you start the quest as a boy and end up as a man
along the way you will fight many monsters explore dungeons and temples rescue a horse great for traveling through the world of hyrule quickly engage in numerous side quests and minigames learn many different tunes for your ocarina pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items meet some gorgeous fairies and in short have a wonderful gaming experienceas with the other zelda games this one is filled with different puzzles of various types most of which you must complete in order to advance in the game
they are engaging but not too difficult to figure out for the most part
there are a few though that i had a tough time with
not to fear though there is plenty of help out there both in books and on the internet to aid you through those difficult spots
the controls are wonderfully intuitive
navigating through hyrule is much like controlling mario in super mario  and the game does at times suffer from awkward camera angles like mario did and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourselfthe ztargeting system is excellent once you get used to it
you dont really need it for some of the early monsters but by the time you become an adult it will be essential
in addition you have a little fairy buddy navi who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task
navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the gameas i mentioned before there are a number of side quests throughout the game
theyre not essential to finish the game but they are a lot of fun and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier
one word of advice  when you reach lake hylia be sure and talk to the two scarecrows
later in the game you will be glad you did
also be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars
they have many useful items but they are also very expensive and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game
also be wary of gorons who want to sell you a giant sword
dont say i didnt warn youalthough you do not need a rumble pak to play the game your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one
the pak will be set off whenever link gets near a secret area which are sprinkled liberally throughout hyrule
these secret areas contain goodies that you really dont want to miss out onall in all an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the n to great effect
games like this are why i will always remain a nintendo fan
but dont take my word for it  pick it up
youll be glad you didthis game is as good as the soundtrack and majoras mask
it is one of the best ive ever playedhey all you people this game is an absolute good
barely any flaws and it is like you are playing the game in reality
this is a  star gamewhy you ask
this is the proofgameplay it takes you a while to master the controls and stuff but with practice this wouldnt be frustrating at allgraphics great
as i said everything is d like the deku tree and link himself
take a looklifespan i heard that people who knows zelda games really well could beat this in a week
but you guys out there that is starting a new adventure would last forever for no boring parts of the game
there is a lot of words to say but its worth itfunthis game is a  fun game in my opinion of course
i am stuck on the deku tree of how to get past the spiders
see challenging and funsoundyou gotta be kidding me
the sound and music is great
different sounds occur in different environments for the betterlisten closelyoverall this game is an absolute no miss game
guranteed
this is a good game who likes rpg or collects zelda games
this is i think better than majoras mask
this game follows the legend
honestlylike all zelda games the ocarina of time provides an adventure about link a young heroin the ocarina of the player takes control of a young boy known as link
right from the start of the game players jaws dropped at the sight of the graphics for  bit graphics it looks amazingas the story progresses players obtain more items and link becomes more of a hero at about  thirds through the player becomes an adult and he cant use some of his items which is one the most impressive features in a game iv ever seen
its about an ancient evil being restored and a child giving up his youth for his country theres nothing bloody wrong with this game its perfectpsthis game is why you keep your nlegend of zelda ocarina of time is one of my favorite games ever
i just love the storyline and the characterseven though link ganondorf and zelda have been in all of the zelda games but this game is the best
the original legend of zelda for the nintendo was okay but it felt like the game would never end
i recommend this game to fantasy lovers who also love the idea of a super villan an actionready hero
this is also one of nintendos classics
everything a fantasy story needs is right in this gameim not even that fari just got past those guardsbut i can tell this is a classic example of electronic excellence and is a classic that anyone lucky enough to know its out there can discoveri played this game and never wanted to stop
in my opinion this is the best rpg game ever
it is fun just to play and run around
the graphics are great and it is just plain fun
what is also nice is that getting past certain parts of levels arent very hard and you dont get upset playing itpros great graphics great plotstoryline characters look great easy figuring out what to do just plain funcons ummmzelda oct is an actionadventure rpg there is debate about this and some argue zelda is its own genre with a combination of puzzles fighting and racing
anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by oct which you can play on several nintendo platforms including the  and gamecube
i still play zelda oct  years later on the gamecube from time to time its that good of a gamegraphicsfor the time period zelda oct on the  was beautiful and it has stood the test of time far better than other older games on consoles
it was the first truly d game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like
if you grew up on newer systems and pcs these graphics will look blocky to you but the gamecube has an oct version with more refined graphics
still if you want a retro video game experience the n zelda oct has graphics that are still enjoyable todaystorythe zelda story is perfect for a video game as the basic premise is always the same
link a young boy or young man in newer games is the reincarnated hero of time
he must battle the evil ganonganondorf to save hyrule and princess zelda by using the power of the triforcezelda oct molds the zelda story into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time
the games puzzles become progressively more difficult culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon  the water temple
the story combines several races hylians kokiri gerudo gorons and zora seamlessly into one large kingdom
the enemies are varied and interesting as well
the fantasyadventure story line is complex and intricate complete with twists and shocks timetravel and genocide
time affects the characters and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails
the story details are amazingly deep to the point that pictures on someones wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character
i loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the back story by talking to the npcs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes
the main story is also amazing with the typical epic swordclashing adventure ingeniously employed in the zelda oct universe
its truly a masters greatest workgame playthe  had a simple controller for fun game play
there are only a few buttons a b z cpad r l joystick and the dpad
the dpad isnt needed in zelda  this limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations
although b always attacks and a always does an action the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do
depending on the way your character is moving and whether or not an item is targeted link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks vertical cut horizontal slash diagonal slash spin attack thrust and jump attacks
despite the fact that b z and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves link is easy to control and i never had problems getting link to perform the combination of moves i desired
link could cut any sign into  unique pieces consistently  that is excellent controller responsein addition to the perfect synchronization of link to the game controls something newer games like dark souls could take a lesson on the game play is interesting and varied
although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons
link not only totes a onehanded sword and shield but he also gets access to a sling shot and deku seeds boomerang hook shot bow and arrows bombs deku sticks deku nuts and two impressive twohanded weapons a hammer and a sword
these weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the gamesalthough the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons the game is further varied by magic
link can wield three types of hand magic as well as three types of magic arrows
this adds another level of monster fighting where link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them upapart from the impressive array of weapons link also packs a varied wardrobe
the stoic hero is far from interested in fashion i mean he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap so he obviously doesnt care about his looks so each piece has a specific use
you can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits
some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes zelda oct a great gamewait theres still more to combat
apart from the variety of moves and effects link can muster with his impressive array of items there is also horseback combat
you can ride around on epona a fierce wild mare who only listens to you and shoot things with your bow and arrow
there are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combatsummaryzelda oct is an excellent actionadventure rpg with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game
the characters are interesting with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover
the main story is fun to progress through and you care about a lot of the characters you meet
the controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun nonfrustrating game play
the bosses are challenging requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your swordfinal noteif the  is too retro for you zelda oct has been remade for the gamecube with newer graphics
however the gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the  understandably so you will miss out on a large part of what made zelda  great
additionally there is a ds version but i havent played that so i really cant commentthis is the best game i have ever playedit has very good musicgrapicsand the story is greati really love this gamebut the only really big problem with this game is that it has this onelong and boringtemple that is very hardandpleasedont take this game lightlythe bosses are hardbut the story is so good that you will want to play this game again and againbut the other zelda games are lameso only if you want tobuy this game and maybe the legend zelda a link to the past
prosthe story is greatits a fun gameand the great fairysfairys that will power you up and give you new weapons are easy to find
consswitching around the camera is a little bit hardand finding the goldskull tokensgold coin like tokens that you win from beating spider monstersis easy at the beginning of the game but hard at the end
this is a great gameso i would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy gamesi would also recommendfinal fantasyiii dawn of soulsandthe legend of zeldathe wind wakeralthough the final fantasy series was pretty good no other rpg can compare to thiswith a very long storyline and if you dont have a strategy guide handy theres a possibility that it might take a while to finish the game completelythe features are just amazing
at some points you are required to move into the future  years where link is a fullgrown adult and sometimes back  years to advance in your journey
as an adult some things will have changed
and when day turns to night and vice versa some things will change that will be different when compared to the same place only in the daytimethe battles are intense
and as for the boss battles the bosses have a variety of options that they can do and to effectively defend you usually have to be prepared for any quotcurvesquot that they throw at youlegend of zelda oot holds a lot of replay value
even after ive finished the game im still having a great timeoverall legend of zelda oot is probably one of the best rpgs available
would be definitely worth buying and would also make a wonderful giftthis is the most absolute superior game ever made
you have almost no limits as to what you can do and there is always another secret or trick you can learn
not only this but there are no limits to the fun you can have with this game
i enjoy the challenges and puzzles and new items and moves you have to get
if you are going to buy a game for nintendo  this is the game to buythinking back on the times of zelda have got me thinking
the game was absolutely breath taking i remember how fun and exciting it was and it was so good because of the challenge
if there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game please get it it is totally worth the money
then in  or  years you too can think of what a great game zelda was but then you will feel bad for neglecting your nintendo  and playing your ps but pss time for neglection will come in a few years alsoalthough i like the snes zelda best you really cant make a game better than this one
sometimes a game is made that goes above and beyond  stars
this game is like thata vast amount of items all found in unique ways
awesome
lots of giant evil bosses
awesome
lots of underground hidden stuff
awesome
lots of weird folk to talk to
awesome
time travel in a huge mythical world
awesome
lots of minigames to play for cool prizes
awesome
just so many awesome things packed into this one game
i usually only recommend rentals but a rental wouldnt do this game justice
you have to buy it you have to beat it and you have to find every secret
live this game and every now and then live it againill also recommend buying some kind of strategy guide or looking for tips online to find everything
ive heard that there is a giant monsterous eellike fish in the pond but i have yet to catch anything like thatby far one of best zelda games of all time
i highly recommend this game
well worth the moneythis is to me not only the greatest zelda game in the series but also the greatest game ive ever playwhere to begin
there is so much in this game that makes it so fun
i absolutely love the side quests
getting the biggoron sword is a race against time but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the master swordanother side quest i loved was completing the gerudo training fortress to get the ice arrows
this will force you to use all your skills and items and will really put you to the test
i would even venture to say that the gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeonthe ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience
capture all  big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop
you will get the th bottle the hardest to geteven the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique
while many wouldnt bother to complete it but the reward is the very cool and mysterious mask of truth
furthermore this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up majoras maskbut of course my favorite side quest is the skulltula side quest
it is very long and trying but definitely worth it
this is another side quest many people wouldnt bother to complete but completing it does have its merits
for example there is a very profitable rewards system in play
destroy  golden skulltulas and you get the adult wallet holds  rupees
at  you get the stone of agony which when playing with a rumble pack inserted will alert the player when a secret is nearby
at  get the giants wallet and you can carry  rupees
at  you get bombchus i know lame
at  get a piece of heart
after that you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all  golden skultullas
doing this will result in you being able to get  rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla
unlimited money is very cool although a bit useless at that late a stage in the gamethe bosses are great
i wont go into great detail but ive always loved the fight with volvagia the lava dragon
there is something so classic and satisfying about watching link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield
also the final battle with gannondorf is a real treat and i never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him
the fight has a very epic quality to it and the final battle against the horribly mutated gannon has a nightmarish ambience to itthe temples all have thier own awesome themes both musically and environmentally
i always thought that the forest temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning
it has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple and the open courtyardthe music is topnotch even by todays standards
koji kondo really put together a masterpiecethere is even a sweet element of sadness in links lost childhood with the loss of his friendship to saria
the moments where shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of timethe ability to customize adult links appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears which sword and shield to wieldin short this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heartthis game is one of the finest video games ever produced while its graphics may be some what dated by todays standards its epic story and play control are arguably better than many of todays titlesi cannot recommend this game enoughthe legend of zelda ocarina of time is the greatest game in the entire legend of zelda video game series
period
nuff saidawesome storyline awesome graphics
perfect game
great challenge but not too challenging that you cant beat it
thanx nintendo for the greateast game ever made
great game for all ages
highly recommendedthis is the best n rip
game i have ever played
its full of vast d worlds cool characters and has a deep storyline
the worlds are hugetake hyrule field a place which has absolutely nothing to do with the story but going there to get new places is soooo much fun
when you arent doing anything and are just playing around you can have hours of fun running around hunting skullkids and running from those flying spikey flower thingies
when youre an adult you can hunt poes ghosts in the field and get rewards and stuff for it
anyway the story is about a boy named link who is destined to save his home world hyrule from a powerful wizard
the wizard wants to get ahold of the triforce an ancient artifact which has the power to alter the world
he does and changes the world to a hell
link then has to go through many dungeons and meet many people and eventully save his land of hyrule and return peace
thats about it
peaceeverything a video game is supposed to be
lots visually diverse landscapes and effects intriguing gameplay and endless oppotunities for exploration within the framework of the game
no boring moments here
the horse is certainly a nice touch being a bit of a horse fanatic myself
provides a fairly lifelike representation of horse riding
nice soundtrack and the interactive music play was quite satisfying
all in all a well designed game
wish they were all this goodzelda ocarina of time is a wellmade game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles
the battles which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy are simplified by ztargeting which aims all attacks at the enemy
it takes a long time to beat months as any good rpg roleplaying game should
unfortunately it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls although theyre pretty easy in messages which you usually must read
i suggest this for all people especially those that enjoy a good challengethere always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered
zelda is one of those games its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun
i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collectionone of the best games ever on even though the  era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again theres always something you would have miss that you can find the next time aroundthis title might be the best game ever
the best title for the n it is beyond any doubts graphics i havent played much n but for all i know this is the best you can get in the plataform
beautiful enviroment landscapes welldesigned characters different places and detailed textures for this plataform
the graphics are hot i mean it
and you didnt even need graphics this game would be great even without them
this game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such d graphics plus the lockon camera this game will be forever reminded because of that
approved graphics sound this game has the best soundtrack ever if you ask me nearly every song in this game wins a  score
i really want to find a soundtrack for this game because both the ocarina songs and the ingame songs are awesome
characters dont have voices except when they scream when theyre scared and this kind of thing so the voice acting isnt great
but the sound wins a  because of the nearly perfect soundtrack fun this game touches you with a great story great characters great songs
you really feel as if you were link in the beautiful land of hyrule and that makes the game so good that you cant say its not fun
when you feel like the character you just cant stop playing even in the boring parts in other words the water and fire temples
the different times you play and the many secrets hidden i mean it many secrets i highly doubt you can get them all
makes the game even greater even more perfect educative i really dont know why this game is rated e for everyone i feel like the game has some scary parts in other words the cemitery and the shadow temple so it should be rated t for teen even though it has no great violence no red blood just green blood sometimes
but you parents shouldnt worry about that
this beauty must be taken to your childrenoverall theres nothing to say
i dont know what youre doing reading my review if you havent played this game yet
this is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime the wind waker the last game in the series is very good but it isnt nearly as good as ocarina of time
it might take a long time for you to beat it if youre always busy because the game is not short but you must try
itll be an unforgettable experience to be link in hyrulewhen the nintendo  was first introduced to the public in  the game super mario  revolutionized the gaming industry with the introduction of d gaming
however it wasnt until two years later that nintendo really perfected the d adventure genre with the release of the legend of zelda ocarina of time
ocarina is for lack of a better word a nearly perfect game in almost every sense
the graphics are great for n standards the music is fantastic the gameplay is smooth and the story is incredibly engaging
much like the mario franchise before it the zelda franchise although already somewhat established on the nes and snes took a simple character mario to zelda put him in an interesting environment mushroom kingdom to hyrule and pits him against fantastic enemiesof course perhaps the true greatness of ocarina is its balance between the essential gameplay and the sidequests
while this game added more depth riding a horse getting items that while not vital to the outcome of the game will help you etc
than any previous game in history it also wasnt too complicated see donkey kong 
in the game link has a straightforward mission and accomplishes each objective in sequenceyou only need to pursue the frivolous things if you so desirethe quirkiness of the game is also charming
along the way link meets a talking tree gets trapped inside a fishs belly befriends the rolypoly gorons and liberates temples that each correspond to some sort of natural theme forest ice water fire etc
the first time i ever played ocarina and every time since i found myself amazed by the crazy and colorful characters that nintendo came up with for each area of the gamefinally a great adventure games also needs to have an intriguing plot ie
the reason why the myst computer game series was such a big success while its clones failed which ocarina delivers superbly
right away you are drawn into the storyline that includes rescuing princess zelda defeating the evil gannondorf and bring peace to hyrule again
i know it may sound cheesy but without an engaging plot the game would have been little more than a swordslashing rpg with a few puzzles thrown inthus i recommend ocarina of time to all gamers whether young or old beginners or experts
the difficulty curve is set as such that you will be able to steadily improve your skills in time to defeat each obstacle before you while enough really challenging side quests exist that you can also hone your skills to a tee if so desired
so whether you want to fire up the old n dust off the old gamecube for which a version of ocarina was released or buy the game on the virtual console of your wii do so with confidence that you will instantly be charmed by this amazing work of video game creationthis is a great game to own i have and i beaten it  ten times and i sill play it the levels are pretty to look at the backgrounds are ok its colorful and a little rich here and thereplay through five worlds there are south pacific antarctica area  london indianew moves and vehiclesspeed dash monkey swing  kayak and quad bike help lara out of tricky situationsnew weapons like grenade launcher desert eagle rocket launcherin the game fine the ancient meteor rumored to have life giving powers

tomb raider  chronicles
tomb raider  tomb raiderthanks for readingturok  seeds of evil is the sequel to turok dinosaur hunter that not only surpasses that game in its greatness but is my most favorite game in the series of four games that came out on the n
everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon especially in the way of graphics
with the expansion pak graphics had almost a playstation  quality to them
its something that showed with this game
it showed in the textures of the environments the details of the architecture lighting effects and other eye candy
the game was also bigger and better than any other game with the exception of zelda ocarina of time in its  meg cartridge
as youve probably read in the courtesy review its been stated to have over  hours of playtime
while i dont know about that personally as i hadnt checked where i stand within the gameone thing i do know is its one lengthy meaty game to sink your teethplaytime intowhile turok  seeds of evil stood in the shadow of rares goldeneye during its release turok  still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every nintendo fan should add to their collection
if not for the fact that it had a killer storyline and an awesome arsenal of weapons to play with then for the fact it was an absolute beauty of a gamethis game is fun
the visuals are impressive and the guns are frickin cool and some fun multiplayer
play this game because you deserve something special
unless youre a dragon ball z fananyone who likes  would enjoy this game
great first person shooter
i will enjoy playing this game
the game play is a bit strange and hard to get use to because the aim and movement joysticks should be switched
the c pad on the n controller is hard to move with
great game with practiceturok  when i was younger as a kid was amazing no parents told me i was not aloud to play it because they never actually played it themselves to know
the graphical content and gore was stunning to my  year old eyes
the first level took me forever to beat and i only beat it once
plus i didnt have a controller pak
then came the day i bought it again for my n nothing looks more sexy than turok  in a green nintendo  the first time i ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only  levels
weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing
i was always able to hold as many as they would let me
such as doom turok south park armorines perfect dark etc
then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about fps
sure they have better graphics and frame rate
but they are all the same to be honest
emulators sucks ass i dont care if its rgb or not
but just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fpss are all i got
but something about the way a n looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much
to me its the best looking system and has the best looking games
turok tops it all
way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n was capable of
turok  is on pc and n
the n game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate
stencil bit shadows were a new thing in  so iguana tried it out
in my honest opinion i wouldnt have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all
still it is stunning the n could handle what was thrown at it
the ai in the game was the most fascinating thing i have ever seen in a game and still is
they are smart and fight one another really fun to watch i found the game to run best in hireslb and looks the best as well
the weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different
my favorite weapons are the tek bow shotgun warblade razorwind cerebral bore plasma rifle mag grenade launcher the kick ass charge rifle one of the best looking weapons firestorm cannon like a minigun but different and bad ass sounding nuke flamethrower the first fire to actually show d even in almost all games on n and the torpedo launcher because you can go through water faster
music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and turok  has the best music in any n game i have ever heard sorry perfect dark your music and kavenger are great to but turok is to bad ass
iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that that the music is in all turok games as well as vexx and armorines and more have some similar sound
the multiplayer in turok  to me is absolutely stunning i run that in lowres and is just as good as goldeneye perfect dark the world is not enough and turok rage wars
quite a few games ran on the turok engine as well
armorines a amazing game
uniquely different yet just as awesome and south park not many liked this game but to me its like a mixture of doomturoksouth park
the multiplayer is good to just dont go above  players
so you see turok  was used in many things and is an amazing game
once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed
they were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so
making their games unique
most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did
extreme g for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player grand prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything
extreme g to me is the best out of the series
i have almost every game by acclaim and love every game except turok  its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap
so turok  is amazing
if you want to try it get it now
on n or even on pc
you will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels
turok is the greatest fps try them all
your own risk for  but a good to the collection dinosaur hunter  amazing smooth game great n game the first fps on n
seeds of evil  worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play
shadow of oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection
rage wars the true sequel or attachment to turok  and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns
evolution fantastic remake of the first turok starring talset and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over  chapters and has awesome multiplayer
turok pcps i played it on  runs on the unreal engine which is bad ass a great game with good weapons why i liked it is because i was quick and accurate i run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like turok  but not as good and not as good music awesome multiplayer if anyone is on and a good campaign
these are the turok games
which started out as comics and became life and were playable
get turok  you will enjoy it
and bring a few friends over
it is a true turok game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy cod fansthis is a great game if you are prepared to accept that this game really wasnt meant for the n
the game has numerous slowdowns even if you have an expansion pak on the n
not everywhere but anytime there are a bunch of explosions or a whole horde of enemies are following you then you will have some sorta slowdown
now onto all the pros of this gamei witnessed this game before i played it
my friends were playing it when i was like  or so and this game scared me to death
i thought reptoids and endtrails were the scariest monsters ever
capturing children not knowing what they were going to to do to them
this game saids its rated m but you really should play this when you are a kid
its a whole lot scarier when youre a kid
not so much when youre an adult
either way this game gives off a very unsettling atmosphere
if you want a mindless shooter like the original turok this game is not for you
the antagonists actually have a story this timethe enemy ai is very realistic
the monsters react with the precise speed and vitriol that makes sensethe graphics were probably the best graphics on the n
again the n version has slowdowns but at the time these were the best graphics weve ever seen in a video game and i still quite beautiful in retrospectthis game also have a variety of very orginally designed monsters
the raptors and purrlin are still here but they are way cooler and better equiped this time
you fight genetical engineered dinosoids zombies purrlin big apelike creatures insects spiders cave dwellers the blind ones worms a fat bitch that comes near the end and even robots
all look bad ass looking and ready to kill youthe death animations are some of the best death animations ever made in the history of video games
in this game you litteral can blow someones head off or a limb or a whole torsothe weapon choice is also top notch
im sorry but the cereberal bore was the coolest weapon ever thought of
thats just my opinion
theres just nothing better than locking onto an enemies head shooting a bore the bore drains the cereberal fluid and then explodes when it reaches the center
coolest weapon ever made
the razorwind is also cheap as helli really can go on and on about how good this game is
this is probably my favorite fps next todoom both which are tied for firstafter playing turok the dinosaur hunter for ten minutes i realized i had a great game at hand
it was like mortal kombat except in a shootinggame
blood everywhere amazing enemies and weapons and a good good time
and ill admit this i dont actully play the turok games
no im sorry i dont
its not that their hard or boring but i dont play themwell not without the cheats at least
as soon as i find out a new turok games coming i get on the internet go to happypuppycom and find the master cheat
yeah its pretty low but its fun to go in these bloodsoaked shooter games
and the second one is no exception
i played this game without cheats for a few hours made up my mind and decided it was great and would be even better with cheatshalf an hour later i came back with the master cheat in my hand which is bewareoblivionisathand or if you break it down beware oblivion is at hand
within minutes i had an amazing arsenal all maps invincibility and more by my side
the weaponswell lets just say the first turok cant touch them
you have the usual knife and bow and arrow pistol shotgun and the rest but you now also have a nuke pod layer which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact a machine gun as the first had but this ones much better the cerebrial bore the most gory weapon of all
it launches out a little ball and it goes straight for the enemies head
when it gets there it starts sucking and draining blood form their head then after  second it explodes and takes the enemies head with it my personal favorite the razor wind a shield with sharp edges on it
you throw it and it cuts up all enemies in its path then come right back to you
it can chop off just about any limb you throw it at the head the legs and the arms and another physical weapon the war blade
the name says it alloverall this game is a vast improvement and is the best yet but that might change as soon as i play evolution
the graphics are great awesome story vast detailed enviroments and some hot blue chick that always pops up
what more could you ask forwhen i heard about turok  comming out i was so friggin phycedi wasnt dissapointedit was even bettter than the first
it wasa little sci fi for me though
and what was up with turokhe looked so young
i really didnt get the story
if you get the cheats its even better
even more awsome weapons for you touse
you kick alien ass and take namesthis is one of my favorite sequals for a video gameits very original
the game is frustrating without cheats butits really fun and cool
its pretty much as violent as thefirst onei love this gamegreat graphicsgreat gameplaygreat storykina confused with turok bein youngover allits a great gameway to go acclaimno idea to say about that have same with twisted metal  and twisted metal small brawl i havent play for long timei believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games
seek out enemy kill and move to the next level and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others
also the levels are locations that we all reconciles so that adds to the fun
i like twisted metal  because they brought more of a d look to cheaters locations car weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line
yes the graphics are not all out there however the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning
if you love twisted meat at all you will love this one
i have played all twisted metal games and for the most part i do like them all
and this one i really do like very muchthank you for having this game and in its good conditionyou have increased my collection of games by onehow can anyone not like this game
i dont know about you guys but i still like to play this as weel as twisted metal  even though i just got an  i will still play this wheneverworks just fine
old school just the way it should be
a huge improvement from twisted metal ii
still old school graphics but it still is fun to playthis is one old school fun game to fight against your friends
you can not create any thing
hours of fun from royal rumble to regular matches and there is quite a bit of people to play asthis is and was the best wrestling game ever and the big bonus is its wcwnwo not wwe so all the wrestlers are awesomethqs second american release is a huge leap in graphics from the original world tour dozens of wrestlers from the nw wcw ravens flock cruiserweights heavyweights and some of which are made up for the game
the great thing about this game is it was back in wcws hayday when it had talented wrestlers like jericho benoit malenko and raven more talent means more moves more moves means more fun
the only real modes other than battle royals and handicapped matches are a series of championship tournaments to go through in a specific weight  talent class
there are incredible looking arenas even with an isle to brawl in and weapons that you can pull from the crowd and bring into the ring
the unfortunate part about this game is that it is dated and it moves very slowly compared to wrestlemania and no mercythis is my all time favorite wrestling game ever made i really enjoy this game alot the modes you have are exhibition tag team special matches like  on  you have also a  player battle royal which to me is my all time favorite feature in this game what so ever winning the titles in this game is alot of fun and to me this game is alot better than the overrated smackdown here comes the pain and it is alot easier than that game as well i dont get why people say smackdown here comes the pain is so great when in reality it sucks because the ai in season mode is very cheap and i hate ai like that but in this game on easy mode the ai is way to easy but to me this game is just awesome and i still play this game alot to this day i never get tired of itgreatest wrestling game ever to this day
not only does it feature the best wrestlers from the greatest time period in all of wrestlings history but that greatness translates into the game
fun and very real controll like features
cant say enough how great the game isi remember when this game first came out
it was mind blowing as to just how awesome it was
it had basically anyone  everyone youd ever want in a wrestling game minus some legends
and if you had  controllers   friendsit was going down for hours
well this game is still pretty cool despite its age
the
graphics obviously dont look as awesome as they used to
but still they could look worseand the gameplay is still easy to pick up  enjoy
infact i wish the wrestling games of today could get the controls simple  fluid as on this n game
if they could remake this game w an expansive create a playerwrestler and simple controls
id easily buy that too
i highly recommend this to anyone that is a game collector
or anyone who hasnt played games of this era but are getting older games
there is a crap load of characters cool match modes
and as i stated earlier get controllers  some buddysgreat game one of the best of n next to paper mario and zelda oot ofcourse anyway buy it if you have a n and also get wcw nitro for ps anyway buy this and nitro and thunder all for psi loved this game when it first came out and to this day its one of my favorites
the wrestlers most of them anyway have a whole lot of moves and they are not all the same for every wrestler
the inclusion of the real wrestlers signature moves is very cool
one of the things i especially like about the game is the number of wrestlers on it
there are  of them  thats a lot more than a lot of later wrestling games have
a few of them are locked at the start but theyre not really that hard to unlock  at least not with the difficulty level on easy
several wrestlers who were later on the legends games hogan macho man sting bret hart steiners and others are here
some of the wrestlers are madeup or at least i assume they are
the graphics are good
the wrestlers are blocky but the real wrestlers faces are very realistic
the play control is very good  a lot better than the play control on world tour
the man battle royal is really cool
there are several different arenas which is kinda neat but in my opinion doesnt really do that much for the game
the sound effects and music are in my opinion not great but good enough
the wrestlers dont have individual entrance music but oh well  no biggie again my opinion
there is no commentary but thats fine with me because i always turn off the commentary on games anyway
one of my fave game features is the costume change mode
this mode lets you take wrestlers and put other wrestlers outfits on them and lets you edit the colors of the outfits
thats fun i think so anyway
you can even change the wrestlers names but why would you ever really want to do that unless maybe somebody like giant has changed their name in real life
there isnt much if anything about this game that i have any major complaints about
sure its dated now but i still find it as fun as i did back in  i think thats when it first came out
just because something is old now that doesnt mean it isnt still goodi loved the first and second tomb raiders and this one is just amazing
i love the story the graphics are good the gameplay is really easy and its relatively easy
i know that many people say that this game is way too hard but there seriously mistaken its really not that hard
its much like the other tomb raiders
i still play it its such a good gameget this if you liked the other tomb raider games
and pay no attention to the reviews that give this game  or even  stars
just stick to that s and the soh one more little thing if you have vista or a laptop you may have some sound effect problems but it usually fixes itself after you play it for a few hoursfor those of you who havent played super mario  i would like to say on behave of all of us that have your truly missing out
super mario  was the very first video game i ever played on my nintendo  so my review could be a little biased but i just recently replayed the game from start to finish and it still has not lost its touch
its a game for people that love adventures puzzles shooting and the occasional flying
it never seizes to get old and the graphics are as good as they can get for the nintendo the object of the game is simple bowser has kidnapped princess peach and you mario the greatest plummer in the world must save her
bowser is hiding somewhere in the castle and you must find him by collecting all of the hidden stars scattered throughout various paintings that give mario his power
to find bowser you must climb to the top of the tower
each floor requires a certain number of stars that have to be collected before you can move on
every painting that has stars in them are magical paintings that mario can jump through to transport himself to a different world were he can explore for starsoverall i rank the game a  for its creativity and several different ways it keeps players focused and entertained
the makers of mario did a fantastic job integrating so many different aspects of gaming which in turn made it so great
i hope that whoever is reading this can come to their senses and buy this gameeven though this game is almost  years oldit is still one of the best games that the n has to offer
why
well dear reader i will tell you why
super mario  is a gaming revolution  it was the game that everyone had to have
it took mario into a whole new atmosphere
the world that is inside princess peachsaka princess toadstool castle is immense and highly imaginative
although the graphics may seem a little bit datedit was a launch game remember that it is still a sight to see
as far as play control goes it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving mario around but once you get used to it then controlling mario is a breeze
in fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer
the super mario  storyline is familiar to mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing
yes peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castlein a picture in fact and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside
one of my problems is that luigi is not in the game in fact no mention of him is made either
nintendo should have left the mario party franchise alone and focused on creating a super mario   but alas they didnt
so if you own a nintendo  and dont have this title or are thinking of buying a n then get super mario  because it is by far a true gaming experience was a fairly important year in the realm of video gaming
the super nintendo entertainment system dies out in the united states
diablo comes out for the pc
however the biggest news is the launch of nintendos amazing new system the nintendo  which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controllertwo games were released along with the system
there was pilotwings  which was not exactly what was expected but the other game was called the greatest game of all time as of  that is at least in the eyes of critics by several source
and it really wasthe first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy
the first thing that pops out at you after the title is giles goddards mario face
and boy does it look good
but enough with the intro
its time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics testanswer
yes it does
even after five years super mario  is still one of the most beautiful games for nintendos crowning glory speaking from a fanboys pov
the character and tree designs are very outdated by todays standards but the water is still lovely though surpassed and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that i have ever seen
today the graphics would get a c by reviewers but back in  this game would get an abut who cares how it looks
lets see how it soundsthe answer
great
before  nintendo fans never had a chance to hear mario talk but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words itsa me mario
and hello
while a remixed version of the classic mario theme plays in the back
but again this is only the intro
the question is whether games sounds that goodthe answer naturally would be even better
mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including mama mia
 here we go
and press start to play
unfortunately everything else other than peach and bowser dont talk in anything else other than words
but remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game and if people complain for zelda then they shouldnt complain herethe music and sound effects are just divine
outside the castle you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall
enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing
each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber
the bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music and its all wonderfulnow that the graphics and the sound are out of the way lets get into the meat of the game the gameplaythe first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional mario games
there are only up mushrooms and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning
however super mario  is d and most of those elements just wouldnt work in a d gamethe story according to the manual is that peach invites mario over to the castle for a cake
when mario reaches the castle he is greeted with a gruff voice
wondering what went on mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in
there he finds himself in a new world with a giant bobomb on the top
he fights and defeats it youll have to do that part yourself and gets a star
later he learns that bowser has attacked the castle captured the princess stolen the power stars and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings then the world itselfyeah so it isnt much different from other mario games but thats not the point
the point is there are  stars out there although  is need to beat the game but wheres the fun in that
for you to collect
your misson to explore  worlds to find those  starswell instead of having a super mario and a mario like in past mario games mario has  life bars
hitting certain enemies would make him lose  life bars as well falling from semihigh heights
burning marios butt will make him lose  certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose  but dont worry
coins and water will replenish your health
if you lose all  or fall down a pit you lose a life
but for every  coins you get with a star and every up mushrooms you get a lifeyour moves include the standard running punching buttstomping as well as the kick the longjump the wallkick the sidesomersault and the backflip
you can also swim
there are three special caps that gives you special abilities
the flying cap gives you the ability to fly
the metal cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy
the vanish cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls
mario most employ all of those ablities to save the princess and the worldthe nintendo  controller with its analog stick makes it possible for mario to perform the tasks successfully
just imagine travelling in a d world with a dpad
some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the cbutton
it may be annoying at first but eventually youll get used to it and itll come naturally and youll learn to play with the bad anglessuper mario  not only has good graphics good sound and good gameplay but the fact that it is revolutionary in that it brings gaming into the d world makes it not only the best game of  but possibly also the best game ever
thats right even better than castlevania and super metroidsuper mario  is a great game and is what i would call the best platforming game of all timepros memorable music and imaginative courses game play is always straightforward and never confusing  stars to collect for long playing time graphics were great back when it was made and is not painful to look at nowcons while this game does have replay value you arent compelled to play again after you beat it
give it a while and you will definitely want to play againthis game was not too hard for me and i beat it when i was in the singledigits as a child
that given it shouldnt be too hard for any age
buy this game now if you havent ever played it since it is one of those video games you have to beati only bought a n recently but played it numerous times at friends houses
ive already got a ps with  games and  for the n and have played god knows how many others but i have to say that super mario  is on my top  listthis game was the premiere launch game for the nintendo  when it premiered and despite the fact that it is only a single played game pulls off fun gameplay and great graphics
despite the fact of newer systems like xbox ps and even nintendos own gamecube i would still be happy to have this game sitting on my shelf next to games like red faction and halo
this game prved itself showing off the power that the nintendo  had and showed it off to the loyal people who bought one instead of a psx and even those who like me bought both a nintendo  and a psx
but not to mince words ill explain the game
you are mario one of the most well known characters in video game history
you play through this adventure all in d
this was one of the true selling factors of this game as it was marios first true step into the third dimension hushed gasp
but the game sold great and over time has proved in its own right that it is a classicsuper mario  is a game ive wanted to play for ages
i finally decided to purchase it and i was not disappointed
in my opinion super mario  is the best in the mario series and one of the best games ever
this game was a breakthrough in dplatformers and its easy to see why
the d is great for its time and the style is incrediblethe game is addictive as well
i would play for hours and hours and wouldnt want to stop and super mario  does not get tiresome after you beat it for the first timethe plot is simple bowser kidnaps princess peach and mario must save her
but the plots not important in a video game
the game play is what mattersthe game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock
despite not having any other areas to go to outside of princess peachs castle there are tons of areas inside
getting to new areas is simple
you need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors
overall there are  stars in the entire game and i would recommend a guide because of how challenging it iswhen battling bowser in this game i was disappointed
hes so easy
when i beat him the first time i was surprised how easy he was
it was more difficult getting to bowser than it was battling him
but all three incredible boss stages that were before the battles are so much fun it makes up for itthere are also hidden items characters and power ups for mario to findnow there are a few problems like any other game that i think are quite frustrating
marios controls sometimes are a little tough
his wall jumps have to be so precise and if you mess up you have to do it again and again and the camera sometimes can be tough to use in certain areas
but despite these problems its still a great gamethis game is a must own for mario fans
while yet you must already know this since im writing this review thirteen years later
 super mario  will always be known as one of the best dplatformers in video game historyi grew up playing super mario  if you are considering buying this game dont hestitate or think twice
this game is really fun
it can keep you entertained for hours
the graphics are simply stunning even by todays standards considering the age of this game
it is a classic must have for any n players mario fans or video game fanaticssuper mario  was the first game to be available for the n
i remember the first time it came out how its graphics music and gameplay really amazed me
sadly very few games came after it to give much competition
to this day it still remains one of the best n games out there
the sheer scope of the game is enough to pick it up
its made up of  levels that can be played in a seminon linear order
the graphics are bright and clear and the animations are creative for each character
gameplay is pretty deep but extremely intuitive and becomes second nature after playing for a short time
the real plus in this game is the music some of the most catchiest to be written for a game to date
pick this one up for both its historical value and for the fact that its a great gamethis game is coooooollll
me abigail has this game and i have  stars
they were soo easy to find
i do not know how i became an expert at this
for your information i am an expert in all of my video games
i must feel like the luckiest girl in the world
but ill give you a little infotitle rainbow ride staryoull have to take another magic carpet ride through lowflying areial obstacles to reach the cloud house
the blue blocks that float in your way are bigger on this carpet ride and youll have to jump on them quickly before the carpet moves out from under your feet
the magic carpet will take you through the cloud house twice
on both trips whatch out for the jet of fire that comes out from the fireplace
its best to stay to the rear of the carpet until the fire is out then go to theleading ledge of the carpet
if you get knocked off the carpet its a log trip back to a spot where you can remount it
 theres a warp to the top of the maze on the cloud house balconystill the best d game on the market
challenging tons of fun levels and amazing gameplay
a true model for d gameswhen i first played super mario  as a kid i was amazed
i never even had the game though
heck i never had a nintendo  this game like many other nintendo  titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a nintendo   years after its release
i used to play this game with friends and cousins
playing it now brings back such great memories
this game is what a game is all about
an unforgettable story an interesting environment and overall fun
this game doesnt get old
in my opinion it beats out most modern games today
super mario  formed the basis for all dimensional video games
if you were considering getting this game dont consider any longer
get iti dont know how many times ive played this game from start to finishlike a lot of people my decision to buy a n was based on the mario  commercialsthe wow factor was in full effectwhen i got home and started playing it literally felt like the first time i experienced atari or the sega genesisblown away would be an understatementthe game itselfperfection even with a few minor thingsthe goodm ushered in a whole new age of platformingbrought us d platfroming that was just about perfect in every waythe graphics for its time were second to nonethe control was spot onthe story line was simple but cute like all mario gameshidden secrets like being able to wall jump up to the roofi could go on and onthe badmy only gripe is the camerathe camera can get quite wonky in places and funnyeven to this day bad cameral angles still plague d gamesnintendo and other companies have for the most part gotten the camera down with the free moving camera feature
too bad some companies are still completely cluelessto summarizeperfectiongroundbreakinga legend that spawned a thousand imitators some good mostnot so goodcant beat the originalhighest recommendationsthis is an amazing game
one that you can enjoy playing from the start to the finishthis game is excellentthis game has state of the art graphics for its timeand it still looks perfect now in you must own thisi got this game many years ago for the n and i just loved it
the game presented a large challenge while at the same time made it very fun
the music is the best heard in a game the graphics are superb for an n title and this mario game is a blast
i guess the most noticeable feature are the environments that the game provides
every environment that mario enters is just awesome
i especially love the rainbow level and the snow level where all of the penguins are
the best feature is the fact that every age group can enjoy the hours of entertainment from the game and they can all enjoy collecting stars from each stage to save peach and defeat bowser
oh by the way the bowser levels are awesome
fighting bowser himself is very fun as well
the game is also good in the fact that it provides unsatirical yet not stupid humor as well
this is great for younger gamers
i guess the worst part of super mario  is the lack of replayability
its like vice city where it will take months to play and finish the game but once its done you wont want to play it again without getting bored
once the rides over youll feel like you cant go play it each day and the game is kind of wasted in that aspect
overall if you are a fan of mario or nintendo then this game may just be suited for your needs
my ratingthis game was a very fun game
you basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings each one leading you into a different world and in every world you have to find  stars one of em is the  coin star where you need to collect  coins then it pops up its the hardest star to gettheres  worlds in all most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it this game right here is history its one of nintendos biggest hits and when you buy this game youll soon find out whythe best game for the nintendo  is this
yhis game rocks really it does its one of the best n game i have ever played i thought i already rated this but i just love amazon dont you
even the reviews are hilarious that i found on youtube and go on smosh on twittergood game for its time period kinda miss the old  graphics
the cartridge came before its due date and it works wonderfully
thankswhen i first saw super mario  in  i had to pick my jaw up off the ground
while  years have passed i still consider this game of the finest pieces of entertainment i have ever seen
the kinds of things that the development team pulled off in the mid s set the stage for all future video game development and it was is and always will be groundbreakingan achievement that should not be ignored and is still as much fun today as it was a decade decade
ago
 highest possible recommendationthe d age began when mario was in d
a gem for ngraphics  for a  game these look great
its clear and unfuzzysoundmusic  nice music and mario talksgameplay  mario has to go through  vast challanging worlds
packed with a huge arsnel of moves he searches for power stars in a mission there are also hidden stars in the castles
if you get all  you get a reward
also mario has three cap powerups invisibility metal and winged
you have to find them thoughbelieve it or not i think this is one of the finest entries of the series
a must own
its also being rereleased for the dsit was incredible to see this game when it came out in  my brother and i had our minds blown
we lived in this game and mario kart and thought entertainment would never be the same
years ago this was the one word on videogames it revolutionized everything and no one has duplicated it
a mustown and play
itsjust incrediblethis game was one of my favorite games on the none of  or anyway this game is stunning graphicly for its time and the gameplay is a blast and challengingyou can find this game on any emulator sitecheck it outsuper mario  is a classic pure and simple
and theres not much else i can say
its a really good game with alot of stuff thats fun to come back and do
you can fly around with your wing cap or slide down a huge sliding board of ice
mario  is pure classic pure funthis is a top classic mario game
i would highly recommend getting it if you love the mario series
very good gamei stand behind this game being the best super mario game nintendo has produced
too bad it was on a system that people didnt enjoy  too many complaints over the control and the game selection and graphics capability it was a true underdog
but super mario  has so many good qualitiesthis game takes forever to beat
some may think this is a nusance but its filled with many many wonderful levels of funeach level is unique and its organized in a wonderful fashion you never get too confused in nagivating the gamethere is always something new to find and many races and somewhat minigames that are actually entertaining and not ultimately annoy youyou get frusterated when you lose you realize this isnt some easy game  you can breeze through its actually difficult  appreciate that challenge because challenge is hard to come by in games these daysgraphics arent overdone
good you can find flaws especially these days the angles may alert some gamers as being old fashioned but think about it like this its not d
loloverall i love this game
without a doubt i consider it amongst the top  of my favorite games
if you havent played this game you are really missing out on something go play it youll see how fun and exciting this game can be
and believe me  it only gets betterthe original party game
the nostalgia that this game brings back makes it a must buyone of the best games of all timesso what is marios quest this time
save the princess peach by defeating the evil bowser while collecting  stars in only  levels all  levels are contained in  huge castle
it might not be the best mario game but it offers a new d world and a whole new realism
it also has new features such as an energy feature where rather than collecting powerups like the fire flower you now collect a gold coin and you get a block of energy back
now mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies he can now throw punches kicks and slide into enemies making full use of the d plane
the enemies come to life in d such as huge chain chomps menacing goombas and annoying koopas the graphics could have been better because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have
the music and sound effects are nice because mario now has a voice to be heard
there are however only minimal powerups such as marios winged hat which allows him to fly and marios steel cap making him invinciblei dont think i really need to tell you why this game is amazing if you have played it you already knowin these decades of the digital world with superior hardware and high definition graphics i dont believe gamers will ever encounter the same life changing experience as those who have first hand seen mario evolve into a d masterpiece
the nintendo  is the best console of its time hands down
and super mario  is a masterpieceprobably the most epic of the first generation of d platformers and certainly one of the most wellknown
with  stars to collect you can spend quite a bit of time working up the perfect game
just dont go for that unlocking luigi nonsense
it was all an urban legendheres a cool trick
you have to have the nd key you get from bowsertopicsnowman has your hatsent in fromanubisget your blown off by the big snowman
dont pick your hat up at all
instead go get a star it dosnt have to be a new starand save and turn off n
wait  secondsnow turn n back ongo back to that level and one of the little snowmen that pops out of the snow will have marios hat on their headwhere are all the green pipes
why is there no coin counter for running around the castle
there are coins all over the place
i want to collect a  coin castle star
did you even think before you sent this to production bro
is this even this games final form
the cake was a liei have been playing video games for years
my first console was the original nintendo and then the super nintendo followed by the nintendo  super mario  came out when i was about  years old and it was an instant hit
super mario  was the greatest super mario game of them all
my nephew has a nintendo  and he wants some new games for his birthday
i thought whats better than super mario  i bought this for his birthday and he will love it
i would recommend super mario  to anyone who wants to play a fun and family oriented mario gamei love this game its the best mario game on nintendo  it is fun and everyone would love playing this gamethis is one of the best games ever made for the n consoleit will always be a reminder of my younger years and my kids love itthis is a change of pace for mario
its d and you have to do tons of missions for each levelwhile this adds depth do the game it can also make you really frustratedespecially because the n controllers are so awkward when you go to a mission and its really difficult to complete it
my advice is that you should take a break from that level and play an easyfun onei wish this game didnt have so many jumping styles though
mario sunshine is a thing for us to look forward to but will at be an actionadventure game like this one
is bowser even in itwe dont know yet
the one thing we do know is that the game cube controller is easier to use than the n one and that the new mario games guide will be easy to look for
while i still say super mario bros  is the most fun mario game of all time this one comes close
i prefer sonic adventure though
im not even all that good at most video games including mario but even i can tell that mario  is a classic just because the levels ive completed were so fun and still arethis is so classic and we love it
dont forget to buy a rumble pack so you can feel when you crash or go over the railroad tracksthis game is really good
it was the launch title for the nintendo  its a full d world
the objective of the game is to collect the power stars in princess peachs castle to get to the top of the castle to fight bowser and save the princess
 stars out of the  are required to face bowser
this game is really big too you can fly turn invisible and go through certain types of walls and turn into metal
the game is really good and i would recommend this to anyone who has a n
if you dont have a n you can get it from the virtual console service on wii for about  bucksone of my all time favorite games for the nintendo 
i missed playing this and finally ordered the game just to feel the nostalgia ha
the game works perfectly and i feel like a little kid again fighting bowser dthis game is great and fun to play
they are many powers that you can get like flying and so on
the color of the background is alright
the color looks smooth and rich and brightthere are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find
in order to fine them look very very hard you never know a star could be under your nosethe levels are cooler and better than the other old mario games that i playden in a long timethe levels can be very very hot or very cold places or the levels can have water so you have to swim
or some of the levels can be nice or normalin the game mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on
in the levels you dont get one star there are many stars in one level
each level has many stars to fine
get the stars and be very very powerfulmy nephew is having a blast playing mario again
thank you he plays it all the time after school its hard for me to take him away from the gamesuper mario  is one of the most amazing games ive ever played
in fact its my second favorite game of all time next to super mario galaxy
you get to explore the large levels freely and do most of the levels in any order you want
gameplay and controls are simple and easy to pick up  but theyre very fun
not only do the good graphics look d but the music also sounds d
some things in this game are just too great for words its easily the game of the decade for the s easily beating out super mario world the second best which is amazing
this game is far supirior to that overrated zelda ocarina of time
i rate this game 
its perfectthis great game is commonly overshadowed by the inferior n zelda games
if you have the n without this game what are you waiting for
buy this game
super mario  has great gameplay sound effects music graphics and an excellent intro to top it all offsuper mario  one of the greatest games for nstoryplot the story begins with a letter from princess peach inviting mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him
however when he arrives mario discovers that bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castles  power stars
many of the castles paintings are portals to other worlds in which bowsers minions keep watch over the stars
mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars
he gains access to more rooms as he recovers more power stars and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses each leading to its own battle with bowser
defeating bowser the first two times earns mario a key for opening another level of the castle
after mario defeats bowser in the final battle peach is released from the stainedglass window above the castles entrance
peach rewards mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised himgameplay each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits
the worlds are filled with enemies that attack mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance offer information or ask a favor such as pink peaceloving bobomb buddies
the player gathers stars in each course some stars only appear after completing certain tasks often hinted at by the name of the course
these challenges include defeating a boss solving puzzles racing an opponent and gathering coins
as more stars are collected more areas of the castle hub world become accessible
the player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating bowser in special courses
there are many hidden minicourses and other secrets to the game most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely
some courses contain cannons that mario can access by speaking to a pink bobomb buddy
after entering a cannon mario can be shot out to reach distant places
when the player has the wing cap equipped cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quicklythe gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then power ups some courses have special cap powerups which augment marios abilities
the wing cap allows mario to fly the metal cap makes him immune to most damage allows him to withstand wind walk underwater and be unaffected by noxious gases and the vanish cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damageabilities mario can wall jump long jump and many moremusic the music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage
in short super mario  is a great game and it deserves respectthis game is a must get in your video game collection
this game also started the trend where super games have  in their name for example donkey kong  super mario kart  pilotwings  and super man story  gameplay  music  powerups  overall   athe kids play this game at least once a week since theyve had it so yes its worth the moneythis is everything i thought it would be
it was the first game i got when i got my n and it was greati played this game when it first came out at a friends house but i never bought it
i was not that in to the  back then
but now i think it is very fun and entertaning
the graphics r good for the  including that it was the first game ever for it
that is why almost everyone who has a  has this game
if u take the snes newest games graphics compared to this game which is only a couple years apart these graphics seem life like
it has a great adventure but its weird that luigi is not in this game
it adds much more new itemscharectersand levels
i like that it is first person view unstead of the side view like on the past marios
ever since this game most marios have been first person view
this is why i want sm ds it is like the s but different graphics and differnent layouts
i will get the ds one in the future but thats a different story
like i said my top favorite game todayokay so when i decided i wanted to buy a new nintendo  my brain automatically said now where can i find super mario
hours upon hours were spent on this game when i was a tweenager and i had so much fun with it
so i went out as soon as i could and bought it againi was kind of worried because i had gotten some games with my system that i used to this were fun also but they ended up being a little too easy since im older now but when i got this and played it it was exactly the same
some easy levels and some that take forever to get through but in a good wayi have had it for a month now and havent gotten bored with it yet
so i recommend this game to people of all ages
i even let my  year old brother try it out and he had a blast even though he had no clue how to really navigate buy itits a great game but you can get the same thing on your ds for a lot cheaper  so if you like portable devices get it on your dsokaythe game is very addicting
the soundgraphicsgameplay is all great
but i discoverd something else funer
super mario  ds
that game is way better
this game is good but that game is something you cant keep your eyes off
remember when you finish the game and eyerything to do and theres nothing left to do well this ds game has mini games
they are very addicting and fun
you can draw on this as well
the adventure mode takes longer folks
you can play as yoshiluigimario wario
in the beginning of super mario you could just walk in
but thwe ds version is different
you have to collect a rabbit to get in
there is more rooms in this castle too with more levels
instead of collecting  stars
you have to collect  if you dont have enogh money for a ds and the game but have a ndust off the original and have some fun
or go out and buy your ds and game
get whatever
you have to play this though
if you dont think im rightthen you will be sorryi think mario is a  great game
fighting bowser is the funnest part in this game
the best part is when you see yoshi
yoshi gives you  lives
its fun looking for marios cap when mario loses his cap
the game is one of the first d and is very good game for n
even thoughgamecube has the best graphics the game is very graphical gamethe game may have many challenges even after you get  stars
this mario game is very fun for n and i have to say this is one of the greatest hits ive ever had for nhello again friends
what bad can be said about mario 
the polygons are smooth as silk very very very rare slowdown and the mario we know and lovecan anyone guess what plumbers job is in this game
its to traverse  levels in search of princess peach
on the way you have to stomp on bowsers head
thrice
all your favorite enemies are back with the exception of koopa troopas
the goombas shy guy the lakita brothers the moles bobombs everyones backat a graphics standpoint super mario  is absolutely outstanding in every way shape and form
kudos to nintendo
 out of  for graphicsa great soundtrack and a great mario voice make for a great overall sound
 out of  for soundthe huge worlds will keep you coming back for more
there is no way to put this thing down
 out of  for replaythe final score
go look at the starssee ya later
go buy this game
merry christmas
luv yai didnt use to be into mario or kirby but now i like them both as much as i like the legend of zelda series i still have many more games to purchase based on those  characters
but i think supermario  is a great story game a killer for the old games meant for the gameboy
so enjoygreetings i am oklonia
my review of super mario  is right heresuper mario  is a game that all master n gamers have to owni dont even need to tell the story
whats happened
the same traditional story bowser kidnaps princess toadstoolmario finds the princess rescues her and destroys bowsercapcisethe courses and stars names are quite creative
eg
lil penguin lost they are more riddles thoughthe graphics are so sharp looking and realistic that maybe just a few could go on gamecube
gcndespite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode super mario  is really superthis has been okloniaquotsuper marioquot is arguably the most successful and most recognizable brand name in the history
it seems that every time nintendo releases a new episode in the series it hits video gaming gold
from the earliest release of the original quotsuper mario brothersquot on the original nintendo entertainment system it has always been a hit
even lesser known titles in the series like quotsuper mario world  yoshis islandquot stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay
with the dawn of nintendos three dimensional  degree rotating platform nintendo  the question became quotcould nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give mario a fresh anglequot  the answer in the form of quotsuper mario quot proved to be a quite emphatic quotyesquotquotsuper mario quot takes the technique of multiple goals for each level introduced in quotsuper mario worldquot and expands it in a quite impressive manner
there are  worlds mario must navigate in an effort to free the princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle
the goal is to accumulate at least  stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with bowser
as each world contains  stars of its own in addition to  bonus stars around the castle it would seem to be a walk in the park
however all is not as it seems
several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements
therefore there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with bowser are won
of course this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were mario travels the depths of the ocean soars in the open sky battles over scorching lava and even gets to sneak through a haunted house
the variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing as are the new moves mario can make to help accomplish these goals
no longer content to just move forward and jump mario can now do backflips long jumps wall leaps and crawlsone other aspect of quotsuper mario quot that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track marios movements through each world
it takes some getting used to but it enables a truly three dimensional feel
this is game that nintendo built its release of nintendo  around
it delivered magnificently then and with its continual replay value still delivers todaysuper mario  was and still is one of the best and most revolutionary video game ever made
the game was a launch title for the nintendo  and boy did the game make its mark on the console
sure we have games like banjoe kazooi ocarina of time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffslike many people say banjoe kazooi was a ripoff but i didnt say that so dont flame me
but thats beyond the point this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever
when super mario  launched with the n it was indeed a very revolutionary game it was the first game to present d platforming state of the art graphics and some of funnestbest gameplay youll see in platformingaction games
the game is huge
in mario  you will be going through many many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save princes peach
i was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the nintendo  and when you compare it to todays games the gameto many but not melooks terrible but you gotta understand the time this game was releasedit was infact the best looking video game everperiodand even today when i play this classic it still looks amazing
call me crazy but i seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid s but even today it is still marvalous
the music in mario  was just plain perfect the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting words cannot explain how well miyamoto and nintendo did for the musicits just plain good
the controls are also tight and well focused i especially love the array of moves mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once
as for camera yes there were times were i wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good
audio controls graphics are all a and as for gameplaywell it dependsdo you like platformingactionexploringcollecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole gamestars duuhhhand if the answer is yes then this may be the best game youve ever played
now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative i never got bored once in this game
its so fun hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting
speaking of difficulty the game is perfect its not hard nor is it easy like pieacctually i take that back for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plotbut it just gets it right on difficulty i dont remember ever being frusraited or angry with the gamethen again i never did try to get all  starsand just having a great time with the gameit seriously is one of the funnest experiences ive ever had with a game and as i said beforethis game is revolutionary
now that im done ranting and talking about this game ill just get to it quicklythe goodone of the best and most revolutionary game everperiodback then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever madeloads of things to donot hard but not too easy its juuuust about rightthe game is just plain fun the moves the platforming collecting ectcollecting stars is really funthe music in this game is just plain fun to listen to
though the bosses are easy i still think theyre just classicswill take a very long time to get all  stars and collecting  stars means spending lots of time with this amazing titlethe worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look atthe badsome may feel that game is feeling abit dated nowthe game is pretty old now
some will find the graphics to be terrible or just bad which i find hard to believepeople who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els shouldnt even touch the gamebecause the game doesnt take too long to beat for plot and if youre planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with whats the point of that
some will be angry with the cameraalot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river if you want a hardboss go play something elsother then that get ready to play one of the best games everoverall super mario  stands up on its own
the game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventurelike plot with lots of collecting to do
the games music was just great to listen to the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the movesmechanics that are enabled for mariothough limitedare great
the game is just plain great
as i stated before it is one of the best video games ever made and it indeed gets a perfect out of  starsthe mario series from nintendo has consistently produced games that are refreshing and innovative not to mention extremely addictive and fun to play
first there was the original super mario brothers and super matio brothers  for the nes to super mario world for the snes and now super mario  for the n
the game is  years old now but its still just as fun to play as ever
the graphics and sound make excellent use of the ns capabilities to create a d world that was just jawdropping in  and is still pretty awesome todayas others have said the basic story of the game is classic mario  bowser has kidnapped the princess and mario must rescue her
to do this he must collect a minimum of  stars from the  worlds in the game
these worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the mushroom castle plus there are  stars contained within the castle itself
although you only need  stars to finish the game there are a total of  stars available for collection and you wont be satisfied until you have collected each one
the  worlds have varying levels of difficulty but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult
it took me about  hours total to collect all  stars and rescue the princess the first time
each level has a different theme
some are on mountains some are in waterfilled caves and there is one set inside a giant clock
my personal favorite is the haunted house levelthe gameplay in mario  is exceptional
mario has many different types of moves ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies to a great long jump to a very difficulttomaster wall jump
you must master all the moves if you expect to get all  stars
also there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow mario to fly walk underwater and become invisible
again all are vital for  starsafter you finally win you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again
but such is not the case
even though you have all  stars you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over as much as you want
youll be tempted to do just that
the experience of playing through the incredible world of the mushroom castle is such that you will be coming back for many repeat visitsthis is easily the best game ive ever played
i played it back when it was first released for the n and at the time there was nothing else like it on any of the other platforms
it led the way for d gaming which is of course the norm now
to this day i still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in on occasion just to run around in the various worlds
the graphics still look pretty good and the game play is still fun
a simply incredible gameright off the bat before it came out youd probably wonder how would you ever imagine mario in d
well heres your answer mario theres  huge courses with  missions in each counting  coin stars with stars for rewards
those stars help you unlock more levelsat the time no one ever saw anything like this before
although the graphics look fairly primitive now they were still eye candy for most mario fans especially back thensuper mario  plays how a d game should be played like with a free camera flawless control and extremely playable environmentsgetting all  stars is the real challenge
spoiler alert if you do manage to get them all you get to visit yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you  lives along with an improved triple jump moveoverall you know what i want you to do so do it
buy the gameid like to say this game is surprisingly easythats a good thing if you play all the cards righti got in july of this year and beat it todaythe game has great visuals and music and i cant be the only one who feels a tinge of sadness when the screen says the endi get the feeling not because its a disappointmentit isnt at all but because it was a real great game with a real great storythats also why i like playing it again and againnintendo  isnt the best nintendo system of all time that title belongs to game cube but mario  is one of the greatest games ever madei feel anxious to put more n games into my collectionones like ocarina of timebanjo kazooie and majoras mask
the n was slightly disappointing because there just arent enough quality games for it but id be lying if i said it doesnt have at least  classicsstill the time has come for you to get a game cubenamcos museum is out for it so is super mario sunshinemetroid primesonic mega collectionstar fox adventuressuper smash bros meleeresident evilsuper monkey ball  and  and upcoming attractionsdont be afraid to buy a new nintendo system but remember to keep the n  alwaysa fun game all the way
you just cant get enough of this fantastic wonderful gamelove it the kids love it and its not xbox  lol moms and dads and some grand parents would love it toothis is it
the ground breaking game that shot the nintendo  sells thorough the roof and off to space
super mario  is a game that cant be found anywhere else
it is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay
i just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old
yes it is old now
this game was so dang much fun that they even made it for nintendo ds
if you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever madenintendo not xbox playstsion  or xbox  then look for super mario  you will not be dissapointed
guaranteedwe had this game before and as the years went by it became defective
after searching and searching it finally became available and we had to get itmy six year old grandson has had many hours of enjoyment especiall after receiving this cartridge and his console which shipped in another order
everything was smooth and merchandise arrived in excellent condition and in time prescribedstupid sony they forced d games out before anybody was ready
nintendo was forced to cancel many super nintendo games doom fx star fox  mario fx and release the nintendo  many popular d games failed in full d
castlevania mega man they failed and have not been revived
did mario succeed
yes
this game is a legend
i heard about it in  not  in a nintendo power magazine simply titled mario
i did not own a nintendo  this was 
the only system i had was an original wii that we used for mario kart
i was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a wii point card with  points on it enough for mario  and super mario bros 
i downloaded it and was greeted with a happy mario face that said hello
soon i was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears
then i started the game and got a message from peach
in her girly princess voice she read the letter which told mario she had baked a cake for him
the plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds
i had never played a d mario game
i stuck to animal crossing mario kart my sims and wii sports i was  years old
after a little bit of exploring i entered the castle
instead of a cake mario got a scary message from bowser who ate cake i guess
soon i was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown
he told me using fancy king words that in order to get the bomb i had to defeat him
i defeated him and moved on to the next level a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces
then i started level  a snow level
what a level that was
finding baby penguins building snowmen sliding down a slide
then my parents walked in
my mom said yuck
what are those dots supposed to be
those dots were snow flakes
my dad said are those graphics  bit
i had not even realized the graphics were bad because i was lost in the creative levels
each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star
each boss was different and interesting
the graphics are outdate so what
this along with mario  really changed my view of video games
now in  i have almost no respect for highpowered consoles like the xbox  kids should play these old games
how hard is it to get kids a  card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this
the challenge is not too much
if you get stuck on one level you can try another
this is a beautiful game that put the nintendo  to its limitswhen this game came out it was like a historic event
it felt like there was no longer a limit to what video games could do
every toy store had a booth set up where you could give this game a try
it was amazing to play and amazing to seethis game is still amazing
the play control is amazingly smooth and you can make mario do some unbelievable things
the worlds are amazing
you can go wherever you want to go do whatever you want to dojust look at the difference between this game and the original super mario bros for nes
my gosh the difference is astounding
its amazing how nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades
sometimes i love progresswhen super mario  was released ten years ago it was instantly the best video game ever created
simply put playing this game was a magical imaginationmindopening experience almost a mystical one in fact
this euphoric feeling and sense of awe that we felt the first time we played this game would never again be matched at least up until this stage in the video game realm
what made it so amazing was the fact that mario who had only existed in d in our minds as kids had now become like the cartoon character we watched on the super mario brothers cartoon
the days of nintendos rule were the great ones in video games and its a shame that kids nowadays wont get to grow up with mario like us generation xers
every mario game for me was truly magical but super mario  was truly revelatory
i spent years of my life playing this game literally and still play it more today than another other game available for any other system
unfortunately this was one of the few true masterpieces for the nintendo  and sony took over with the playstation
for me however nintendo and mario are what video games are all about and super mario  was the pinnacle of the entire industryone of the best games of its time and is still considered by many to be one of the best games ever made
i highly recommed this gamei remember the first time i laid eyes on this game
i had been hearing about how awesome the nintendo  was going to be from schoolmates as we eagerly anticipated the usa release of this system
i remember hearing how in demand it was and the ensuing shortage for the upcoming christmas before i even saw it
then one day i was christmas shopping with my dad and happened to come across a demo setup in the mall and i finally got to see what the massive hype was aboutthe game was bright and colorful and mario was fully d
a large crowd had gathered around to catch a glimpse of the latest in video game technology and i only lingered for a moment yet my first impression is still fresh in my memory
mario  looked like nothing i had ever seen before and also looked leaps and bounds better than anything i had ever seen on playstation sega saturn or any other system
i was very impressedseveral months later i finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with mario  i loved the game dearly back then and to this day i still love this game
it still looks feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era
while zelda ocarina of time is similar graphicswise that game is so great in its own right that both games deserve to be recognized separatelymario  is a perfect launch game for the nintendo  home console system
looking at the controller for the n one might have been understandably skeptical due to the layout
however mario  is actually very easy to control and is a good introduction to getting gamers accustomed to the new feel of the controller and its new button layoutwhen i say the controls for this game are very simple i must also mention that mario is capable of many actions
mario can walk run crawl jump triple jump backflip side somersault wall kick swim climb punch kick slide fly shoot from a cannon buttsplash hang handoverhand crouch surf on koopa shells and even look around
while this scope of actions seems like a lot and likely difficult to master the reality is that yes it is alot but is not difficult at all to master
a few of the skills such as wall kicking or flying take some practice to master but the majority of marios actions are very easy to master which results in very fluid gameplay and the sensation of actually being mariothe camera angles are manageable considering you have control over them
you might find yourself slightly frustrated with it in certain enclosed areas such as boos haunted house but for the most part the camera angles are very functional
the gameplay is extremely fun with a very gradual learning curve
while you only need  stars to complete the game players looking to oneup the challenge can elect to try and collect all  stars which requires true mastery of the gamethe music is outstanding
koji kondo also famous for the ocarina of time music did all the music for mario  and succeeded in composing very memorable and enjoyable tunes
my personal favorite is and will always be the jolly rodger bay  dire dire docks musicthe level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration
mario will find himself in sunken ships caves with toxic gas inside a volcano a pyramid in a desert a fortress in the sky sliding down slippery snowy slopes and even inside a giant strange clock
this game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay
i dont believe ive ever met anyone that didnt find this game fun to playno luigi is not in the game
there was a major hoax citing ridiculous methods that would unlock luigi but all proved untrue
kind of strange luigi wasnt in the game but not that big of a dealmario  is well loved and remembered but it is kind of strange that the nintendo s launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed
super mario world on super nintendo was a gem but there were other great games in the snes library
however with the nintendo  super mario  along with zelda ocarina of time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the nintendo  library which is disappointing considering that we see the nintendo  was capable of supporting topnotch games
the nintendo  library just didnt manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch gamein the end mario  will always be remembered as the revolutionary classic that literally defined the nintendo bit era years later still a great gamethis is a classic in every sense of the wordit not only redefined the mario franchise
it redefined d gamingit is a must have it you still own a nregister nowusernameby now many mario fans have taken a look at either the japanese or us version of super mario  so well spare you most of the hype and rhetoric
having said that it must be stated that sm is the greatest videogame to date and one which all games regardless of genre will be judged henceforth
nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with sm
look closely marios lineage is d  not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized d videogame ever
but videogames are in the end meant to entertain
and entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic titlelike many previous mario games experimentation is integral to the experience of playing
you must explore everything leave no rock unturned no mushroom mute no door unopened
mario himself has so many possible movements and the environment is so intensely interactive that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular
the game is initially less accessible than previous mario titles although the threepronged analog controller isnt really where the difficulty lies  the joypad itself performs excellently
overall the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint
the camera which moves on its own unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons tries to find the optimal angle to view the action though occasionally youre simply not able to see where youre going
additionally frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tiptoeing across a tiny ledge
but getting the hang of sm is all a matter of practice  and as soon you catch on you will execute these skills unconsciously
the variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking
the game consists of  massive courses in which mario can attain seven stars per course with numerous secret areas and bonuses including  extra stars for a total or  stars
itll surely take the average gamer  hours to reach the third and final bowser and free the princess not to mention find yoshi so the games replay value is bountiful
and despite all of their saccharinsweet cuteness the graphics are magnificent
shigeru miyamotos dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized  the animation is lavish the textures rich and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed
sm is not perfect however
despite the efficiency of the hardwares load management drawin is noticeable and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects
still this is as close to perfection a game has ever been bit no less
super mario  also puts nintendos preference of quotsilicon over cdsquot to the test with pleasingly familiar results
most owners of either a saturn or a playstation or both have by now acclimated to long load times though grumblingly
super mario  will remind them of how gaming used to be load time is nil and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds
from the time you switch on the unit until youre done the flow is seamless and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous
nintendos musical prodigy koji kondo turns in an inspired performance somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world
even though some tracks are cheesy others like the sitarladen score of the first fire level are more than effective in setting the mood for the level and are as atmospheric as any redbook audio
also impressive are the sound effects marios onscreen antics are matched by grunts whoops and hollers fleshing out his spunky personality
as a whole the flagship n game more than makes up for any painful delay or delays imposed upon the units release
sm is complete in every way and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the games minimal flaws
nintendos craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in super mario  nintendo s early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of miyamoto and team
not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous d incarnations of the mario franchise
d worlds are huge and cleverly laidout so that theres never a dull moment
secrets play a huge part of the experience recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series
in fact this game is exactly as one might hope it would be mario in d
more freedom more space more options better graphics improved and elaborated control schemes  its all there
possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever
dont rent
buythis game is great
i played a friends and then they gave it to me ive beat it
i still have to try to get all the stars but i will
the game is real fun and interactive with many great lands and levels to get the stars and fun bosses
the game is just really great i really love it
it rockssuper mario  when i first got nintendo it came with super mario when the system was hooked upi put in the gameand was amazed on how the graphics wereit was excellentthe graphics were greatthe music was cooland mario never looked betterthis game is for everyonei thought banjokazooie was a great gamebut move over banjomario is backthe best game everfeatures new worldscharacterssettingand dont worry some of the old villians from the early mario games are hereand cant forget bowser and princess toadstoolpeachbetter than any  game ever madewhy is this on the list because for the time it was the cream of the crop
and its also one of the funnest mario games youll ever play

i have played this game over and over and built incredible cities like new san francisco
i know you will experience tons of fun when you buy this onewhen you first buy this game you will need to give it time
reading the  manual first just might be alot of help
the game starts out in pause mode
this gives you time to zone space for roads residental amp commercial or  indutry zones water pipes and electrical wires
it times take to know the  best way to zone rcis
its not easy and money can disappear fast so dont  go crazy zoning everything and destorying things it will cost you
it sum  this review in one sentence
it takes time to build a perfect city so try  different approaches and eventually your get it righti can play this game comfortably on my old xp machine without a special video card
thats worth a lot in my book
not to mention the joy of spending most of my gaming time building rather than destroying
however if you want you can sick all kinds of crises and destroy the city if you want sometimes thats fun
this is a great strategy gamesim city  is really cool
you start off by making a power planti prefer fusion or microvavelaying power lineszoning residentailcommercailand industrial areasdisposing of garbagemaking roads andor a mass transit systemmake water structures and pipelinesand take care of civic needs
later in the game you might want to enact some ordinancesruleslawsmake business deals with neighbors and organizationsset a budgetearlier on the computer does it for youbuild rewards which most of them can only be optained thru business deals ones optained without dealcounty courthousemayoral mansion also know as youre housecity hallperforming of arts centerand monumentstatue
ones optained thru dealgigamallamusement parkspace portdefense contractorcountry golf clubetc
plus you can add landmarks to youre city
this is a great gamebut for sim city  fans that want a totaly different game get the unlimited versionalso known as sim city  unlimitedi didnt know that star soldiers is a remake from the early nintendo game you can check it out on youtube first if you like its a vertical d shooter
great gameive had a great time with this one you can pick from  alternative but well balanced ships play with a comfortable control scheme rake high scores and combos use powerful special weapons collect and preserve powerups by staying alive deflect shots by doing rolls and are complimented with a remarkable engaging soundtrack
the powerups are what make this game stand out because the ships seem to upgrade almost endlessly until youre firing more powerful and voluminous attacksi mentioned the controls before between the dpad rolling with the rightshoulder button firing special attacks with the leftshoulder and b buttons and keeping hold on the a button and firing strategically to maintain a shot combo its fun and easy to use
that being said the missions in vanishing earth arent easy by any means because you need to avoid hitting ships as well as being fired on and the bosses are particularly adept at relentlessly firing at youhowever players are offered consolation in that they can continue from the beginning of the mission after losing and can store a password if theyd like personally i enjoy staring over from the beginning so i can keep all the powerups i earn
and even if you dont want to play the whole game theres a fast  or  minute arcadestyle mode where you earn as high a score as you can destroying enemy vessels with maximum power upgrade from the starti had a lot of fun switching off with a friend but its good for single player as well
not as flawless as super star soldier and i mean that particularly with regard to the visuals of the area you fly over not being as outstanding but overall it still looks good enough not to harm the fun vanishing earth is also much easier to collect for than its turbografx counterpart
if you can get the cartridge around    dollars i say go for it because theres hours of enjoyable content that will leave you coming back for morethis game is amazing
the music makes you look forward to every fight and the pace doesnt let you blink
and yet you feel the artwork and the location youre at
youve got three highly distinct ships to use
list of them in order of difficultyeasy red ship
spreadshot gatling gun that gets more shots in per level but power never truly upgradesmedium blue ship
powerful pulse laser punches straight through enemies and it gains spread upon the final leveluphard green ship
spread shot eventually reaches a strategic halfmoon shape that makes every shot countits a shame that no other arcade shooters exist on the n it couldve had other great games like raystorm and gdarius in a heartbeati did not play this on n but i did play it in the arcade
it is such a wonderful and awesome game it is not even the least bit funny
the graphics rock the arenas are both cool looking and interesting there are many cool moves each of the fighters have and the endings are movies
i have won this game four times all four as none other than scorpion my favorite mk fighter times i won mk
perfect fit
i love this game it is cooler than nearly any game i know there are some of the coolest fighters ever along with scorpion in it and i plan to get it for my computer
perioddespite mixed emotions from reviewers all over mortal kombat  is an awesome fighting game
taking the once d game into d now adds alot of depth
the game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so those who still have the twitch when it comes to fighting games will feel right at home
i remember when i played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out
i went up against a  year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but i was tickled to just get to play it
im tickled its out for the systems
definitely worth checking out
collect it if you canthis was my all time favorite both on the arcade and at home
great classic as far as fighting games went back in its time
works wonderfully
thanks so muchi like nintendo  also i really enjoy watching the mortal kombat movies and playing the mortal kombat games yeahnow ill be reviewing mortal kombat  which is hated by some some do like it they the mk team was trying to change it with the times  ill admit its not as good as mortal kombat ii  ultimate mortal kombat  or mortal kombat trilogy it has its problems but i like it
mk  came out in the summer of  it was the last mortal kombat game to be in arcades most of the principle characters return liu kang raiden johnny cage reptile sub zero  scorpion
goro returns which kind of pi s  s  es me off  hes harder than he was in mk  or mk trilogy  he wasnt even in mk  you fought quan chi as the sub boss
jax  sony are back
some of the newer characters i didnt care for like reiko he was a poor substitute for noob saibot but noob is a secret character he has no ending though
goro is another secret character  he has no ending so its pretty pointless
i hate kai
jarek is just another poor substitute for kano
ilike fujin quan chi tanya is alright
shinnok is cool to play as
story is shinnok escaped the neterreln thousands  thousands of years ago shinnok was an elder god he betrayed them he needs this powerful amulant
raiden  shinnok fought over it  ended with millions of people dying shinnok was banished to the neterreln
while the invasion of earthrelm was going on noob saibot helped quan ch get shinnok out of the neterreln
shinnok overtaken edina takes kitana hostage
kitana is liu kangs love of his life all around good time girl
so liu kang helps raiden
shinnok has killed most of the elder gods except for a wind god fujin
quan chi  scorpion have a history he tells scorpion yes that sub zero is lying about being a brother that he ready killed his clan  his family
also tanya a new fighter  reptile join to help shinnok
tanyas job is trap liu kang  have him killed  if youre seen her ending she does its not official liu kang lives on until mk v shinnok agrees to send him back in time to his original race if he helps him reptile is lied to again since shinnok is a fallen elder god the battle can be won by motals
jax  sonya are hunting down a black dragon guy named jarek  if you have beat this game as jax its a really bad a  s  s ending
the fmv endings look better on the ps
its not perfect the main boss shinnok i quan chi shouldve been the boss instead hes in most of the endings
nothing wrong with shinnok ill say this hes better than the dragon king or blaxe cause they were straight forward run of the mill monsters
but when you compare him to shang tsung or shao kahn he doesnt measure up
the game has a lot of in your face gore
this game got ported to the playstation  nintendo   an expanded version called motal kombat gold on the sega dreamcast
the  version has the advantage that its a cartridge no load time but the  controller isnt made for fighting games
the playstation version has better picture quality for the endings  you can get an arcade stick for it
ive never played or have dreamcast but ive heard mk gold is glitchy but kung lao baraka kitana are added i think it has millena  cyrax
i dont know if mame will run it
this woulalso be the last game of  the boon tobias era
next is going to be an all time gulity pleasure motal kombat anhillationthis game is a few years old of course but i was so pleased with it that i played it all last night after it was shipped to me
definitely the best fighting game for the fading n platform
it is somewhat easy on the easy settings almost too easy mind you and as you increase the challenge level the computer opponents increase in ability almost  foldthe only gripe that i have is that some moves are just not condusive to being made on the n controller
my hands also wanted to keep sliding over into the traditional n grip on the controller with the stick and not the pad but this game does not play well with the stick and thus you have to use the pad
that will feel weird at first
you can remap the buttons to better suite your needs but if you do other moves will be more difficult to pull off as well
for instance subzeros famous slide is almost impossible to do without taking your right hand off the controller and repositioning it on the correct buttons to make him do his slide
while youre doing this youre getting your butt kicked because how are you going to concentrate on where the buttons are during the fighti still give it  stars because those problems are not really that significant in the long run
the combo system is wonderful and anyone who is looking for a good fighting game on the n console should pick this one up
with the price that it is at now it is very affordable too
i highly recommend itmk is a superior fighting game
my mouth is watering for mortal kombat deadly alliance
in mk there are the classic fighters scorpion subzero reptile sonya liu kang  jax
plus some fighters that were introduced in the flawed subzero mytholiogies quan chi  shinnock plus new for mk tanya fugin kia recko  jarek theres a total of  fighters with  hidden fighters  all together
this game moves very fast if you know how to play it
but until then your fighter may look a little silly jumping around while your getting the hang of things
personally i like the mortal kombat kombo system and over all formula better than any other fighting game
favorite fighters r quan chi reptile subzero  liu kang
least favorites r oh i likem all
wanna cheat menu for easy fatalities
try this go to options highlight continues hold block  run at the same time for about  seconds you will hear outstanding continue to hold the buttons for  more seconds
a menu will appear
now when it says finish him you may perform a fatality by holding down  pressing the b buttonthe first time i played this game i was in the mall and it was cool
so i decided to get it when it came out
its a lot more different looking than mk trilogy
it looks more realistic also
the title says it allmortal kombat is a totally cool fighting game series
digitized and bloody fighting combined with neckbreaking spineripping fatality moves make the series seem like gold
but i personally find the transition from d to d for this series scary at first glance
i originally thought the fatalities would end up being like horror movie scenes
however i ended up sticking with itin arcade mode there were about  or  difficulty modes
in mortal kombat on the snes i played well on it
in mortal kombat  on game boy i was able to tackle hard mode
in mortal kombat  for game boy i can beat master mode but that version of this game was too easy
here i got my butt kicked even on normal mode
the game is pretty challenging but i think if a players good enough he can whop through easilythe gameplay is traditional mortal kombat fighting action
there are also some new moves such as twisting someones legthe graphics are also really great especially considering some of the nintendo s limits such as the d blood during the game over screenand of course the sound is topnotchthere are very few fighting games for the nintendo  and this is your saving grace for your virtual strengthsup dawg
lets be serious here
i am not in any way the god who made nintendo
i am however the god of battletanx
from exploding nukes to mini howitzers to the flash being incarnated into a tank
this game has it all
call of duty aint got a thing on this beauty
you can kidnap queens you can dominate the world map you can even stand around like a pacifist and let yourself die
this game has what you want
this game has what you need
you must obtain battletanxi used to play this game with my dad all the time when i was younger
i actually ordered it recently to play with him again when my nintendo  stopped working
hathe main game is ok but the multiplay game is hella fun
grab a friend or two and play all night
i never get tired of battletanxbuy it
play battlelord mode with four teams preferably on the las vegas map
thats about all youd do anyway
dont bother with the singleplayer its garbage
i didnt bother finishing it
i played the first five or six levels id guess and it was so easy and the story was so retarded that i just didnt care anymore
the multiplayer is where its at
totally intense
you play as different factions each one with a slightly different tank setthere are only three kinds of tankgoliath the generic kind and a super fast little one w only machine guns the tankset just determines how many of each youll getsome are only goliaths or the little ones and things like that
each faction also has a special starting weapon
guided missileswhich are very good against base defenses since you dont have to go in there and get pelted cloaking shields swarm missiles etcso yeah the multiplayer is simply amazing and the game is definitely cheap enough by now that if you see it you should buy it without question
dont worry about the graphics
you wont notice when youre dodging guided missiles goliath tanks and mines trying to get the queenlord back to your base so you can win the roundalso if you do get it you might consider setting the control setup to driver because the default control setup is kinda deplorablethis game is great
you can either duel it out with up to  of youre freindsplus you or do a single player campaign
let me explain single player campaign first
a deadly virus kills  of women in the game and so the national guard takes the reamaining women to a quarantine zone
in the gameyou are griffin spade and you must rescue madison from the federal relocation forcesearlier reffered to as the national guard
to progress in the gameyou must destroy enemy tanks and bunkersdestroy enemy bases prior to rescueing the queenlords inside themthe last base is the quarantine zone in snfrinsiscotake the queenlords to youre base via youre tankearn new types of tanks as you progressgoliathmaand a minature onegain ally tanks by earning pointsnoteyou cant get ally tanks until after rescueing the first qeenlordand gain power ups which provide youre tank with sheildsreplacement armorif youre tank gets damagedweaponsand ammo
the capaign mode is really fun and has good replay valueconsidering you can get more tanks if you get more points than you did lst timebut its still good to do multiplayer modes with freinds for both practiceto prepair for campaign mode and fresh challengesif youve beat campaign mode more than once
plus campaign mode includes bonus rounds where you can earn extra points
okay heres a list of all the multiplayer modesdeathmatchyou must be on youre own against other players for this onebut you can get automatick gun terrets to assist youannilationdepending on the gang you chooseyou get a certain number of goliathsminature tankssimilar in size to gun terretsand of coursemas
battlordsimply steal enemy queenlords
strategy is greatly involved as theyre are  ways to get past a enemy goliath tankfire guided missiles from your own basemove in and out fast with a moto tankhead on attacklay mines on its trackor place a neough gun buddies to take it down
defense measures include protecting your goliath tanklaying mine around your baseswitching to goliath tankor placing gun buddiesim not a fan of fpss by far
theyre one of my least favorite genres
but this game is just excellent one of the best licensed games ive had the joy of seeingunless you own a controller pak you cant save the game and the controls can be hard to understand at first but its an excellent gameomg
seen it wiped my eyes to see if it was real then of course bought and i have no regrets
highly love south park and this game is amazing and it came to me mint condition and i was happythis game if so funny
pee snowballs annoying turkeys and it is in south park colorado what more could you ask for
the controls are hard at first but in  minutes it becomes easy
the game is really fun and looks great on the super funny game
a little raunchy but hilarious all the while
may not be appropriate for younger kids
the story is fun to play yet predictablei love south park
i remember walking around in middle school back in the s with the south park shirts on and everyone talking about the new episode
times have changed but i still love south parknow if you are a fan or those d games and stuff like that you probably will think this is a disgrace for the n
i thought this game was awesome
especially the beginning forest of silence
the music and sound effects are great and the game story is good
the controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge get this
i think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but i think when you get to higher levels im not sure of this there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure
i thought the game could have been a little morewelldiverse and detailed but where i am now is awesome
i have to say i bought this at fucoland and i had no idea i would like it this much
i rented it once before and i hated it because it was so hard
really i just didnt put my mind to it and look where i am now
im in the st castle
this is a great actionrpg game that will keep you hooked for hours
i would recommend that  and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes
there isnt much of a story to this game but for me thats okay
but for serious gamers i think i am but this game is so good that i dont really care about the story you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story
there many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time
the forest of silence took me about  hours to figure everything out no cheats no guide no nothing
there are two charaters to chose from
reinhart and a girl i forgot her name
now reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things
i think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon
the girl has a energy ball that takes  seconds to charge up
i dont like that because if an enemy is comming towards you you have to charge
she also has these tworings they look like
she uses that to slice things just like reinharts sword
there are two modes you can go through
easy and normal
normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy
there are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff
as i mentioned before their isnt much of a storyline but when you start the game there is some
so that makes the game better
be prepared to do a lot of jumpingoverall this game has great sound effects music weapons items charaters abilities an okay storyline excellent graphics and just a really good playi was really eager to see this installment in the castlevania series
mainly because of its venture into d well i can honestly say i was pleasantly surprised
they were able to pull off a pretty decent game and that in itself makes it another great effort from konami
it really reminded me alot of the older castlevania games yet in d despite others mixed feelings on the game i really enjoyed it
my only gripe however is that it was hard and frustrating at times with its platform areas in levels
once i made it pass those parts it was great
one in my opinion that was worthy of my hard earned dollar
although i love the d castlevania games a great deal i do hope they make another game like this one in the futurethis game still creeps me out
its really fun to have those memories come flooding back as i whip my way through skeletonsthis game in my opinion is the best of all the castlevania series so far except maybe legacy of darkness
the soundtrack is awesome
the graphics are very well done and it gives you a sense of being there and actually relaying the fear instead of being dull and boring
also you have to at least rent this game the cinema scenes are awesomecastlevania  is one of the greatest games in the world a true classic the best of the best buy this game if your a castlevania fan you wont be sorryevil has once again awakened in the dark princes palacewith alot of bad guys and  hard to beat levelsand dont forget our stars of the gamea bravekicking butt little girlcarrieand a brave young whipping manreinhardtthis game will keep you on your tippy toesyou explore an old huge housedraculas castlethe forestand even places you would only see in your nightmaresthis game is for  and up due to strong bloody violencegreat music and settingthis is a game you can sink your teeth intoclassic game for the ps
i love it and it still makes me smile like it did when i was a kid
the new verisions cant compare to the original
whether you are a s child trying to relive your childhood or want to share it with the new generation you will have hours of fun with everyones favorite purple dragoni was feeling nostalgic so i bought this game along with a few others to relive my childhood
its as much fun as i remember
theres always plenty to do from finishing levels to completing timed flight races
even if you beat the final boss in the game you can keep playing to collect all the gems and find all the dragons
once you do that you get to open up new content
even at  complete theres still more to do not to mention the replayability of the game is superb
definitely worth the buya wonderful game and i believe that it is a lot better than the second
in the second the graphics are solid but the bad guys arent the greatest bad guys and plus the levels look alike
anyways in this game youll jump off prehistoric glaciers face giant enemies glide across cliffs and free enslaved dragons and collect gems and treasure
sure some parts of this game is a little frustrating and sure the camera angles are a bit awkward but you get used to it and get the hang of it
its a lot like rp games where the first time you play it it is incredibly hard but once you beat it youll play it hundreds of times
i must have beat this game atleast thirty times
probably forty
anyways buy it
its worth your money
the graphics are fluid and spectacular and at times this game can have some humor in it
its worth the money believe megreat fun game i still enjoyed playing  years later
i got it at a great price too
definitely buy thisfor those who dont know this is the very first spyro game
this is such an awesome gamepros
the graphicsgiven it is for the ps they are a little outdated but looking back they are comical
the storythe game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time
the dialogueabsolutely funny and genius since spoiler alert
the reason gnasty gnorc the main villain freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly
there are minigames you can go back to after beating the gamecons
i cant think of anyah spyro
released in  for the ps spyro is the first entry of many
although only the first three were any good because the newer ones were owned by an poor company
graphics  horrible by todays standards but very good by  standards
colorful and clear oldschool d graphicsmusic pretty catchy nothing really grinds on your earssound  pretty goodgameplay you control spyro the pod dragon through many worlds
there he must collect gems rescue dragons fight enimies bosses and other dangers and also use his trademark flame and charge moves
this game is a bit easy but its very entartainingthe game costs about  about now so buy iti have recently come across this wonderful little game that is just absolutely perfect for darklings seemingly tailormadefirst of all the flow of the d graphics are quite realistic
the character is an adorable baby dragon with all the mannerisms of what a baby dragon might be as if the creators modeled him from puppies  kittens which is probably what they didso little spyro is set to explore in his homeland where he derives sustainance from sheep  questing for gems  treasures perusing into archways  temples  fending off sheepherders armed with staves
the satanic implications are obvious
a dragon insinerating sheep for food
sheepherders protecting their sheep
predator vs preyin certain situations such as when killing a charging ram smashing into walls giants attacking you will note the joystick vibrate thereby making the gaming experience a bit more tactileso the player is spyro the dragon helped along with the advice of ancestors
it is remarkable how noble these mentors are their voices echoing their arcane wisdom unto their youngin travelling we also embark into stone creek  the more aestheticallypleasing dark hollow where new creatures wander to be defeated  more treasures to be plundered
bit by bit little spyro learns to glide then eventually flygaming tip avoid waterive been addicted to spyro since i was a little kid and this is the original game that got me hooked
im terrible at video games but i love to play this im sure experienced gamers could beat this kind of game with their eyes closed but for me its quite the challenge and i enjoy itokay i first played this back when it first came out and back when the graphics were good
now it is almost  years later and i still absolutely love this game although its graphics are oldschool compared to say the wiis graphics or pss
but this game was good
it was not easy for me but with a little practice i got better
there is only one egg that still is a challenge for me to get and i dont remember the name of the subworld it is in but its the one with a whole bunch of trees
i always forget where to turnjump to get the height and speed i need to reach the egg
but big deal this game is how i remember spyro and brings back fond memoriesone reviewer had a good point when he said the dragons you release from the stone do give you some pretty redundant advice such as telling you how to glide after you just finished gliding to reach the little booger
but you can interrupt them which i always do so no biggie
the minigames are fun and even though you dont have to complete them to finish the game there is a part of me that always has to complete the game 
i will hunt down every gem every egg and every pink egg from those annoying blue things you chasethis isnt the best spyro game but it is among the top three
the other two are the two that followed this one
insomniac knew how to make these games and i wish theyd make any others that come out because frankly universal vivendi etc
ruined this series for megraphics   all the spyro games have amazing graphics and this one is no exception
fabulous beautiful eyecatching
check em outsound   spyros usual flapping wings splashing water swishing buck sound and great editing satisfy even if the overall sound couldve improvedvalue   fun to play at the time but you wont go back to spyro to go and play it again and again too many times
but it looks great and is still entertaining so its worth the moneyoverall   this blew me away with its creativity and amazing graphics
the ultimate original d platform game
if you liked this i recommend the crash bandicoot games and the sequels to spyro the dragon which are even better than this tasty candythe original playstation spyro the dragon trilogy is the best game series out there especially for younger gamers and people that just like to play easy games to pass time like me
this game started it all with spyro and its still one of the best video games ever made in my opinion
if you have never played a video game or just want a little something different to play this is a nice and easy one for youthe game for its time was good both for its gameplay and its graphics
the game was one of the first demo games i played and it was tough but later on i got the hang of it and passed it
it took me some time but in the end it was well worth itone of the first games i ever played on the ps
spyro is a classic and still fun to play today on my ps slim
great for all ages to play a fun easying going relaxing game
you play as spyro a young dragon that has to rescue all the other dragons from nasty nork to defeat him but along the way spyro is traveling through different worlds collecting items and treasures
make sure you have a ps memory card to save your progress if your using a ps systemhad to get this game beings my mamas sister bought me one but the disc was messed up in certain parts of the game
i enjoyed it very much and the challenge behind it was unlike any other game i played
thanksthe original spyro is an incredibly fun game
although not nearly as refined as year of the dragon or riptos rage the classic spyro is still hours of fantastic entertainmentfun game
never played a dragon with an attitude of kick butt until i found spyroi used to play this game as a kid but my copy got ruined and ive wanted a new one ever since
i bought this one and could not be more pleased with it
works great and a nice reminder of some of the fun i had when i was youngername me one child of the nineties who didnt grow up playing this game and i will show you an unhappy adult
spyro was a very important part of my childhood happiness and remains a part of my life to this day
in a time where all the other young girls around me were playing with kitchen sets and drawing on the sidewalk with chalk i was kicking gnorc buttas im sure there are some people out there who are still unfamiliar with everyones favorite purple dragon how about a quick rundownthe dragon realms are a peaceful place full of artists and dreamers and crafters and they pride themselves on their beautiful gems
while some dragons are being interviewed about their world the long banished gnasty gnorc overhears some less than positive comments about himself
in retaliation he turns all of the dragons beautiful gems which reflect his face back at him into gnorc minions and freezes the dragons in crystal prisons
all that is except one short little purple firebreather who becomes the hero by taking it upon himself to defeat the gnorcs and free all the dragonsyou utilize two attacks your flame breath and your horn charge
throughout the levels you encounter several types of enemies but especially gnorcs
your goal throughout the game is to unfreeze all the dragons and collect stolen dragon eggs from the taunting blue thieves
each of the six homeworlds contains a nonmandatory boss battle aside from the gnorc gnexus and a balloonist who will transport you to the next homeworld
your health meter is represented by a little dragonfly by the name of sparx that follows you around
sparx starts out bright yellow dulls to blue then to green and once he is gone youre toast
lives are gained with small dragon statues or collecting so many of a small silver orb dropped by previously defeated enemiesspyro is a classic that will never die and your life will only be made better by playing itspyro is a cute little dragon with a huge boost of cool powers
it is an incredibly fun game action game that is great for kids or adultsi played the original spyro trilogy extensively multiple times in my childhood having attained a  completion status on the first  spyro games released
i am no stranger to the series or this game in particular obviously
i bought this game almost only because of the nostalgic value it has to me
as well as the fact that im attempting to amass a collection of all game console systems and the best of their games according to my own opinionsbut on to the game itself
as the subject title implies for me it is and always will be a timeless classic in the history of videogames as it is almost the first real game i ever played and actually tried and succeeded in completing
for the time its graphics were close to cutting edge and the story is simple yet actually completing everything  is quite a difficult task depending on what part youre trying to do so on
the gameplay mechanics are a little stiff but no more than expected from a game released in  on a system that has been rebooted  times since the one this game was developed for
if you care at all about great games or if you played this in your childhood youre going to want this for your collectioni have all the ps spyro games and i love them the newer games not so much
this is one of my favorite ps series of games and id recommend all of these games to anyone in a heartbeat
this is a family friendly title and a good game to own
some of the game was a little challenging for me at first
i remember the ads and wanting to have this game and the unwasted excitement when i finally held the case in my handsspyro is the main characterobviously a little purple dragon with sparxa dragonfly and his best friend following him around sparx represents spyros health and proctects spyro
he can only take so many hits or damage spyro should of recieved before spyro is on his own and can only get hit once to avoid this however you can ram or flame the sheepcalled fodder and they will turn into butterflies which sparx eats in one bite for a life
the mission of the game is to free your fellow dragons who were all turned to crystal statuesspyro wasnt tall enough to get hit by the spell get the eggs and dragon treasure back and beat gnasty gnorc who hates dragons and besides turning them into statues stole all the dragon treasure and the dragon eggsthis game is sososo good
you can play it for hours and not get bored
if you are lonely or boredget spyro nownow now
it is so greatyoull adore itdo not be fooled by the fact that dragons are more suited to little kids and that the game appears like a cartoon
this is a very fun game in which an evil creature called gnasty gnorc scatters gems all over the dragon world turns some into his minions lets blue thieves into the dragon world to steal their precious dragon eggs and encases all the dragons in crystal
he missed spyro so its his job to turn the dragon world the way it was
the graphics are colorful and the sound and music are also nice and as for replay value it has a fairly good amount
if there is one thing to complain about it is the difficulty level
the enemies dont put up too much of a threat and finding gems and dragons is usually fairly easy and even the bosses are pretty easy to toast
but it can prove quite a challenge to some people and may include some testing with some things
but besides these two facts spyro the dragon is a nice colorful game that is well worth the moneythis game is a very fun game
very well made
you play spyroduh a young dragon
all the other dragonsi think there are  or so of them  have been captured and turned to stone  and are scattered about in the different worlds
the dragon eggs have been stolen by theives who are running around and hiding in different worlds
the dragons treasure is lying around everywherenot to mention alot of it has been turned into enemies
and who is the cause of this
gnasty gnorc
and now as spyro you must save the dragons  find the eggs collect the treasure and defeat gnasty gnorc
ok  thats the plot basicall now here is what the game is like  as spyro your mission is toas i said before save the dragons find the tresure and rescue the eggs
being a young dragon  your wings are not fully grown  so you can not fly
you can however glide over short distances
you also have the ability toof coursebreathe fire and charge with your horns
there are several worlds throughout the game
each of these worlds has one home level and in each of the home levels there are doorwayportholes through which lie other levels for the worlds
in each of the worlds there will be dragons treasure and eggsdragons  these have been turned to stone by gnasty gnorc
to save them you simply find them then walk up to them or charge at them or flame them
they will then come back to life and talk to you before flying away
some will give you advice  others will thank you and some will just talk sometimes insulting youtreasure  treusure is just lying around in different places
most of the enemies turn into treasurewhich looks like gem stones
some treasure are in chests
most chests can be rammed or flamed to open them but some requre dynamite or fire works or other ways to open themeggs these are held by theives
to get them  you must chase after the theif and ram or flame himenemies there is a large variety of enemies most enemies are really treasure that have been turned into minions for gnasty gnorc
most can be killed by ramming or flaming  though some are armored and can only be hurt by flaming and not by ramming or visa versa
some boss enemies however require special battle tacticsthere are also fairies who will help you in some way
some will catch you if your falling and will move you to safety  while others will give you a super strong fire breathwhich will allow you to flame armored enemies
hovering above spyro is a dragonfly
the color of the dragon fly shows you your current health
green if your have full health and red if you are very hurt
he will disappear if you get hurt when he is red
in each home world there are guys with hot air ballons
these ballooners tell you what you must do in that world for them to take you to the next world you can always return to past worlds later to pck up anything you might have missed
in most worlds you usually have to find a certain number of dragons treasure or eggs
finally you will get to gnastys world where you will have to fight gnasty gnorcwell thats quotspyro the dragonquot
i recommend this game to anyone who has playstation
its not a waste of money  i assure youi know this is an old game but this is definitely a classic to have
when eventually i have have kids or when my nieces and nephews grow a little older ill introduce them to these classic games
this is one of the best ps games out thereawww good times
i first bought this game when it first came out when i was around eightyearsold
i played it nonstop battleing against the gnorcs aquiring treaure ramming through thouse nasty blue thieves for the pinkspotted eggs getting more life for poor spyro and resqueing the dragons locked in stone of coursenow im playing more mature games
resident evil  is one of my favorite games for the gamecube counsel
along with the legend of zelda ocarine of timetwilight princess and hitman  but after playing thouse games on the sparkling gamecube counsel i turned my gaze to the dusty gray playstation and out popped spyro againim actually replaying the game i already beaten both of the two first worlds in under an hour
but it is a really good experience to play this old jewel again
i also own four other spyro games spyro riptos rage the year of the dragon both of thouse for my old playstation and are very fun
along with the alright but not the same heros tale and the crappy game some idiot thought up the legend of spyro a new beggining
i despised thouse two games for what they had done to that cool little dragon we use to knowbut alas
at least i saved my original game for times like these
please if you still have your old gray playstation or a playstation  than fish out spyro from the attic or the closet and replay it
or if you are new to the first original spyro games go out and buy them
that is if you dont mind an extreamly easy game the game is fun nevetheless it being easy it holds that sparkling air that ocarina of time and super mario  holds
sparks the dragonflygold  full healthblue  medium healthgreen  low healthno sparks  one more hit leftto correct anyone that got sparks color coded health wrong
spyro the dragonable to glide shortdistancescan runram with his hornscan jumpcan buckand can do the roll to avoid enemy attack why didnt they remake that move for all the other games i ask
and of course flame enemieswell with a million reviews already this makes it even easier for me
one of the original and best actionadventure games for the ps you cant go wrong with spyro and the proceeding sequels
owned the game a while back but my nephew somehow lost it
i completed it fully an im about to play through it again even though its been like  years
never got the sequels but im getting them from here now
got  more playstation classics to go including spyro  and game most played by my granddaughter
she loves the game
it is fun to watch as well
good game for kidslike everyone says the first three spyro games on the ps were great classics and all the others suck
yes ps gamecube xbox xbox  wii ps and wii u all have bad spyro games
the only good spyro games are on ps and maybe gba
and im not just making this up i actually bought a used ps to play the original spyro and ive played legend of spyro on my gamecube
and even though i really like the gamecube i hated legend of spyro
on top of that the most modern systems have even worse spyro gamesi am a latecomer to tenchu
since it is a ps game its graphics really show the pss age against the ps
however if you are willing to acceptignore that difference you will find tenchu a very satisfying and deeply fun game
this is most definitely one of pss best gamesthe game becomes more enjoyable the better you are able to master your ninjitsu skills
the controls are difficult to master at first but stick with it and you will eventually be rewarded
i used to just jump off a roof and try and hack at my enemy
now i can do a reverse back flip off a roof behind an enemy and exact a perfect kill
far too coolpros many many ways to finish a level stealth is heart throbbingly fun plentiful cheats for amateurs wonderful soundtrack
i ended up buying a copy of the soundtrack too variety of ninjitsu moves makes killing stylishly funcons since it is a stealth game you have to be very patient to make sure no one can see you before you go for the kill
this can take a long time each level is long and the boss is at the end of the level
dying in the boss hands means you have to start the whole level from the beginning no saves during a level joypad controls are difficult to master but are necessary to support all the ninjitsu movesthis game offers unique play
it has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper
unlike metal gear you actually loose points by being spotted even if you make it through the mission successfully
you can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score or you can go on to the next mission
i liked that aspect the most because the second time around knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you you get to get the drop on them
cool beansi have been searching for this game far and wide and now i have finally acquired it
its a pretty awesome game with a lot of action and you must use a lot of stealthi actually did purchase this game two times
i lent it out some years ago and never got it back
i recently noticed that the price is very modest so i picked it up again
why
this game is an older generation game ps but it is better than some ps games i have played that only advertise graphics but have poor gameplay or short game time
tenchu is a satisfying game that lets you creep around slice necks from behind and hide out on rooftops
you will avenge the death of a crooked merchant rescue a captive nijna save a princess destroy a fiendish cult stop the spanish pirates and fight a big boss with a bigger sword
of course there are those who opppose this type of activity and thus will try to stop you
its lots of fun running around hiding killing from the unseen
its better while doing it while the great game soundtrack is playing
this game has very catchy music that brings you you right in
the graphics like i said are mediocre but that wont make or break a game anyway
gameplay makes the game and this game has plently
plenty of enemies to defeat two selectable characters a bunch of ninja items to utilize and the percect amount of levelswhat isnt so good about the game
each ninja only has a small amount of stealth kills to use
there are plenty of regular attacks to be diverse but only  stealthy kills
one kill is rarely used due to the fact that you have to be iun front of you r enemy to use it which is dangerous because he will see you
you usually do the neck slice yawn
another downside is that many of the ninja items you acuire will be useless
since you can only carry  you will take ninja stars bombs paralyzing rice cakes and the grapling hook
the others are junk or rare objects recieved as bonuses for completing the missions on a master ninja score
again the graphics are dated
the enemy ai is a pretty stupid
you can run past an ememy warrior and duck behind a bush or tree and he wont know where you went
he will look around himself quick and resume his patrols where are you
its still a load of fun and can be a challenge at first to get a perfect rating and unlock secret items
replay value is pretty darn good
you might get tired of it after beating it with both ninjas but you will get a taste for it some time later
this game will not sit in a closet
many ps games sit in my closet but this dated ps game is in my ps right nowgot this game today
i remember playing this game when i was younger
i was a better ninja back then
d i am a little rusty and horrible at stealth now compared to when i was younger
i miss this game so much i bought it
thanks for sending it in earlier than expected
di was brought into the tenchu series with wrath of heaven not a great place to start but after renting and eventualy buying the third tenchu instalment i made it a point to track down the originals
im writing this review in  a time of metal gear solids online splinter cells and innovative hitman games
yet this title released in  still impresses and is well worth effort of tracking it down and buying
some things a buyer needs to heed however is the lack of analog control
for gamers raised on analog controllers this game may be a little hard to manage at first
also the game which emphisises stealth and patience is not without a frustrating moment or two as the camera can be troublesome in places and there is no in game save feature try spending  hours working to get a good rank on a level only to be killed by the levels extremely difficult boss and be sent back to the begining
all together the game features an impressive aray of ninja weapons and items decient replay value two playable characters and a good story that sets the stage for several sequels
while it may feel simplistic to gamers hardened on newer stealth titles and the graphics may not feel as polished stealth assassins is a difficult chalenge and rewarding experience for anyone willing to overlook some simple flaws and who possesses a good deal of patience
i highly recomend itthis game rules this game is a classic and it rules
 out of  one of my favorites
but this is all nostalgic opinion still resident evil  i realized i hadnt written a review for my favorite game of all time
yes im not kidding
this game has it all
graphics check
still look good today in 
gameplay check
music check
gore and zombies check and check
it just doesnt get any better than this
i loved the original but when i got this game is when i got really hooked into the seriesthe game is filled with great atmosphere
theres no game that defines survival horror better than this one
this was capcom at the height of their powers
silent hill is a close second in the genre
resident evil  improved upon the original in many ways
the voice is a little better though it still has moments of cheese
the weapons look better and are upgradeable the game has two scenarios where your choices make slight differences in the other characters gameyes this game is survival horror royalty
get it i dont care what system you get it for but just get itin my opinion this is the best resident evil yet although i have still not played code veronica
if youre going to buy a playstation resident evil title get this one
it is by far the longest one alsoone of the best survival horror games of all time
if ya dont know now ya knowwe have every resident evil game we love the game and we love that the game was in great shape when we got it and how fast we got itturn the lights off and play re  to the very end
for me re was the best in series so farnow this is how youre supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody violent game
blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies
its so strange and relaxing to experience this
i know you will laugh at what i am about to tell you but i never bothered with this game when it first came out
yeah i know i lost many friends because of this
i ignored this game in  and my level of coolness went right down the tubes
i had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates againchildren shouldnt play this game
if you think its ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person
yes thats right you can walk through a police station in this game
if in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again you now have a place to take out your frustrations resident evil the weapons in this game are realistically cool
i like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces
dont try this at home but do try this on your playstation
the magnum doesnt make much noise so you wouldnt think itd be such a badass weapon but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens
you know you shouldnt do that in real life though right
youd go to jail for a very long time
and if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies youd only get laughed at by the entire court room
use your headif this game doesnt satisfy your sick animallike needs then try looking for the fire blaster thing
you can cook zombies with this
its near the end of the game hidden in a locker
go near the locker and press the x button and it will open and you will say sweetin this game you have two cds
one cd is for the leon adventure and the other cd is for the claire adventure
you can choose to start the game with either leon or claire
to do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with leon and twice with claire
ive only ever played this game on easy and i had a blast
im sure on normal its quite harder maybe so hard you cant think straight and become dumb
of course you arent dumb its just that video games can confuse you sometimesman im tired
but im never too tired to take a couple hours from my easygoing day and blasting my way through this super cool game
the only downside is that you cant skip the cutscenes
thats fine at first when you want to listen closely to the story even though i didnt but after a while you really wish capcom would have put a skip button on this thingstill great game
its old but please dont be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old its not good
ive been around people who think like that and they just aint cool
sure these people get all the girls and all the friends but what else
whats in sucks and whats old is cool
you think im wrong
good for you
buy this game used for  dollars todayresident evil  truly is a classic scare
resident evil  showcases just why the series became big and why resident evil is the leader of the survivalhorror genre by a landslide
resident evil  was just full of new ideas
the  discs and the  people to play as where each of their actions affect the other persons adventure for example was just amazingim also not kidding when i call this game a scare
resident evil  will have you on the edge of your seat and it may even have you wetting your trousers a bit at certain times
resident evil  is an essential pickup for any fan of the survivalhorror genre
resident evil  did so much for the genre that it shall be  remembered foreverre was my first zombie game andi fell in love with this franchise right off the bati grew up on a steady diet of sega genesis games then i went to the n and my love of all things mariothen i finally broke down and got a psre was one of the first games i got for the system and it completely changed my outlook on games foreveri had never played such an adult oriented game
not even mortal kombat came close to how r rated this game wasi was blown awayincredible graphics for the timeconstants scaresinteresting puzzles that really didnt make any sense and still dont lolwho cares they were still a blast to solve anywaya story line that rivaled the best hollywood has ever thrown at us regarding the horror genreim not going to go into complaints now as the game is rather olddid i have complaints at the timeonly onethe characters control like a walking tankall of this was corrected by re but thats about it for my complaintsone of the most influential games ever madeit brought adult gaming into the mainstream and proved that not all games have to have cute mascots
i still love my mario and sonic mind you
excellenceperfect in almost every way imaginablea must playhighest recommendationsive been playing the series since i was about  the first game i played was the remake of the first and resident evil
i also played the other series such as code veronica resident evil  resident evil revelations resident evil  nemesis  and resident evil  feel free to get the game its awesome but challenging at times
i highly recommend getting it
also it can work on a ps but you need the original playstation memory cardthis game is one of the only games to truly terrify me
the other being silent hill
check my review on that in upcoming weeks
the graphics are just right for this type of game although they could have been better
the control is muddy although never cumbersome
the weapons are alright but upgrading them is a hoot
i wish that you could upgrade more weapons though
an upgraded rocket launcher that could blow through doors now that would be really cool
oh well if i want to do that i should go play red faction
the zombies are as dumb as oxes but the lickers and dogs and the birds they are coming to get me
are fairly intelligent
avoid those at all costs if you know what is good fer ya
adioslolbryanreosbcglobalnet and i say that resident evil  is perhaps one of the best resident evils for the ps
the sheer horror of the initial run to the police station is just the beginning
then you must fight your way through the zombie infested maze
this game will have you jumping when you hear a noise outside
this is the game to get if you want to be scared for a few weeks after beating it
it took me about  hours i think it was perhaps  hours
but i like to make sure all the zombies are dead
this game is a must if you are a fan of rethe series of resident evil continues with its sequel resident evil  on playstation released in  and developed by capcom once again
it takes place in raccoon city which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game
this time the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the tvirus created by umbrella
you get to play as two characters leon s kennedy disc one who is a raccoon city police officer on his first day of the job and claire redfield disc two who came into town to search for her missing brother chris redfield who was one of the main characters in the first resident evil game
both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines but it doesnt matter what order you play them inthe gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game
you have to solve puzzles use a limited supply of ammunition herbs to heal wounds carry only eight items and use typewriters to save
its nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and i wish every resident evil game in the series was like thisyou get some new weapons such as a bowgun sub machine gun spark gun and upgrades to leons handgun shotgun and magnum
the aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot
one downside is that auto aim isnt set by default
when you start the game you have to press select to get to the options select the controller settings and set the mode to type c to turn the auto aim feature on
a nice new addition is that the characters current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed
this makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you dont have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game
the item boxes are back where you can store items you dont need and pick up later but a new item you can retrieve is the side pack which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten
both leon and claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story
leon is aided by a woman named ada wong who is searching for her boyfriend
claire is aided by a  year old girl named sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in raccoon city
but even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons
the enemies in this game are really memorable there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful especially later in the game
then theres mr x who is like the terminator he always comes back to hunt you downthe most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game
say you play as leon and complete the game as him well you can then play as claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending
and you cant play claires second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her you have to unlock it first
so in total there are four possible scenarios in this gameanother innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario the number of saves and healing items you use
if you do well you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun gatling gun rocket launcher unlock special outfits and three new mini games
the first mini game you play as hunk whose mission is to escape the raccoon city police department with the latest gvirus created by umbrella
the second mode is known as extreme battle in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the tvirus in umbrellas lab before it can cause a lot of damage
you get to play as four characters leon claire ada and claires brother chris
each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game
the third and final game mode is called tofu and it is the strangest mini game i have ever seen
you play as this giant block of tofu yes i am dead serious a giant piece of tofu and in terms of the objective its the same as hunks mission except you play as tofu who is only equipped with a combat knife so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete
ive completed the mode as hunk but never as tofu
the good news however is that tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run
dont even bother fighting the enemies the knife in resident evil  is just extremely weak and isnt worth the time
still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because tofu says some funny japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt
its funny even though i cant understand it
it is also pretty difficult to unlock you have to get an a ranking at least six times to play this mini game
for the extreme battle and hunk you only need two a rankingsone thing i didnt mention yet is that the music is really awesome
it has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well
there were many different versions of this game
there was an updated version on playstation called resident evil  dual shock edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the playstations dualshock controllers analog stick and vibration function
the extreme battle mode i mentioned is exclusive only to the dual shock edition
theres also a rookie mode which gives the player a machine gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game but you cant unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an a ranking you have to play normal mode to unlock them
another cool thing about the dual shock version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo
you just go to the control settings hold r and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red
this version was later released on the playstation store as a ps one classic on the playstation there were also ports on the pc and dreamcast with slightly better graphics higher frame rate and an art gallery
there was even a port on the game com
it was a sty d black and white handheld console by tiger
that port is just pathetic im not even going to discuss it
the best port however is the nintendo  version
the sound on the nintendo  version is better than the playstations version it has updated graphics new costumes a setting to adjust the violence and blood color a more responsive aiming control scheme new files cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety
the only thing its missing is the extreme battle mini game
but this port is equally as good as the playstations versionany criticisms i have with this game
well its hard for me to think of things i dont like about this game i guess a minor criticism is that you cant skip the in game cut scenes you couldnt do that in the first game and its a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like i did and just want to get through the game
the problem most people have with this game is the beginning
you start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun
the first time playing you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombies corner and kill you
it definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies
my strategy is to just run away
hold square press up on the dpad to run and use upleft and upright to get around the enemies
once you figure that out it isnt too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room
it did take me a while to figure out the controls but ive mastered it and you can too
the voice acting in this game is much better than the first resident evil but still nothing too special
thats about all the criticisms i can think ofwhen i was a kid i used to play the s out of this game and in my opinion this is undeniably not only the best resident evil game but the best survival horror game and one of the best playstation games i have ever played
this game still manages to be very scary if youre playing this for the first time you are guaranteed to be so scared your heart will burst out your chest
trust me i had my jumps even to this day
its more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark with the volume turned up
this makes for a terrifying and memorable experience
i absolutely love this game its just a masterpiece
id recommend getting the version from the playstation store to play on the ps for only  or the regular playstation version or the nintendo  version
those are the best options
the replay value is very high for me and i could play this game at any time
you will admire this game and its by far the best in the entire seriesi love playing this game on my ps
im not even going to get the gamecube version because its exactly the same as the good old psone version
very entertaining and mysteriousmy friends and i got this when it first came out so long ago in like  or something like that
might have been earlier too
anyways i played it through myself on leon first and the game had an amazing storyline and the rpg part of the game is amazing
there are a few challenging mini puzzles which can be very annoying much like zelda but once you get past them all is well again
i would highly recommened this game to anyone and compared to the gore they have in nowadays games this is nothingi bought this game the day it came outi was very impressed then and this game still impresses me todayilove the story and leon is my favort charicterthats why i am looking foward to re for gamecubecapcom followed up the surprise success of the original resident evil with this blockbuster smash in   resident evil  had everything the original had plus tons more bigger more detailed environments weirder puzzles more suspense more blood and gore and a compelling story that kept the gamer on the edge of their seat
in this installment you play as rookie cop leon kennedy or claire refield the sister of chris from the first game
instead of a secluded mansion like the first game this time all of raccoon city has been infected by umbrellas virus and you have to wade through an assortment of flesh eating zombies mutated dogs hunters a new monster called the licker whose introduction in the game is one of the most unforgettable parts in any video game and some unbelieveably grotesque beasts who will stop at nothing until your dead
resident evil  was an instant smash hit upon its release and has since been regarded as a classic video game and an essential play for any gamer
since then the game has been rereleased on other systems such as the dreamcast nintendo  and most recently the gamecube so now gamers of any generation can play one of the most addicting and innovative games of all timei just loved re  when it came out and even more scary then the first game
you play as leon kennedy or claire redfield
there is one area in the police station that when i went down a hallscared the hell out of me and made me actually jump from my chair
thats the type scare i enjoyit was that good because you didnt expect it
every time i play this game and come to that place in the game  never fails to make me jump this game has two hidden characters
plus based on who you play leon or claire you met two new characters in the gamei recommend this game to any fan of the resident evil seriesafter getting into  resident evil  i knew this game was out for a while now so i decided to pick it up  
it was a vast improvement over the first game 
the dialogue was much better aswell as  the graphics 
plus you could play as  different characters inthe same game but with different stories
plus new other features as well  these games are great to play over and over again
and you dont even need to cheat at them
plus being lots of fun  play rookie mode and have cool maching guns with tons of ammo for leon and play  resident evil nemesis  too 
it rocks man 
i now have to take out all  games to play again to drive my wife crazy 
so get it today 
you wont be bored with tons of dialog that you have to sit thru  like in rpg games
but you will love hearing the story unfold and kill zombies and other nasties 
so turn out the lites  and slay some undead ass this game was a great survival horror advernture
i still like  for some reason but this should be owned by every psx or gc owner
the story is very good and interesting
the game has two disks
each character has there own  versians
leon has  different ways of the game
there are the a and b games for each character
leon and clair have both as and bs
i like all versians even though the b gives you an extendid deed to do in the game and shows you the true resident evil game ending wich leads to the events to resident evil the game disks should take about  to  hours if you dont have a guid
the a and b games are both pretty difficult if you dont have a guid
the game is amazing and has a great character desighn like ada wong
sad how it ends for leon even thoe the b game leaves you wanderin about her during your fight with the new mutated tyrant in his b game
over all this is one of the best in the series next to  and remakeleon returns in the next resident evil game wich is in titledresident evil get  cause you wont be dissapointed
its a psx classic
i have bin playing that game since i got it and that was about in  wich is when it came outso go get it psx gamersthis game is precious because it introduced claire redfield leon s kennedy ada wong and sherry birkin
where would we be without claire leon and ada
they are a big part of what makes the resident evil series without them it wouldnt be nearly as good
the best part about this game is the leonada kiss in leons b scenario the second instalment of the classic resident evil series remains the biggest and the best
with four missions it is a massive game and each scenario adds its fair bit of challenge
the ending to the b scenario is mindblowing absolutely brilliant
there is a superb plot and it is great the way that the two scenarios ie
leon a amp claire b run parallel to each other and fit in with the storyline
some people say that this is a bit short but when you finally complete all four scenarios on easy and hard mode then you will truly appreciate the challenge that this game has to offer
there are extra games such as the hunk and tofu scenario that add even more depth and challenge to an already massive game
the police station gives a very atmospheric setting to the game and the new batch of monsters can also give you a hard time
this is a landmark game for the playstation and the whole resident evil series is fantastic
hopefully this quality of gaming can continue onto the playstation a bad ass game live the whole series on the game so far they did a great job on making these games and lost this one and had to have it againfew games have endured in my collection like resident evil  the graphics are old dated and painful in the year  where dead island and dead rising  are the dominant zombie games
but it looks well enough to play for days and months on end
the gameplay is clunky and clumsy but it is a horror game designed to make you feel inadequate and somewhat unprepared for the adventure you are thrown into
the story is scifi originals bad and in hard to understand but that was what they were going forhonestly everything about the game should not work
it does alot wrong but it does more right
yes it all meshes together into a really good game
yes in a few years it will be a painful to play as say pitfall for the atari but even when it is thriteen years old it is still fun to playi played it nonstop when i had my ps continued to play it with my ps and even now after i got an xbox  and play other games i still plug up my ps and play some re once and awhile
yes i can see the blocky graphics bad audio and ect but i love this game
its my favorite of all time
i can give you a detailed walkthrough right now for every scenario in the gameget this game if you love killing zombies
get it if you love puzzles
get it if you love guns
get this game periodresident evil  picks up a little after the original game in the series
the virus that the evil umbrella corporation has been researching managed to get out into the open and people have been dropping dead like flies as a result
the story begins when two central characters are separated in a car crash and both try to survive long enough to work out what on earth is going on in racoon city
it sounds like a very basic even threadbare plot and to tell the truth it is
but therein lies the charm of resident evil and most all of its sequels
one can go anywhere do anything kill anything and apart from the frustration of winding up with nowhere to go at times the game will not penalise the player for it
in this day and age where racing simulators are nothing more than knowing which lever to jerk when it makes for a nice changeof course as the main influence makes clear the player soon finds themselves battling with undead citizens and worse throughout the course of the game
those who like to kill everything in sight may find the going a little tough as the game rewards the player for knowing what to kill and when
a zombie in a wide open area does not require immediate shooting but a licker in a confined space should be put down as quickly and quietly as possible
knowing the difference can literally decide whether you complete this game or not
but if one does get into a situation where they are low on ammunition and are not sure where they are meant to go they can simply keep exploring until a solution presents itself
such is the quality of the artwork on offer that it takes a while for this to become boringone criticism of the game that is perfectly valid is that the zombie models only seem to have four varieties
occasionally different types will appear if certain conditions are met such as not picking up any items during the trip to the police station but for the most part it is a rather generic bunch
another problem is the save point system which can make the quest seem repetitive at times if resumed
however the fun of the game truly lies in revealing threads of the plot which while occasionally clicheacute is put together like an elegant series of chinese boxes
questions are raised constantly and half the fun is in finding the answers
in a complete contrast to the second feature film the motions and attacks of the enemy are completely consistent and even make sense from a biological point of view
one other criticism i have that applies to all of the resident evil games i have played to date is that in socalled tense moments when a massattack by zombies or other terrors begins one can often tell when they have completely beaten off their opposition by when the background music calms down
although i am not entirely sure that is a bad thingthe replay value of the game is heightened by the ability to complete one characters quest save the results and use them on the others
what one does in one game directly affects what happens in the other
decisions such as who should take the submachine gun for example are of great importance in the game as are such things as opening doors or killing certain major enemies
getting into the underground lab towards the end of the game is quite a chilling moment too
notwithstanding the fight that takes place on the way down this deserted research lab is enough to put the wind up any a dedicated viewer of horror films
a contrast as it were to the godawful second film adaptationif i were giving resident evil  a score it would be ten out of ten
sure it is looking old considering it was originally released on the playstation and dreamcast but unlike the vast majority of games it has the ability to withstand the test of time
it is well worth hunting around the stores that specialise in secondhand or liquidated stock forthis game has very good graphics for a ps game and the action and musicthe game is very good and has  worldsalthough theyre shortwhat i dont like is thatyou can only save when you pass a worldand thats bad because if youre doing perfect in the world but then you dieyoull have to do it all over againthe game has hands up and conso i recommend it if you like zombie killinghorror action gamesthis is a fun gamethere are some better games in the history of playstation gamessuch as crash bandicootwarpedwhich is not violentlike this is just a littlebut its great enough to be given at least  starsthis is one of the most enjoyable games ive ever had the pleasure to play 
it is fairly simple  not to mention loads of fun too 
there are only a few hard bosses  but worth the playing time 
one tip  always stock up on ammo  and use the fountain of rejuvination always throw your drumsticks at enemies for health pickups but you get them later in the game
use your crossbows for bosses and pay close attention to the books scattered thru the levels they give you cluesall in all if you you want tons of fun  then get this game
you ll certainly play it over and over again so i was seting up for the next stream and then i found this lying around i started to remember oh man this game was a lot of fun so i started to play it again and it still is fun today
so here i am sitting here on amazoncom and figured well since my next stream is going to be for a playstation game why not this first
medievil is a hack and slash game involving the undead but unlike popular games that involves zombies in some way like resident evil this one is lessrealistic
the game has a cartoon feel and the back of the box even says that i usually love cartoons and this one fits the bill in terms of both comedy and graphics
the story is that there is this story teller for a king who kind of went off the deep end by saying he slain an evil wizard named zarok
zarok who overhears this decideds to declare war and horrified by this and believing in fortesques the story teller story he sends him out to battle but daniel goes down at the first shot with a welhelm scream and everything
 years later zarok returns but so does fortesque but this time the cowardly knight is a skeletal onemedievils controls are a little awkward but once you get the hang of them it becomes quite nice the atmosphere of this game is dark and gritty but not too much
as i said before the gameplay is a hack and slash type thing like god of war but less gory much much much much much less gory than that game and it does throw around puzzles
the game does beg for you to get every single chalice collectables by throwing in a lot of challenges that can make it easier to complete if you have a certain weapon such as enemies having an insane amount of health and would take literally forever to kill with your second to strongest sword
because of this getting a  on this game is really easy and there is no bad ending for doing a no chalice run if you so wish to do sothe music is outstanding and some of it is memorable one of my favorite tracks is the ending theme of this one the music is compose of a synthesizer and other normal instrumentsso how would i rate this game well i think this game is perfect and is and always on the number one spot of my top ten list of favorite games of all time
for that this game gets a  stars from me music gameplay and graphics are always great and the controls are a bit awkward as i said but once you get used to it then this game is a blast
all hail sir daniel fortesqueso much funmy husband and i played this game til we all but wore it outwe still have it and now that were back into gaming again intend tohook up the ps and play it still
its just that goodi wish someone would come out with an updated version for the wii or laterbc wed def buy itas part of the core team at sony computer entertainment that worked on the development of the crash series and helped propel naughty dog into the video game industry as a premier developer with these million seller crash games
im proud of what we did and i still enjoy the crash bandicoot gameplay and graphics
buy them up folks
i had to buy these because my little girl gave my copies to her little friends back in the s
i hadnt given it much thought until now and realized that i just had to have my own copies again
yes i still have playstation     consoles and will buy the second generation psthis item was purchased as a gift for my grandson it was requested by him and his mother they both love the game
it has worked flawless since they received itgreat game fun old classic very basic and easy to catch on to
much funner than the first onei gave this to a young man as a gift
he is very excited about the game and has enjoyed it very much
he is happy and thinks it is just what he wanted
i am not familiar with the product but if he is happyi am happyyou can not miss the chance to own one of this if you like crash bandicoot gamesi have never managed to beat the game cant imagine how some people claim to do so in  hours
my  year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation
she was getting frustrated with crash until i found the code that allows you to go to any level and play
plus if you go to the castle machinery level first you get  some free lives and then can go where you want
find the password screen and punch in ttriangletttxssquarettttsxtotttostxxxx
maybe it is cheating but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game it makes playing it more funthis game took me quite a few tries to get but now that i got it i played the heck out of it
one of my faves for i have the nd and third part
i just wish someone could tell me how to go about getting all the gems after u defeat cortex on this first part i got herewhen famous sonic was out now enter bandicoot
this story tell about myster that can be destoryed a dr neo cortex was a mad scitent  which ordered nitus brio to create a animals but now cortex have created the bandicoot which can be there leaderall animals where out of control only crash survies konwing that cortex was a bad guy now he most jonury throrugh places to get back to cortex fortessthis is the second best crash
the best is crash  the complaints what people will go on are being able to move backwards and forwards like a d game well it was back in  or so
the game isnt hard until  throughbuy this if you want a very good platformerthis is one hard game
but it is nicely designed thought in some ways
people may say that the save system and difficulty of levels are not good
but in my opinion they are just fine
the save system is the worst i have ever seen but it just makes the game that much harder
the way it works is for most levels there is a bonus level
once you finish that level which dissapointingly is very short you can save the game
but not all the levels have this bonus level which makes it really hard
you have to get through a few levels in some cases to get to a bonus level
and the thing is each time you load the game it starts out with four lives no matter how many you had when you saved
so that makes it really hard
what you have tio do is play the levels in the beginning to rack up lives
but get this once you play the level once and collect all the lives you cannot collect many more
if you play it again you will not be able to get as many lives as before
the boxes normally filled with lives are now just filled with fruit
collect  and get another life
but that takes a while
and also you can only play the bonus level once
if you save the game and try to play it again you cant
so you really have to work hard
pacman world is so much easier than this
with this you really will get frustrated
it is not as fun as pacman world or crash bandicoot  that is a better game than this one
but for a first try the company did a good job
the music is one of the best things in this game
crashs powers and moves are limited though but the graphics are good for  it is  i know but it is not too late to buy this game if you have a playstation  or  but be ready for a challengeim semi serious about this
this game is tough
its an excellent platformer one of the all time best for that matter but some of the levels are rage inducingcrash is the perfect mascoticon for sony and they let him go
at the time when sony needed one crash was there and sold systems
he was the face of playstation and its baffling why they didnt hang on to him
just ask nintendo or sega what the advantages of a mascot are
nintendo is dead without mario and after many failed attempts sega is still trying to resurrect sonic
crash was perfect for sony
hes funny has attitude likable and recognizable and the games were the first really good d platformers for the next generation
he also provided a stable franchise for the younger audience which every company knows they want and need
what happened here
man i remember the commercials when a guy in a crash outfit went to nintendo headquarters and stood outside with a bullhorn and was taunting mario daring him to come out
classic
that was crash
sony really dropped the ball herecrash has never been the same since naughty dog let him get away
other developers have made some very uninspired sequels with him changing his looks alliances and even voice
i know you cant do the same thing forever but none have come close to the success of naughty dog when they held the reins of this franchise
today crash sits in a woeful state being made to participate in very uncrashlike gamesthis game started it all though
this changed the platformer forever
while mario and sonic were still going left to right in their side scrolling adventures crash took us into his world with glorious d
it said something about the future of games and consoles at the same time and it was only on playstation
even today this is a very challenging platformer
amidst the ratchets jaks slys and d marios and sonics the original crash is about as tough as there is
but its also compelling enough to want to keep going
you never dont know how your going to get through the level theyre linear afterall its getting the right timing and touch to do what needs to be done
there are some truly insane levels here that will test all your patience and nerve
but youll just want to keep trying at least till you get to your next save point so you know you dont have to do the level again that you just did
fortunately theres plenty of fruit and extra lives but your gonna need them allthe audio video and play mechanics in the original crash trilogy are spot on
these games still look sound and play great today
theyre a very few of the only original psone games i can bare to look at let alone play anymore
the look is perfect with bright colors and varied enviornments and the music and sounds are catchy and perfect for each stage
these games have aged extremely well and are a real tribute to the developers at naughty dogthere are a couple of downsides though
these games are really tough maybe too tough for the average gamer or especially child
some of this is intentional design and some i feel maybe the fact that d platforming was in its infancy at this time
some of the angles on jumps just seem a little off
the perspective can make it really tricky
another problem is that the save points can be a little far between
not the check points during the levels they are plentiful and life saving but the save points
sometimes i just wanted to finish a level id been on for a while save and quit
but then id find that i had to go through another whole level and a half just to get the bonus roundsave point
and even the bonus round was tricky sometimes as its set up as a mini level requiring you to get from one side to the other but if you fell along the way youd have to restart the level to get back to it
again more challenge and patience testing
my final complaint is that sometimes youd have a nice number of lives youve accumulated from previous levels say  or so you save come back and you only start with 
i want my lives i earned them
on a final note i downloaded crash on my ps but cant save as it wont even though ps games do so i have to use passwords
its a little annoying but if they didnt provide them then id really never be able to savefor anyone new to crash looking to try it out dont let any of this put you off
these the first  are fantastic games overall
theyre among the tip top in the platforming genre and are some of the most challenging but rewarding at the same time
crash is truly a gaming icon and i hope some way somehow that his original developers can one day give him and us another grand adventure worthy of the name crash bandicootthe original crash
what a wonderful game
it revolutionized the gaming console
created by the naughty dog team that went on to create what some consider the greatest ps game of all time uncharted  crash is a non stop adventure loved by kids and adultsi love this game so much because it reminds me of my childhood
i played it for a little bit when i got it but just love the classic style game overall
cant go wrong for a classic ps gamethis video game is just great in every way
i am a huge crash bandicoot and none of the crash game i played beats the original
this game introduced a whole new way of video games and has great graphics for a psone game
i would recommend this game to anyone old or young as anyone can just pick up this game and play ita very good classic game
i started off playing crash bandicoot warped so i had to buy the original and play it
this was a pretty easy game to beat but it was fun playing the game that started it allhaving helped bring the series to fruition back in the s i had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them
the developer naughty dog had a great idea and we at sony helped them succeed
i love the gameplay the graphics the music and the humor
lots of great animations and funny sounds such as oombadegha
youll just have to play the game to find out what im talking about
im proud to have been a part of the success of this series
the real tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love
oombadeghaah crash  one of my favorite games as a little kid
its much better than the originalgameplay  levels  hidden  crystals  gems and a bunch of secrets
the warp room allows you to choose  levels at a time
there are many weird secrets
like in the first level once you get the regular gem return to level one and dont break any boxes
you will get the blue gem
plus you can save any time unlike the original
and you dont have to not die to break all of the boxesgraphics very good for a  game
everything looks greatmusicsound the music is very catchy and the voices are decentoverall a great platformer for the playstation
a must haveps you can refight bosses
if you have beaten a boss hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him againthey told me i wouldnt get this game for at least another  weeks and i got it three days laterawesome thank you i used to play this game for hours back in my days and had wondered if it was still aroundsure enough it wasi have joy againgraphics   really neat little things you might not notice
sometimes a little too computerized but still eyecatchingsound   very much improved from the first crash bandicoot
when things hit the ground they make a bang when creatures talk its amazingly clear and when youre in danger you certainly know by the sound a creature is making the rumbling of the ground or the thrilling scorevalue   this is one game you will start repeatedly and still have the same enjoyment level every time you playoverall   a big improvement from the great first game
crash bandicoot  cortex strikes back has it all  story characters levels and fantastically constructed colouring and visualsok this is not a junky review i have been a gamer for more than  years and still gaming strong now a quick review simple and fast for those who dont like to read a lot just get it if you love action adventure platform games
now for proselements to reviewgame play     definitely a lot to do on part  great assortment of power and new moves the crativity invested in the artisting side and levels design its superb the game introduces a new way to increase the challenge of trying to get everything in the game as usual the controller configuration in the cb series its simple and easy to get use to the comedy makes a better experience during frustation times if you liked the first cb get this one nowplot dont expect a final fantasy twisted style story plot here in a few words n cortext is back and tricks his greatest creation crash to get him the so well known crystals to power up his inventiongraphics   for being a play station one game the graphics engine rocks
the light effects water fire and of course crystal glass its awesome no doubt one of the best looking games in the pso librarychallenge    it all depends if you just want to fly throug the game without the secrets and stuff this will be a piece of cake but trying to get all the relics in platinum then get ready with a lot of patience
this is were the game grows to a greater difficulty  or a real gamefinal word   try to get the original trilogy and well just get it if you dont like it give it to me p see yathis is where the crash bandicoot games got really really good
everything that the first game got wrong the second game got it right
the second game was released in  as a playstation exclusive called crash bandicoot  cortex strikes back obviously reference to star wars the empire strikes back
this game is also available on the playstation store as a ps one classic to be played on either the playstation  playstation portable or playstation vita for only  so id recommend getting that version if you are interested
developed by naughty dog published by sony computer entertainment and distributed by universal interactive studios the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way
the second game takes place immediately after the first one as doctor neo cortex survives the battle against crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the cortex vortex to take over the earth
he decides to abduct crash bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the earth
we also meet crashs sister coco who is suspicious of cortexs true intentions
meanwhile doctor nitrus brio who was cortexs right hand man wants crash to gather gems so he could destroy cortex and the cortex vortex orbiting earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us all with different intentionsthe gameplay is a platformer in which you control crash bandicoot across  levels to gather crystals and gems
the game takes place in a series of six warp rooms which as the hub areas of the game
each warp room contains five portals leading to a level
the goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path
crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates or in bonus levels or secret levels once you obtain the crystal or gem you have to reach the end of the level if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal you will lose it
i guess they made it that way to be hard
once you obtain all five crystals in a warp room you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next warp room however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access
ripper roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when crash hurts him i cant help but laugh at this
then theres the fight with tiny tiger across floating platform that drop the goal is to have tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls i love that
i was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy but whateverthe gameplay is like the first game except with new controls crash can now slide across the ground perform a body slam crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places
some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice
the boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems
but whats nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game
a new famous box is the nitro boxes which explode upon any physical contact but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the nitro boxes in the level once struck
the game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes extra lives and even gemsas a kid i played the s out of this game
it was only recently i managed to beat it  because it is both challenging and fun but its easier than the first game so if you were expecting a greater challenge you will be disappointed but the controls smoother gameplay and the fact you can save anytime you want as long as you are in the warp room makes this game a far superior game than the first onefinal rating  out of nd to this is crash  the graphics are still greati got this in and so are the levels
the saving is alot better
i think that you cant compare this to crash  and on ps because its so much more memorablebuy itthis is what got me started
i started off with crash bandicoot  when it first came out
i love the whole concept of it and the games are soo fun
its exciting and all the levels are different they have been so creative its amazingi love crash and cannot wait until it comes out for pscrash goes along a little faster in a good way
not as slow to start out as one
it also has the same fun characters the same fun box smashing and running
lots of fun great for kids and adults a super fun game for the whole familylater in installments crash changed
there was ctr or crash team racing which is fun if you like racing and even if you dontbut its not about finding boxes and getting through areas like the originals
later there is one where you and a friend can play at once titans i think and  its my very least favorite
there is also crash bash love that one so fun super for family time
but not the same story line type as the early onesthis one is just more of what you loved about crash bandicoot the firstsuper fun for the whole family will keep your kids busy and entertained for hours and hours
totally replayable can last for years if you love crashin fact i always tended to enjoy this one more than the previous due to the fact that they made it less frustrating at timesin this game crash helps cortex to save the world by collecting crystals despite the fact that crashs sister coco knows cortexs true intentions
however crash doesnt know until near the end due to a terrible signal qualitythe gameplay and design has changed a lot with this title
crash can now use the circle button to duck slide when moving and crouch jump
there are less levels but they are divided into five warp rooms with five levels each with a bonus warp room included
plus you can actually save whenever you pleasealong with these there are also more level settings whether it would be the woods the cold the sewers even the ruins
remember when you rode the hog in the first game
well this time you ride a polar bear cub insteadyou still collect gems in this game but the mandatory ones are the crystals mentioned before in each level which are easy to obtain
you still will receive a box gem for destroying every box even the new nitro boxes which should not be touched until you reach the green 
switch except you can use up as many extra lives as you want and still get the gem as long as each box is destroyed
the color gems still serve the same purpose even though there are only  the gems are more challenging to get and will still give you a reason to keep playingwhile this game may seem a bit short it is still a fun platformer released in the ps daysthis game is mad fun gets harder as you go along on the levels and some levels seem to be impossible to flip but thats the way its suppose to bei recommend thisi think this game is more than most of the review make it out to be
this game is supposed to be challenging and it is not as frustrating as most think
its actually really adorable and has a good setting with cute characters
the camera mode you do have to fiddle with though
but you do get used to it
i was definately hooked on this game cute challenging and fun
 stars all the waythis is completely for you this game consists of many things that make it an awesome classiclots to collect stars on this
this is a platform game so theres much to collect such as white crystals they are like your health bar get hit once lose them all but you get about  seconds to pick them up again after that poof their gone gobbos their hidden all over every level theres  in total  in the main area and  in the secret challange area to get to this you have to collect  color crystals to unlock a special door theres also keys in some levels small silver keys are usually to unlock a small cage contaning a button to open a door  or a gobbo jumping around speaking its snout off but in some cases theres no switch for this look for a large gold key that will usually open a door with a gold keylock on it the key will dissapear after use stars on thisthe controlls are quite comfortable exept this difficulty that haunts me through the whole game is the camera angels it dosent let you adjust it appently it ajusts itself in a in a pretty dumb way which makes it hard to jump from platform to platform making it frustrating to repeat over and over but that can be overlooked with the awesome gameplay  stars on this i love the bosses from some that chase and tackle you to some that shoot fire and ice bolts at you some that jump at you from the water not to mention the obstacles like when jumping little fire balls with faces running around a platform or flame or ice blotches jumping up from the ice river or lava river so be carefull when jumping characters are really cute not much violence in this game but dont be fooled its a pretty tough game itl take a while to beat  so this isnt only for kids this game is just so well put together i love the music its so calming and relaxing the story is deep without having many cutsceens and the graphics are pretty nice has a few difficulty not as seamless as they say but it still has pretty clear graphics its just plain awesome oh wait your waiting for cons right there are none
just the whole camera angle thing but its not much value on the scale of awesomeness so go out get this it will last very long months of entertainment if you want  oh and not to spoil anything but theres special jigsaw puzzle peices that unlock a secret
well i cant say read the manual and see where it takes you enjoy this great classici saw doom for the first time about  years ago when a friend of mine was playing it on his computerand up until that point playing old bit nintendo games summed up a fun day for me
dont get me wrong and im not knocking some nes classics here at all by any means but i must say i fell in love with doom the moment i saw it
too bad the  was so hooked too that he wouldnt let me playsofast forward to the release of the playstationand the eventual release of doom
i bought doom the first day it came outand my playstation wasnt turned off for  straight hours
i absolutely love firstperson shooter type games and aside from rise of the triad the first fps i ever played doom turned my world upside downthis is by far the best video game on the planethell in the universethe translation from the pc to the playstation was flawlesshell in my opinion its even better
you get all of the doom and doom ii levels and an additional  secret levels custommade for the playstation only
thats  total levels of mayheman immersive quest that you can not tear yourself away fromsure by todays standards the graphics are primitive and full of sprites and look a little blocky when youre up closethe enemies and items are modeled in d meaning you can never look at their backsideand heck you cant even jumpbutwho cares
this game is heaven and even today will still scare the  out of youeven if you memorized the location of every enemy in the game knowing what to expect around every cornerdont believe me
well try this situation on for size you just cleared out a room full of imps and sergeant zombies with every last round of shotgun ammo you had
you turn the next corner and hellotheres a baron of hell
change weapon to bfg  you only have enough ammo for one shot
you aim shoot and barely hit the moron
hes still coming at youand as you cycle through your weaponsyou notice only your pistol has ammo left
oh 
runsthat right there is the definition of funexcitementand horrorall making this game the number one video game of all time out of and yes i did that on purposeas doom is more than perfectafter the success of wolfenstein d and the birth of the firstperson shooter genre the intelligent creative teams at id software would forge ahead with an even deeper game doom
john romero is hailed for this classic game of monster hunting
read on to see why this is a classicthe goodwell obviously its the granddaddy of the genre
you get an array of weapons my personal favorite being the chainsaw
theres nothing better than chopping up a red demon and watching the blood scatter
the music is also very eerie as if something is about to pop out at you even though it never does to the extent of lets say silent hill
even though the graphics are outdated the level designs are very well done and many of them are tricky and cleverly designed
these guys wanted you to work hard to pass a leveli also must add that the controls are very customizable
if you dont have doom for your computer this is your best bet on the console
after all this has doom doom ii and ultimate doomthe badare you kidding
its doomoveralleven outdated this game stands the test of time
you have games today not all of them im not being politically correct so bite me
that all you do is you guessed it kill people
doom not only had you kill monsters and with bloodlust you had to find the right key to open the door face more monsters lurking behind it and work your way through seemingly endless labyrinths
sound hard
yes but thats the idea this is a prime example of the way a firstperson shooter game should be done
its a shame that future games didnt follow a similar formula although red faction and halflife are your best bets of today
in any case doom is a classic and should never be forgotten
grab your bfg and perhaps a rocket launcher and hunt this game down
you wont regret itits an unfortunate fact that people are looking to games like the call of duty series to fill their gaming demands when people are also forgetting that this little game called doom is  of few reasons that firstperson shooters like call of duty actually existwolfenstien d another piece from id software was the first real conception of firstperson shooters and then doom popularized the genre by id throwing in d and d sensibilities practically threw in everything you could saydoom is an adventure fps where you play a space trooper trying to figure out what the heck is going on as monsters and demons of hell invade earth and then your motivation is to shoot em down with weapons andor mow em down with a chainsaw simple as that
i cant tell you how many times i would walk around an area and have monster jump out at me or walk into a dark area in the game only for something to suddenly jump out
yes this game is scaryeven though the game has dated graphics it still stands the test of time as a true classic and a great investment to anyone willing to play thisthis game broke new ground for the video game industry and not just for the violence but for the environments and gameplay
this ps game is doom and doom ii bundled into one and its great
playing it on a psx or ps is just as good if not better than playing it on a pc
its a blow to political correctness everywherelove it or hate it doom was indeed one of the most controversial and popular games of the early s due to its violent content and satanic imagry
doom was among some of the violent games that were blamed for the shooting at colombine high school in denver colorado
doom was even ordered to be banned by religious protestors
but despite all that doom is still one of the hottest shooting games in us its my favorite game on the pc
i play almost every day on my computer at home
i would love to own this game on the playstation because it is by far the best version of doom ever
i rented it from one of my local movie rental stores and loved it
the graphics are pretty good the sounds and music are very eerie and the animation is excellent
and just like on the pc version all of the weapons levels enemies and cheat codes are here
if you play this game and love it also get final doom for playstation
those who are offended by lots of satanic imagry and bloody action should steer cleari cant say anything about doom that has already been said only complainant is due to the fact that its on a console it had to cut out levels  parts of levels out
its of course a fps it basically made the st person shooters popular cause like every other game now is a dntilde fps
but in doom you have to solve puzzles find key cards it just wasnt about running  gunning
its got a simple but effective story in space scientist are experimenting with portals the demons from h come through  all h breaks loose
eventually the demons come to earth  you have to stop the invasion
i cant do the game justice but yes if you never have played doom its a great game  you go to war with your mm shotgun double barrel shotgun rotary cannon rocket launcher plasma rifle  the big fing gundoom
the playstation rerelease of the  classic and also including the expansion ultimate doom and its sequel doom iiin this day in age its not that hard to take first person shooters for granted
theyre everywhere in every shape and form on every system literally clones of clones in a sense
whats even harder now is spotting the true gems that stand out within the genre
however back in  the fps was unheard of commercially and as difficult as it is to believe the genre was a major revolution to gaming
out of nowhere the company id software showed up and introduced wolfenstein d the first real fps
while it does stand as a gaming milestone of the early s it didnt quite take off in the public
what did succeed however was their next project which consisted of heavy weaponry lengthy levels demon slaughtering bfg s and key collecting the legendary doomanyone who first experienced the game back in its height of popularity knows that doom wasnt just a game but a phenomenon
it has always consumed gamers and continues to do so into its ever addicting gameplay without compromise
the premise here is really simple a base on mars is attacked by demons through a portal from hell and so the higher ups send the whole military platoon in to take care of the situation while you stand guard at the portal entrance
of course everyone gets wiped out except for you and now its your job to go in and eliminate every last one hells minions
yeah its a dumb story and it was eventually improved drastically with doom  many years later but the one aspect that makes these older doom games superior to doom  is that its simplistic storyline allows you to pick up the game from the getgo
theres no minute cg cutscenes to introduce the game to you
theres no hourlong tutorial demonstrating how to play the game
no immediately upon starting youre thrusted right into gameplay and quite honestly i wouldnt have it any other way
doom is to d what contra is to d gaming an instant immersive and entertaining experience albeit somewhat mindlessof course most halo and unreal tournament gamers of today will blindly slag off doom simply because the game is old and because of its archaic graphics
yes the graphics do date this game a bit plus its bloody violent visuals look a lot more like a cartoon now than it did ten years ago but people need to wake up and realize that a game is not fun solely based on how great the graphics are
the visuals are primitive but you wont really care once you become immersed in the gameanother common complaint about doom from people now is that all you do is shoot monsters and collect keys
true newer fpss offer different things to do but people take dooms simplicity merely at face value and they seem to miss the point
one thing that doom has on most other fps games is in its ingenious level designs
the creators really took the time to make its monsters levels and the overall experience memorable in a way that makes you want to come back for more
the differences between doom and doom ii may only seem like cosmetic upgrades but as the games go along the mazes become more and more intricate and cleverly designed
having story missions and goals to complete is fun but not at the expense of completely nonlinear gameplay
doom never skimps out on this aspectobviously the pc versions of the games are the best ones to play but for those who happen to have a psps and caught onto doom at a later date this version will give you a real bang for your buck
with  games and an expansion the whole package here offers about  levels and  difficulty levels of nonstop action
one thing that is improved from the pc version is the sound
all the sound effects and monsters have improved noises and all the droning level songs from the pc are replaced by an atmospheric at times errie background soundtrack
as a doom player for many years now i believe this makes doom that much better
plus the game feels very natural with a ps controller
also if you can ever find  pss a link cable  doom games and  tvs the multiplayer option is well worth itwhile other fps games after doom added a few new things here and there very few were able to capitalize on dooms greatest strength which is its design
in fact the only other fps series to really impress me besides doom is halflife
i know that this review sounds like a bunch of praise but a lot of the popular complaints are really nothing but hot air
however i do wish that you could save the game via memory card instead of having to copy down passwords
thats my only gripe though
i give doom my highest recommendation to open gamers looking for a challenge and a way to kill time
its one of my alltime favorite games
in time you too will agree that theres nothing quite like taking out a room full of zombie soldiers with a single doublebarrel shotgun blast jumping out of your seat as a group of angry imps pops out of a monster closethahaha and dodging ferocious attacks by barons of hell while you find health and attempt to take them out with a shotgunreplayability very high
its doom
thats all that needs to be saidother recommendationsfinal doom pcpsdoom  pchalflife pchalflife  pcjediknight dark forces ii pcdoom grand theft auto  final fantasy  wolfenstein d resident evil and metal gear solid there are my favotite games of all time
doom is definately a classic the first time i played it on the computer i was hooked
theres no telling how many hours i spent on this
as of many i bought doom the first day it came out on playstation years ago
so too all you halo players that have no clue what doom is about everytime you play halo keep in mind that if doom never existed most likely halo wouldnt exist
the whole doom series is definately worth owning
the graphics and sounds are now way out of date but at the time they were amazing
this has some of the most complex levels imaginable itll keep you entertained for hours
so many games today are like so many other games
the ones that are special are the ones that stand out
this game took a risk to be different and now it stands as being one of the best games ever createddoom and quake have been two of the most incredible fps series ever
along with turok and halflife and even medal of honor doom is still one of my favorites
i dont even own it anymore and last time i played it i was about six
while you were all watching barney the dinosour my dad and i were blasting demons with rocket launchers and taking out whole armies with a shotgun
i think doom  is really just a remake of doom  but if i had to choose between the two id likely choose this one
doom  is awesome and very addictive but its so realistic it tends to often freeze up a lot and dont even get me started on quake  but anyway doom was probably the first fps game i ever played although with my age i wasnt really good at it at first
but if i were to play it now id probably be halfway through the game in one day
i never even played doom ii though my dad did show me the first level of it a long time ago
i wish id would come out with another game like this with a simpler story and gameplay thats simple like this
i miss these old games a great deal and not owning doom anymore is beginning to hurt my brain
theres just no originality anymore with anything nowadays it seems like too many things are stereotypical or just plain typical
old games are the best and we need to make sure we get all the classic old games like this while we can because they wont be there foreverthis worked just fine
as it was for my daughter i had to have her check it out as this is all greek to me
thank youfor yearsdoom has been labeled as an evil video gamewith extreme violence and satanic imagerybut i say hold on a sec herei am a christian myselfand i absolutley love this gamewhy you may ask
because you get to destroy demons that are straight from hell
i mean come on
what christian wouldnt wanna love doing that in a video game
its not like you shoot peoplelike in the grand theft auto gamesonly people you shoot are fellow marines who are evil and sold out to satan
so christiansplay with an open mind and understand the true meaning of this game
it is good vs evilover the past few years i have experienced many doom ports and most of them were failures
big failures
but before i go into the review ill tell what i expected out of this game
i expected this to be highly intense packed full of action and it to be faster than the original pc versions
but did this really live up to be what everyone expected
answer is heck yeah
this port is somewhat better than the pc versions
it has higher resolution much more faster and even scarier than the pc versions
people kept complaining that  oh my god this music sucks
well in case you didnt know it wasnt supposed to be that weird music
this totally fits the feeling of the game
another thing they say is  they should have just made a direct port from the pc to the playstation
wow do we really need another pc port doom
i dont think so
they have made a billion other pc ports
we really do need another huh sarcastic
so you see this game did live up to peoples expectations
at least it did for me
yet some people might beg to differ
so grab this game today and have some bloody funto begin this review firsthand if youre the hires fps and all those sophisticated functions make you happythen by all means enjoythe graphics are d and you cant duck behind rocks to shoot or yield two weapons at a timethis is oldschool babyso why rate this game so highly you might askwell heres why i like this particular doomyoull get ultimate doom and doom iiwhich was a dynamite sequel with  levelsthats a lot of game time
doom in general is just pulsing with atmospherefrom a listening perspective you can hear the monsters growling or the raspy sounds of the imps down the hall which does mess with your head especially if theyre blindsiding youflickering lightsstumbling into a room thats completely and full of monstersor hitting a switch that unleashes a ton of monstersdefend yourself or diethe dark mood that doom provides is very thick for early s fare
some people think for an old game like this theres lifeless brown or grey colored levels on flat land without even playing itnot truepentagrams everywherecorpses impaledwalls made from fleshscrolling walls made from intestinesi think its the eighth level on doom i you meet the barons of hell in the center a starshaped room thats like a temple most unexpectedlycaught me completely off guard first time i ever played doom and never forgot itthats one thing about the older doom gameschockful of surprising moments
the enemies of doom i were good but doom ii they just added more to the roster that were literally far tougher and could kill you quick if you werent on your toesmass quantities of monsters coming at you at once as the doom series i always found to possess the most intense battles youll come across on a fps gamethats not to call any of the newer games weak but by going d but id software was just able to dish out much more when it came to traps and high volume monster shootingconclusionthe controls were decently laid outaudio remastering did the trickas far as im concerned this the inquiry of if its as good or better than the pc version or not because its an obsolete game graphics wisethe framerate is pretty smooth to me and the graphics are spot on to mea bad version of doom was for the sega x that was a very stripped down and clearly stuck out like a sore thumb to the pc versionthe ps version is an awesome alternative and is worth havingstarsjet moto sonys answer to wave race  was an instant hit for singletrac back in  singletrac best known for its twisted metal games set out to make a futuristic racer in the vein of both wave race  and wipeout and succeeded
players control riders on hoverbikes which hover close to the ground and can be driven over land and water
the game utilizes a system called the magnetic grapple in which pressing an assigned button creates a magnetic attraction between the players bike and red energy poles that are placed throughout the courses
this enables the rider to swing around tight turns with his bike without slowing down
if done properly it helps players cross gaps to large to get over as well as propelling riders out of turns alot faster than when going in
chracters are split in teams with bikes adorned with logos of sponsors just like in reallife racing
 characters and  tracks are available at the beginning with seven more tracks unlockable by winning tournamentsjet moto is best known by fans for its suicide courses
tracks have a point a and point b racers begin at point a racing to point b and back again all the while facing other oncoming racers coming towards them
its also known for its somewhat outrageous track structure mixed in with traditional coursesi fondly remember setting up all night on the weekends with friends playing this game just to see who had bragging rights when the night was over
most of the time theyd win but every once in awhile i would win
ill admit it took alot to beat this game
i love this game and still play it to this dayme and my friends used to play this game non stop for hours at a time when it first came out
it was so addicting and so much fun playing with friends
you can even upgrade your bikes i think
such a fun gamethis is the game that got me through medical school
i still play from time to time and definately when old friends get together
the physics is fantastic
the strategy is to maximize your inertia
turbo on long straightaways
turn as little as possible
of course you do have to turn quite a bit
once you have won the season you get to do stunt races where certain stunts recharge your boost
after mastering the game it is still fun to try and race for times whole course under  min is good or race against a friend
the sequal jm   is also great jm  i was never crzy about but it looks cool for ps graphicsgreat game
i havent played the other ones yet but i really like this one a lot
you get ms pacman digdug galaxian phozon and the tower of duraga
digdug is my favorite out of these and all are fun but some can get a little boring after a while
the graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag
i really like the theater and the library that is in it too
overall i really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games
cant wait to get the other volumes some timemspacmangalaxianpole position digdugphozontower of druagaretraction from my review of namcomuseum vol i somehow forgot that digdug was included in vol and erroneously entered it as included theirein
however at  games it is still the best value of the series
i now return you to your regularly scheduled game review already in progressthese games are of course perfectly emulated and a joy to play alone or with familyone thing i neglected to mention about the pole position titles in this volume and the firstif you play these games with the obscure namco playstation controller called the negcon you will have the absolute best controls of the game outside of maybe the arcade cabinets themselves
they may also support other racing wheel controllers
great for the whole familyplays on playstation this is a great nastalgia gamer who knows how it all began when pacman was first played on the commodore  and amiga computers
now today its even hotter then ever
new generations as well as old are at it again going pacwild with the whole pacfamily games
i will never get tired of pacman and mrs pacman and they are still hard and challenging as helli remember playing dig dug on an old computer in my support home work class back in junior high in nyc and today its still a collectors and a classica must buy gem to keep forever for those who love these games and want to play them on the psx
the playstation controller is great with pacman games as well as other games from all the namco museum collectionthanks for readingit got here quick and was in great shape
would purchase from this company again
play great my husband is testing out as we speak thanksmrs packman and dig dug are two of the best video games ever throw pole position in and this is a must have game it is especially fun at partiesnow u can have all of the classic games on ur ps
it has many things to do on it unstead of just playing the original arcade game
what u can do is walk around the museum and look at all of the game rooms or just explore and see what is there
each room that u walk in that is a game has a really cool movie clip before u play them
there is this one room that tells u all of the info about games and when they came out and how popular they were
which is awsome to learn about it
the graphics in the museum r great for the ps but when u play the arcade games they got changed from the original by a tiny bit and the music is more clear
it has many of the classics that u can play single or multiplayer on which is fun
when u get this game dont think all there is is the arcade games in it there is much more than that
it is an awsome gamethis collection of games from namco is a blast from the past for anyone who grew up playing video games at home on atari or who spent their entire life savings at the arcades
the games included on this collection are  ms pac man dig dug galaxion phozon pole position ii and tower of druaga
for those who dont own a ps namco museum vol
 is worth owning because of ms pac man dig dug and galaxionms
pac man is just as fun to play as the original pac man but is just slightly more difficult and gives a more continues the story begun in pac man
dig dug is one of the classic arcade games of the s
the game seems easy enough to play dig your way through dirt kill monsters before they kill you and collect vegetables
however the game becomes increasingly difficult as you progress and before you know it your running away more than you are shooting at monsters because theres just too many of them
galaxion is another arcade classic
it takes the premise of space invaders one step further so that instead of defending a planetary base from destruction and invasion youre in space trying to destroy an enemy fleet before they blow you up
in space invaders you could hide your gun behind turrets but there is no place to hide in galaxion
the other three games on the collection are fairly forgettable and were somewhat obscure in the day
phozon is a type of puzzle game where you try to match up the phozons with the pattern without getting blown to bits
pole position ii is a racing game where you blow up if you get too far off course or run into items
in that sense its realistic
however the game is extremely difficult to play because the analog component of the paddle isnt compatible and you dont have a joystick so youre forced to drive your car using the directional buttons
what a pain
tower of druaga is the final game on the collection
it involves trying to get gil to climb through all the levels of the tower
its kind of like an early video game version of role playing
its kind of interesting but it takes an incredibly long amount of time to defeatoverall this is a great collection for anyone who grew up playing video games in the s
for those who are too young to remember atari the game is nice to play because of its retro and anything retro is cooli love this disc because it gives me the chance to play the old school games that i used to playthis is one of the greatest games of all times
no if ands or buts
this is the granddaddy of them all when it comes to survival horror
yes alone in the dark uninvited and sweet home came first but they went nowhere
this is what kick started an entire genrei love this version of the game the best even more than that remake because it has  options for gameplay original beginner or arranged
arranged is awesome as it arranges the locations of many items in the game
much like the nd quest on the first zelda gamethe voice acting is legendary the graphics just awesome and who can forget the live video at the beginning and ending of the game
the girl who played jill is absolutely beautiful
this game is hard
one bites puts you in orange caution if youre jill on arranged anyway
ammunition is very limited at the start of the game
but thats what makes it so great
you cant run around blasting things
its just wonderfulthere are many easter eggs or little things to find out in this game
look up a good walkthrough if you have trouble finding them
these give the game a good bit of replay valuei highly recommend this if you want a good game
in fact they dont get much betterre is a game that not only the first game that took more than an hourandahalf to beat it was a revolution in video game playing
it was the first in its time
the first game to have actual d characters rather than the suposive d design that doom and duke nukem bragged about their choppy cardboard design
now that the movie of resident evil is out kids and teenagers will be rushing out to buy the re games
for an aparent reason the original re isnt being sold anymore rather that its very very rare and probably costs around  to  dollars
instead theyre is the directors cut
the dc is a odd version of re that most people will be mistaking by the name
no it isnt more gorier and no deleted scenes not included seriously
originally the dc version had a much more explicit graphic beginning with blood and all
but due to censorship and problems with young kids bying mrated games and watching rrated movies the scenes were cut out
the only real different thing about the directors cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots
this will leave already re owners high and dry while satisfying nonre game owners
anyways the storyin re a group of special tactics commandos known as stars
special tactics and rescue squad are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest
the mansion once harvested top secret government experiments lead by a evil corporation known as umbrella
after the first squad bravo team was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication
the second squad alpha team was sent to rescue them
but a few scuffles with unknown creatures leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest
in panic the team finds refuge in the mansion
but little does the team know is that their troubles just begun
you have the choice to either play chris redfield a exmarine turned swat commander or jill valentine a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks
through out the game you must survive in the mansion
your enemies are bioinfested zombiesthats right zombies
the problem youre running low on ammo
the story goes together much like the basis for sam raimis evil dead ii dead by dawn or george romeos night of the living dead
complete with fmv cutscenes that include no less screen actor guild rejected actors with terrible acting and bad dialouge you almost turned into a jillsandwich
 but never the less still a fun game
must buyall i can say about this one is that its just about as good as the other ones just has  dialogue and voice acting and no real cut sceneswe have always been a fan of all the resident evil games we all love to play them and was very happy that the game was in great shape and that we got it fast when we ordered itthe original resident evil changed the game industry forever
although the survival horror genre is certainly old being interplays quotalone in the darkquot the first example to come to my mind re sent the genre and the video game industry where it had never before venturedthe idea simple as it sounds harbors with it the strength to create a fine video game experience lock yourself at a mansion filled with zombies and other creatures plus limited ammo and try to get yourself out of thisthis is the only game of the series that is worth of any praise not only because it did much for the industry but because of its game play valueresident evil  directors cut is a enigma in itself
now why do i say that
well basically this is not a directors cut because capcom messed up
the only people who officially got a directors cut is japan and thier initial release of biohazard resident evil in japan
what we are missing is actually about  seconds in  different videos you see thru the game
in the opening video  seconds is missing which actually makes the video more graphic when joseph dies by one of the zombies dogs and some of the characters are smoking
in the second video where you meet your first zombie you see a more graphic depiction of the zombie eating kenneth
but is it really worth it
most gamers dont even know about it much less care but collectors and true fanatics are really steamed about itthe story is very well done i can say
even though it does not really keep pace within the game it is very interesting and revives a cult classic monsterzombies
vicious murders have plauged the town of racoon city and it is up to the stars special tactics and rescue squad to find out where the source of these murders are coming from
you take on the role as chris redfield or jill valentine and attempt to investigate a house infested with things that go bump in the night
get ready to immerse yourself in the game that started the genre  survival horrorthe gameplay is what to can be expected from a game like this
you will be jumping and many scenes in this game for it will spook the life out of you
i know you are sayingthis is just a gameits more than that trust me
you basically navigate your character throughout the game solving various puzzles to gain access to different areas
you will find plenty of ammo and weapons to help you battle the many monsters you will come up against
other stars member will be around to help you outothers will try to block your way
although the controls are very hard to get used to eventually you can compensate in many situations
you will battle zombies dogs crows and the dreaded masthe hunters
but dont think you wont have the weapons to defend yourself for you will be armed with mm shotguns a colt pyton and a fantastic missle launcherthe graphics are what to be expected for this game
i personally saw no problem with the graphics
many people complain about the camera angles but to me the camera angles added more spook to the game
the hunters still looked scary as heck with the limited graphics
many of the cutscenes are shown within the game engine but the opening and ending actually have real actors
yes the dialouge is cheezy but what do you expectoverall i really enjoyed this game even though it took me a long time to get around to playing it
i still cannot get over how much wesker in the opening movie looks like val kilmer from top gun
it had me jumping in a lot of areas and the puzzles were not too difficult
a great game and a great buyeven with the advent of the ps the original resident evil still holds its water against the modern era of video games
it set the standard for survival horror in video games
it frightens and delights
the controls take a little to get down and the intensity and urgency of the game demand that you get those under control or be eatenthe game takes time and is recommended for those that can devote minhour a day to the gamea must for any game who claims to be a fan of the zombie genremy uncle gave this to me for christmas
i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil  then i knew what this game was
i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it
then i got resident evil  and tried the uncut versionit was ok i started playing it now and then
a month later i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them
and the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticksand instead of gettin only  ink ribbons you get  every time u pick them up
the bad part is that the graphics havent improved
it is also very scary
like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me
still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these go with the uncut onenowadays blowing zombies up is as commonplace as a d fighter that houses a character that can throw a fireball
from the quothouse of the deadquot series to quotsilent hillquot everyone has ripped off  capcoms masterpiece
the story starts off in a city us hardcore gamers  will all know raccoon city
on a hill in an outoftheway area lies a  mansion that holds a deadly secret
down in raccoon city the community has  had violent attacks by zombies that are bumpig off the townspeople
the  rpd
send out their stars
unit to find out whats up with this  mansion and its monsters
both the alpha and omega teams shall never be  the same what you encounter through this tale of death is nothing  short of terror perfetion
from your first encounter with dogs to your  first boss to your return to the mansion only to find your zombie pals  have been replaced with gremlins from hell called hunters this is  horrorgaming nirvana
your characters are jill valentine and chris  redfield
you get to pick which character you lead or lead you down your  path of hell
jill is the easier one to use while chris is the harder one
for example jill starts off with a pistol while chris starts off with the  forever dreaded knife
basically their stories are the same with some  different twists thrown in here and there
for example jills sidekick is  barry while chris gets rebecca
throughout your journey you pick up on  clues as to whats going on
such as diary entries
you come across the  mansion twice a backhouse a garden an underground passage way and an  underground laboratory throughout your story
all the while you hear the  name of a corporation one that will haunt you throughout the series known  as umbrella
the game isnt hard but it isnt easy either
worrying about  ammo and herbs is always the number one priority
playing through the game  to see whats ahead you know horse around then go out for real and work  your way through the story is the biggest tip i can give
and always save  just dont over do the ink ribbons theres only so many
the graphics  were breathtaking then and still hold up today
the control is difficult  for some to get used to but i never had a problem with it
the sound is  also amazing but quite important
usually when i play games i put on my  headphones nine inch nails for me and play away
unfortunately i cant  do this
you need the sound to hear whats going on whether its zombies  that are lurking around a corner you cant see or something following you  you have to listen
this adds to the gaming element immensely
itll often  scare you but thats the point adding a new gaming dimension
one of  fear
my only problem with the game is the story of who originally owned  the mansion
 ultimately capcom scratched all that
and it detracts from it all as the story behind the mansion has too many  holes
in the end though this was a classic video game
not the best  resident evil but mandatory if you intend to play them all as the story is  missing a lot if you pick up on the series when its already told so much
its graphic its bloody its epic its scary and its an experience you  wont soon forget
just dont play with the lights off youll never sleep  againresident evil the survival horror series that that has became so popular and spawned many sequelsgameplay its a survival horror game
in a mansion filled with zombies limited ammo and saves spots limited healing and puzzles
whats there not to like
you can even blow zombies heads off with a shotgun
you can pick two players jill valentine and chris redfield
both are different and you should play as jill first than chrisyou also get three difficulty levels in the dc version easy normal and arrange
arrange is hard with new costumes puzzles and camera anglesgraphics    pretty bad by todays standards but back then it was great and the fmvs have real people in itmusicsound horrorlike music and soundsdialogue very corny
from weskers stay alert and dont open that door
 to barrys i hope this is not chriss blood
 the dialogue and tone is cheesey
but it was made by japanese actors so its easy to understand whyoverall its a must have
get the other re games toothis was the first re game i ever played and it got me hooked on the re series
after playing this i got all the other re games asap 
this is a great game the graphics are good for a ps game and i really liked the action the puzzles and the plot
this is an essential for anybody interested in re and the whole zombie deal  buy this game and you will not be let downbryanreosbcglobalnetresident evil is a survival horror video game created by capcom
it was released in japan north america and europe in in the game you play as either chris redfield or jill valentine two stars officers who become trapped in a mansion filled with zombies
you must go through the mansion and find clues weapons and other items in order to proceed
you fight many different types of zombies throughout the game
some of the supporting characters include rebecca chambers barry burton and albert wesker
the game also has different endings depending on what you dothis is a classic survival horror game
its so good and well made
if you love horror movies or other horror games then i totally recommend that you play resident evileven now i still love playing this  year old game on my ps
it opened the door to greater things
the resident evil series is my favorite video game line everthis puts the most recent code veronica x to shame
it has the best story and best scare factor
sure the graphics may lack a little but its the original first of its kind
i recommend playing this game before playing any more re titles so the stories actually make sensethis is the one that started it all folks
this is about mysterious murders in raccoon city involving cannibalism a group of special police officers called stars
go outside the city to find the murderers but when their helicopter with pilot leaves them behind they seek shelter in a large mansion but unknown to them that the mansion is also a death trap with hordes of zombies giant tarantulas monster dogs and mutant creatures waiting for them will they make it out alivea brilliant and highly original game using elements of lucio fulci george romero dario argento horror and science ficiton with clues gore cool monsters puzzles and knowing how to survive which makes this a oneofakind game for every game player
ive became a fan of this since  its the best game ive ever played with the entire series tooforget the fact that this game came out a long time agochris redfield and jill valentine are your two main playable characters accompanied by barry burton albert wesker rebecca chambers brad vickers enrico morini edward dewey forest spyer richard aiken joseph frost and kenneth sullivan most of which will end up dead before the end of the game which isnt revealing much as most people know about this game
one of the main points of the story is the isolation and being alone searching for your fellow teammembers
if theres  of them in all and the main idea of the game is isolation and terror you better believe youll find some dead teammembers along the way
the story is pretty much known around the world
stars alpha team has been sent to investigate stars bravo teams dissapearence in the woods near a mansion that belongs to umbrella
the tvirus tyrant has been let loose and killed the employees turning them into zombies and unleashing other creatures hunters ah
the game itself really isnt that long  once you learn the puzzle solutions you could breeze through it in a few hours for which you may be rewarded
the arrange mode on this directors cut version features different uniforms for jill and chris and some different camera angles and puzzle solutions
items will be switched around to different locations as well
the overall scare factor of this game is pretty nil but you might jump at a few spots
the graphics are dated sure but theyre basic and likeable
you can tell whats going on and still see extra details unlike the remake where the entire game is a pile of details upon the next pile
one of the most famous  aspects of this game is the voice acting and fmv sequences with actual actors if you even want to call them that
the in game voice acting when you actually find a fellow stars member alive is pretty terrible
id like to track these people down and see if they havent been murdered because of it
the fmv sequences are pretty classic also the opening is the same for eather game and the endings are different depending on who you save during your adventure as chris or jill
final note  i highly recommend this game the directors cut version since it has  games total even if it is extremely old to anyone
the explicit scenes of blah blah at the beginning of the load dont really make a difference as its all squares anyway but this game is actually really fun to play through
i think anyone who has moderate video gaming experience should play this
you might have to get used to the controls but they dont really bother methe original resident evil is the purest example of a survival horror video game
the newer re iterations while fun in their own right are not survival and some would say not even horror video gamesresident evil throws the player into an old dilapidated mansion with the vaguest notion of zombies on the prowl
the original party is split up to investigate the area and the player is left to find clues towards a path to safetyunlike many games supposedly within the survival horror genre resident evil hits the nail on the head with the notions of staying safe
enemies are best avoided as direct combat can result in being quickly overcome with zombies or being poisoneditems are hidden throughout the mansion that detail just how the monstrous zombie outbreak started and to a lesser extent details the lives of the individuals who lived there during the initial stages of the outbreak
there are pictures of their families and friends their clothes tucked into their closets and on occasion the zombified individual himself trapped and desolate in a bathtub or a wing of his homeplaying the game one truly gets a sense of being stranded
in essence it puts the player in the perspective of every human being there during the outbreak
you never know who or what has been turned nor where those beings now dwell
caution is the only priority and this game capitalizes on thatweapons are not found sitting out for any person to find
the player must actively search for items to aid in his or her quest
guns are definitely there but they would be about as wellhidden as a person living inside the mansion would have them
the control scheme may seem archaic now but for the genre the controls are spot on
maneuvering through a hallway full of zombies should not be an easy task and given the options presented it really isntpuzzles are a central albeit quizzical part of resident evils gameplay
in keeping with the survival elements some doors are locked to pass through them the player must find the key
this involves searching roomtoroom around the mansion and solving the occasional puzzle
these elements are definitely wellaligned with the gameplay but from a strictly survival perspective some puzzles fit the scheme better than othersthe plot is weaved strongly through the course of the game
many of your allies are found dead throughout the mission consumed by the horrors of the mansion
others are as desperate as ever to get out while some are a bit too satisfied hanging around
the plot is advanced mostly through cutscenes where characters interact with each other
the voices as all know are pretty hilarious or bad depending on your perspective
for the time characters using voiceovers as opposed to text was revolutionary
unfortunately the voice acting didnt stand the test of time and some of the more hilarious quips are almost insidejokes among video game fansthe graphics were definitely of the era
in  this games graphics would astound any who saw it
twelve years later they are clearly dated
many games of this era cant stand the test of time strangely games of the bit era age more much gracefully and even modern games have become throwbacks to the visuals of that time period but resident evil fares better than many playstation titles
many of the prerendered backgrounds are highly detailed and set the mood wonderfully
given the polygon count of the day its pretty easy to tell where your character stands against the backdrop and conversely where the enemy stands
thankfully the color schemes applied to enemy and ally serve to blend objects and backgrounds together seamlesslythe sound is more forgettable than anything in this game
the soundtrack does serve its duty well in creating and maintaining a frightening atmosphere but theres just not anything noteworthy enough to stick out after over a decade
the sound effects while not fantastic serve their purposes extremely well
given the players mood one would still be prone to jump when a noise is heard offscreenwith a game as old as this one is it would be easy to find faults  especially comparing those faults with currentgen gameplay mechanics and graphics
however if one can allow themselves to enter the early psx era the true beauty of a game like resident evil can shine through
while not perfect this game serves as the ultimate example of what survival horror is
re set the stage for things to come and its great to be able to go back and see the humble beginnings of some of the greatest plot elements and gameplay mechanics we enjoy in video games todayi thoroughly enjoyed this game
it is endless action in this horror survival game but also puzzle solving which makes it and intense and fun game
of course killing zombies never gets old
there are also several versions of the game on this disc so if you want to play it over again you can do so with a slightly different version between the two main characters or the original version or directors cut version
this gives you four optionsresident evil directors cut  the best classic survival game ever
the granddaddy of survival horror
this simple put is the game ever the one that started it all in survival horrorthe bit of acting is a bit cheesey but once you get past that
you  in a mansion full of  zombies muntant dogs lickers
snakes and mutant plants around every corner as you explore the mansion and solve puzzles
it has some scary tone and music in the back ground and if your not fighting  for your life your running from things as you try and solve the mystery of your missing team and the dissapperance of the first team  that you came in search fori highly recommend this game for anyone who loves zombies and into survival horrori got this game at a video store recently and they sell it for only  so i snatched it thinking it was gonna be good
and then it wasgameplay  awesome
youre in a mansion with zombies and lots of monters literally and youve got a lot of weaponsgraphics  the graphics add to the scares
and plus jill has a nice assdialouge  horrible
from weskers  stay alert and get away from him
hes insane
to barrys what is this
amd well lets hope this isnt chriss blood
entertainment value  its awesomeso go buy this todaywhen i first got my playstation   this was the first game i got 
it is and will always be a cool game to play
besides the cheesy voice acting  or so so graphics  it is still a gem of a classic 
why else would capcom redo the first one for gamecube 
as well as do  more games for gamecube  and do a movie on it 
because it is and always will be the coolest zombie game ever and not one you could easily cheat on either  unless you got a gameshark  because using the guide is not cheating 
you still have to beat the game and possess some skill and patience to play it 
resident evil   was great 
and nemesis even better 
and lets not forget  code veronica  either 
hopefully a few new ones will be put out for ps owners as well why should gamecube owners get all the fun 
so i hope you go out and get it 
this is one game you can literally play to death 
if you get a gamecube than get the new and improved  resident evil  
and all the other ones out now  or soon to be out  anyone care for a game of killing zombies tonite this brought back so many memories
the godfather of all games
this is a must have for any avid game collectori played this on my ps shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it
the games graphics use of prerendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience
unfortunately the game hasnt aged well especially the graphics
theyre low resolution and blocky when compared to todays and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience
if youre considering playing this i strongly recommend you consider playing the resident evil remake instead
its far superior to the original in every way possible
if you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but i found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remakei purchased this version on my playstation  this updated version was released a year and a half after the original games release
directors cut was produced to compensate for the delay of the sequel resident evil  and was originally bundled with a playable demo of that gamethe main addition to directors cut is an arranged version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion as well as the enemy placement
the main characters as well as rebecca are given a new wardrobe and the players handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie killing it instantly
the original version of the game is included as well along with a new beginner mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled
additionally the autoaim function was restored in all modes though it is not noted in the ingame controls so the player must accidentally stumble upon iti recommend all re fans to get this versionthe one that started it all i have it and you should to i will in detail say the pros and cons of the gamethe pros are great story great puzzles the suspense is great as well as the monsters that are in it over all it draws you in the world of the resident evilthe cons to much back and forth in the game bazooka wont blow open doors the other issue is if played on the ps you have to get used to the original controls again im used to ps games now guess im spoiled lol where you use the analog sticks to move and look aroundover all great game turn out the lights put it in and put yourself in the game and have funthis is the amazing game that started the genre of quotsurvival horrorquot and created the interest in fans for such games
this game is pretty old now but if you havent played it yet youll surely want to give it a try
the point to this game is simple survive a mansion full of zombies while solving puzzles along the way
what makes this game a challenge is the fact that you have to fend off enimies with a very limited amount of health and life
another challenge is that occasionally enimies will pop out and give you a surprise which you must quickly defend against
another great thing is that on this version of the game you get a special edition of resident evil and a harder difficulty levelhave not played yet but looks all good to me
i will be playing it tonight
a must for those interested in resident evilwhen you ask someone why the sega saturn failed and why the sony playstation succeeded most people knowledgeable on the subject dont have a great reason
the best answer ive come up with is that sony playstation had some smash hits that the saturn did not have
games like tomb raider twisted metal and final fantasy vii were megahits that saturn did not have an answer for
one game came very early into the playstation library and was deemed an instant classic by gamers and critics alike and that game is the first resident evil game the first true hit for the sony playstationreleased by capcom in early  resident evil was unlike any game we had ever seen at the time
with an opening title screen that explodes in blood and symbolizes terror resident evil is a game that truly doesnt reveal itself right away
you have the opening story cinema scenes that vaguely explain your elite police officers reason for venturing out into strange territory in search of your teammates
one of your teammates is killed during the investigation of the crashed helicopter by a strange canine beast of sorts so the actors run for shelter in a spooky looking mansioni wont rehash everything about the game but i believe it is important to try and recapture the feeling of the first time playing the game
its pretty difficult to describe
the music is perfectly eery and sets the tone grandly with stringed arrangements you would hear in a suspenseful terror film
you walk around trying to find clues about what is going on in this strange mansion
bizarre zombie creatures roam around desperately seeking to sink their teeth into your fresh blood you try and find better guns to deal with these creatures and you also try and find the keys to unlock the doors without knowing what terror lurks on the other side
on top of that the seemingly haunted mansion has traps and strange puzzles that must be solved in order to continue finding your way closer to the end of the game almost like a spooky mansion in a murder mystery
horribly mutated dogs crash through windows when you least expect it and the ammunition in the game is in a very limited supply so you are forced to make snap decisions whether to stand and fight or run for safety
scattered throughout the game are personal correspondence diaries and logs that reading will give you a clue to the ultimate mystery surrounding what the hell is going onbefore this game the story regarding umbrella didnt exist
ironically this kind of makes the game more mysterious
in other games we already know about the umbrella corporations role in the story so this game is a unique experience of unraveling the truth
on top of that this game takes place in the spencer estate mansion which is the perfect terrifying setting for this unique gaming experience
theres nothing wrong with the second and third games taking place in a precinct but a haunted mansion crawling with the undead is just perfectchris and jill are the playable characters both with their strengths and weaknesses
honestly jills game is much easier
she gets the bazooka which chris does not and is given the lockpick at the start of the game in place of having to find the sword key
jill also has  inventory slots to chris paltry six and because chris has no lockpick he has to find small keys to open the locked drawers for ammunition
having a small key clogging one of chris six inventory slots is quite a nuissance especially since jill does not even have to bother wasting one of her eight inventory slots with the lockpick
finally the obvious reason for jills easier game is in her companion barry burton
barry is very helpful and will heal jill from a giant poisonous snake give her acid rounds for the bazooka help her to get the shotgun and will even torch the massive plant  for her while chris is forced to rely on the inexperienced rebecca to learn to play piano find serum for him and mix up a potion to injure plant  there are ways to alter rebeccas actions to make her a bit more useful but in the end her assistance is not as valuable as barrystoday the polygon graphics that were so compelling during this age of gaming do look substantially dated and the voice acting which was considered atrocious even when the game was new is laughably absurd
but who couldnt use a laugh after the horrors and suspense of playing this gamewe all know the storyline of the game and most of us remember all the thrilling moments to the point where they have lost their sharpness over the years
but take yourself back in time for a minute and try to remember what this game felt like to you the very first time you played it when you were much younger and games were much different
this game felt like nothing we had ever played and no gaming experience was even close to what we got from the playing the original resident evil
back then there was still alot of social debate whenever a game came around that featured a significant amount of violence yet resident evil was so unique in that it literally felt like being trapped in a scary zombie movie
there wasnt much debate surrounding the gratuitous amount of gore like there was with other games mortal kombat and instead gamers and critics were unified in their praise of the games excellent and unique gameplay and experiencegamecube would later revamp the game with updated graphics better voice acting and many new thrilling surprises but you just cant beat that feeling you got when you first popped in this game not knowing what to expect
this game has one of the greatest legacies and is every bit deserving of all the accolades accumulated sincewow first off i have to say pure classic
i love this game in all of its dated graphics and game play with additional cheesy jill sandwich dialoge glory
that is what this baby is glory
a truly excellent game with excellent graphics for its time and its for this nerd at least one of the fondest memories of my wasted childhood i have
in fact this is one of the things i spend countless hours mastering that i dont regret one bitthe control is simple and responsive which i like
this game to me was my first introduction to actual video games sure id play mario or primal rage or what ever on the old snes
then one fatefull day young kazuki ferret was at age  introduced to resident evil
the game for him challenging puzzles which tested intellect well designed levels and characters and o course gunslooking back now this game was an excellent first for the giant we know today as the resident evil series
with such classic games as re re code veronica and re stemming from it
this game is a simple must own in your video game collection if you see a copy and dont own one buy it is what i say
i got the copy i have for  which is an excellent price for such a classic game
there is no reason not to own this gamekazuki ferret the angry resident evil nerdthe story tells that people were strangely disappearing in the arklay mountains northwest raccoon city
half of the stars a police group whos always hired when things go really bad goes in to investigate but they dont come back
thats when the rest of the group come to arklay mountains to see whats happening to those missing people and to the missing part of the team they would just wish they were never bornresident evil is a classic video game series
unfortunately the first movie wasnt nearly as good as any of the main games from the series
the graphics might not be great since most of us own nextgen consoles like ps xbox and gcn but theyre still decentthe soundtrack is amazing voice acting is a little weird and a little silly but its ok videogames arent about how close to reality it looks and feels
if it was games from the past would be forgotten very quickly
what makes horror games special is how fun and scary they are and this along with silent hill is the best horror game youll ever playsoul blade is the very first game in the soul caliber series
i guess it was soul blade in the arcade and became soul caliber years later for the dreamcast and they decided just to go with that from then on
its quite a classic in my opinion
thats actually why i bought it because to be honest the game play has aged a bit and there are much tighter fighting games out there now
its still a great game to have though
aside from being the arcade game there is also a weapons master mode in which you select a character and play out a story where you travel the land acquiring new weapons in search of the legendary soul blade
if you were into arcade fighting games in the s then you should probably have thisok this game is pretty much all ps owners have of soul caliber since it went to dreamcast
my friends still come over so we can all play it on my ps
this game is tightespecially for a ps game i just hope soul caliber  is made for the ps
for the price this game goes for its worth it completly
i traded granturismopsgame for itwhen d fighters first entered with virtua fighter i was not impressed
add to that the dismal nature of the star wars fighter and things did not look promising
but thanks to games such as this and tekken the fighting genre was saved
i first played this game in the arcade and was floored
gone were the glitching side to side movements
in were smooth animations with amazingly real movement
it translated as close to flawlessly as possible to the playstationfrom the opening sequence to the finale i was hooked
the graphics are amazing
the characters are very well rendered and rather well balanced
you have your constent movement fast players as well as the guard forever and kill in one blow slow guy along with many consistent characters
my favorite character is taki but thats probably because she reminds me of chung ligame control is excellent
combos rely less on stick movement than on button combinations which makes it much easier for beginners to pick up
throws are actually a challenge to execute but are worth the work
the backgrounds are truly amazing and the soundtrack is something else
the tracks are very deep with what seems like full orchestrationof course the greatest fun is playing against other people but the single player formats available are quite good
the edge master mode is somewhat rpglike in nature and is a nice addition
my favorite mode is the team battle where your  take on the opponents for the price you absolutely cannot beat this title
the gameplay is great and the controls are rather intuitive
give the bonus of amazing graphics and sound if you like fighting games youll love this onehow can you go wrong with the game that started it all
i love playing this and i love watching the animations from the characters that are still identical to the ones used on later soul calibur games
they didnt change some of them
its pretty neati remember playing this game when i was younger
i like this original soul blade game more because the character hwang
he wielded a chinese two handed straight sword
the disc was in perfect condition
very good classic gamelike play game as fun and enjoy
havent play for long time and final get so like play what i can say that alltwisted metal  is one of the best twisted metal games i still like black better
i liked the movie where axel goes back to his father and rips his arms out of his machine
i hate the t rating
buy this game nowtwisted metal  was a huge game back in the day
the graphics were really good for its time and the play control while some will probably argue with me was always accurate and responsive
this is truly a classic game
it had many imitators that hardly anyone remembers these days
stick with the twisted metal series though
you cant go wrong with the amount of destruction this game has to offerwhen i got this game i was thrown back to the days i went to my uncles house just to play this game with him
its fun and its cool that they use real locations for the battle because you get to blow things up and find secret path ways and weapons to defeat your enemies
i have most of all the tm games and i cant wait to have them all even the games that where made from different game company
because the game play over all is the samethis game is awesome it is better then black except for the graphics sound and story
but gameplaywise this game excelsinnocent pedestrians secret goodies destorying the eiphel tower while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to your advantage
on single player this game is kinda tedious but on p hello fun
i had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house
we beat the game several times but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruledif this game had sound and graphics and some better storyline this would be in the top  games of all timealso twisted metal  and  was not good get tw or tw black insteadnow this one was way more fun than tm
what was fun was the endings etc where it would show the little video clips
liked seein them they were crazy
this game was fun though for sure to play with friends and allbeing a long time twisted metal fan this game would have to be my favorite in the series
amazing soundtrack great level design unique characters and an overall fun experience especially with friends
i highly recommend this to any fan of action gamesi rented this game because i am a big tm fan
ill tell ya this game is pretty old and doesnt have the best graphics but its awesome
the levels are cool
my favorite is holland field of screams
the characters are awesome too
my favorite is minion
one of the things that i almost immediately noticed about this game was the machine guns
i dont even know why they give you machine guns on tm  and  they dont do anything
on tm  the machine guns actually do some damage and debris flies off other vehicles when they are hit
it would take a week to kill someone with your machine guns on tm  and  actually you would be killed in less than a minute if all you use is a machine gun on tm  and  if you want a good vehicular destruction game you can buy any tm game they are all fun but i recommend tm  it will provide hours of fun especially deathmatch modeintroductionwhen i bought my playstation i had now clue of any twisted metal games until i played this one
i never was able to get my hands on the first one but this one is amazingthe gametwisted metal is a car compitition almost like demolition derby except with crazy characters and weapons
many games have tried to copy this gameplay but none could ever create one like this
the competition is held by calypso and he gets people in search of help to join his competition and if they win through the  levels of demolition they get one wish from him
calypso is all in this for entertainment while the characters are in it for something importantthe goodthis game is one of a kind and has many good points
first of all is the gameplay
it is replayable and you can chose from any vehiclecharacter and take him through the end of the game and see his ending story
all of the characters are unique in an individual way and they each have their own special to terminate enemies
there are plenty of weapons to pick up and fire at opponents like the homing missile and fire missile and napalm
the levels are well designed and there are eight of them to battle through
the coop mode makes the game especially fun but takes away the story aspect at the end
also each vehicle makes their own sound when using there specialthe badthe graphics can be a little bit choppy at times and many of the obsticals are flat
some of the story lines are not worth playing through the whole game you just have to be careful who you pickconclusionoverall the game is excellent and is a must buy even if our deciding to buy it now and you have a psthis was the first game i ever played with interavtive environments it was really cool to blow the eifel tower up or make ice sheats fall with your opponet on them this game was awesome and i still play it even though i have a pstwisted metal  is the best playstation game ever
the levels are fun because they are so different from one another
each level provides interactive fun
the cars are great and the specials weapons are excellent
the ending movies like the tital suggests are twisted
i do not find this game offensive in any way and i think it good for responsible kids ages  and up
everyone should buy this game
it is the best of the four twisted metal games
you will love itthe twisted metal games in my opinion have seen their day since this gem was released
i have spent many hours playing this game either by myself or with friends
this game is a lot of fun with a lot of replay value
the game boasts good graphics and sound
i would recommend this game to anyone that is into vehicular combat fighting games and competitive funeven though it came out a little over six years ago twisted metal  still stands as one of pss best games and the best twisted metal game in the entire series
the graphics are a bit dated by todays standards but everything else still holds up
the environments are huge and fully interactive you can blow up the eiffel tower in paris and destroy he gown around the statue of liberty to reveal a bikini in new york and the control was at its peak here in all of the twisted metal games
without a doubt a playstation classic this deserves to be in every ps or ps players librarytwisted metal two is by far the best twisted metal game in the series
the levels are awesome the weapons are awesome the characters are really awesome
so many memories came back to me while playing this game and it is still a very fun game to play
the controls take some getting use to since the game is over  years old but other then that the game has held up well over the yearsthe title says it all better than the first and third
tm black was good but ultimately it will take a lot to revive the seriesa real classic
it works
no problems
i love it and will always keep this game
i recommend it to anyonewell heres the lowdown the twisted fighting plot and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series twisted metal
tm brings you back into the twisted metal competition
but this time its a one way trip round the world
battle in la to hong kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you
tm introduces a few new characters into the fray twister grasshopper shadow axel and mr slam
duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm remote detonator and the ricochet bomb
beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with calypso the twisted creator of the twisted metal competition and have your wishes fullfilledbottom line an awesome sequel to an already awesome gamewith this racing game you actually race across the country from state to state
some of the vehicles that you can drive are a bus cop cars there are two different color cop cars both different top speeds an old roadster and lots more
there are at least  maps to choose from
enjoyi thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the n so so early of a release
this is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and i was suprised to find such a fun gamehowever the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards
the records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system im not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucksstill like i said earlier this is an early title for the n you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is
buy it if your into race games ignore it if your looking for the bestthis is one of the funnest most addictive game ive ever play
you start out with  cars a type i dont remember a lexus a racecar and using the cheat a jeep bus and police carat the beginning a bikini babe waves the flag and you cruise down famous landmarks like san fransisco or grand canyon etc
its highspeed action from there
you can turn traffic on or off and you can crash into cars hard but you always keep on goingrafx  this is primitive nsound  the soundtrack is the bestgameplay fun  its the bomboverall overall this is one of the best games evernote this review is going to be short since there isnt really much to say about the gamecruisn usa isnt actually as bad the averaged out amazon rating says
theres some good arcadestyle racing here
you may not be interested in this category if you like games like mario kart but its still a pretty good game
granted there are some pretty cheesy things that have been said ingame wow so this is the grand canyon
 but you can get used to that easilyanother thing that some may complain about is that the game is short
you can beat the game in a little less than a half hour
but i dont care about how long a game is
it just needs to fit with its priceand boy do you have a chance of buying a used copy for a few bucksthe game is like rad racer on the nes but  times better
if you like games that are similar to rad racer ridge racer or maybe need for speed then cruisn usa is definitely something to buydo you remember sitting behind the steering wheel at the arcade and playing this game
i know i do
brings back a lot of memoriesthis is fun i think it is a little less fun the next one crusin world because the game playthrough always follows the exact same path and the tracks are all fairly boringa fun game to battle against your friends
up to  players can play at a time
this is one fun game to havestarfox was one of the premiere games for the super nintendo boasting some of the best graphics that any platform of the time could show off and yes the game at the time did deliever in what could be described in a quottour de forcequot performace
when the game transitioned making its way onto the nintendo  i had to hail the calling of this game and buy it so i did
the result
i was as happy as any person could have been after spending the money for this game and it was worth it
the game is easy to beat but only on the easy route
there are hundreds of ways that give this game a replay value that could be unmatched at the time such as getting medals for every planet in the quotgalaxyquot in order to unlock expert mode or the ability to win tanks in multiplayer mode or even be able to fight on foot
so is this game worth the money you would pay for it now
yes give this game a home on your shelf
enjoytheres a strong case for this title being ns most replayable with a heart rivaled only by zelda
the arcade and scorebased gameplay alone means competitive revisits and you can absorb a complete experience in a reasonable timeframe like a good tv show
even with the kid friendly premise there is a sense of true emotion between the characters
you care about fox his team and the strife they encounter
most of all this game has yet to be topped for its kind  the closest they got was the ds remake but even that isnt a whole new game plus the voices were way better in this onethis game is fairly short and can be beaten in a matter of ten minutes on the easy route but it does provide other secrets and ways to go about the game
you can go through three main paths but you can quirk the paths if you decide to or if you screw up on one part of the level
you definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score
the rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title
the voices are also a nice added feature
buy this game guysgameplay you play fox mccloud a fighter pilot for starfox and youre at war with the forces of the evil andross
its more or less a rail shooter but theres some freeroaming flight to be had at various points through the game
one of the best features of starfox is that progression is nonlinear
your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game
for instance if you defuse the bomb on one level you go one route
if you fail you end up playing a different levelgraphics you have to be a little forgiving of starfox in this area
its a fairly early n game
in the grand scheme of n graphical quality starfox  is probably somewhere near the bottom
but if youre turning down the new ds starfox in favor of the old school one released fifteen years ago chances are you wont care about thatsound the music is pretty good as is the voiceacting
although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later n games with voiceacting starfox  still has one of the best uses of voiceacting on the system
flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in handtheres still a lot of fun to be had with starfox even after all this time
i rented it and progressed most of the ways you could progress back in the day and im glad to own it for the system nowthere is no save feature but the whole campaign takes a hour at most
just sick with some friends and do a barrel roll skippystar fox  known as lylat wars in europe is a shooting game for the nintendo  you play as fox mccloud and he must go on an adventure through space to find and destroy andross
throughout the game peppy slippy and falco help youthis game is really fun and addictive
it is also really short and a little challenging in some parts
but when you learn the gameplay it becomes really easy
this is a really fun gamethe cartridge was clean game worked well
i bought in the game in hopes itd be fun but its not all great not the sellers fault though so  starswas glad to find it
it works great
still playing it
i was hoping i would get as much enjoyment out of it as when i was younger and i do
great replay valuehow could you not love this game the animals talk
there are so many great lines from this game that i dont really care about anythingelse except being able to hear dont party just yet time to try our new weapon
i just love this game it can be as hard as you want it to be so stop saying its easy
anyways this game was put out  years ago and still every once and a while i decide to play this and i love it cuase it has the talking animals on it
im going to repeat this talking animals
slippy gets on my nerves though i just kill him becuase he always gets some guy on his ass and keeps bleating get this guy off my fox
i wanna crack his skull everytime he says that it pisses me off
then theres that stupid chick that knows falco the bad ass of course and she is annoying i wish i could kill her becuase when you go to the z zone she steals your kills so you cant get the freaking medal i hate her
it is so annoying that she steals your kills
oh that has to be the worst part of the game its woefully madening
also to not are the apes who try to kill you though they make the noble animal of the ape villanious they still have memoriable lines like andross ive failed you
then there is team wolf they are tottaly bad
they are pretty hard to kill on the other side of venom but like i said if you got the skills you may one day beat them and you say this game is too easy
oh my gosh
anyways i do like the bunny guy whats his name
i forgot but hes like your the best slippy
and that makes me want to cry becuase they are always so hard on slippy
i love it that they actually give him love in aquos cuase ive heard the stories poor slippy
anyways fox is a stud of course damn he is looking good
he works hard of course cuase im controlling him
anyways the best characters are the bosses cuase they say stuff to you thats funny like that one boss admits defeat but then comes back after you cuase he was lying what did you think youd get off that easy
heck no
anyways i hope you love this game as much as i do becuase i say those lines everyday before i go to sleep cause it bring hope
especially when the bunny guy affectionatly tells fox your becoming more like your father
foxs father was a pimp too
thats the ultimate compliment in the lylat system
im sure fox shed a tear when he heard that from his bunny partner
im out only a loser doesnt like this game cuase he is a nerd with no sense of humor who wants to play a real flight simulator
yeahstar fox  is one of the most fun games ive ever played
it was one of the first n games to utilize the rumble pak it was also one of the first to include voices for all the characters
the premise of the game is simple you as star fox are trying to save the solar system from the evil andross
to do this you hop in your space ship and blow tons of enemy crafts to bits
the game is simple but fun and can be replayed over and over
ive played through star fox  more times than any other game ive ever ownedthe goodthe gameplay is fast paced simple and fun
action packed there is never a dull momentthe controls are tight and are perfectthe level design is excellentthe force feedback through the rumble pak makes the game feel more intensethe replay value is through the roof there are many different ways to get to the final bossall characters have voiceslots of secretsthe badthe quotmultiplayerquot game is really really bad
its so bad that it is not worth playing
but thats what goldeneye is for rightthe graphics by todays standards are outdatedsome of the voices are pretty annoying slippy in paticularthis game is nothing short of a masterpiece
i still play starfox  today and its just as much fun as when i got it  years ago
everything seems perfectly tweaked and just right
a game for the agesfiner words have never been spoken
starfox  was the long awaited american sequel to the original starfox for the snes japan got starfox  on snes while us americans had to wait for starfox 
excellent game superb d graphics and for the love of michael douglas play with the rumble packpeople played this in the store for days on end even though most could not afford it for the n
star fox was an amazing blast em up for the n that was visually stunning to watcheven a decade down the line this is a great game
the original star fox on snes used a groundbreaking chip to create rudimentary d graphics
the n version took that and essentially upgraded it giving the graphics an overhaul and tossing in a few new gameplay enhancements
this was one of the first games on the n to feature large amounts of speech and also the first to use the rumble pakyou are fox mccloud leader of the star fox mercenary team
you blast through levels shooting up everything in sight and blowing up massive bosses
the game uses a branching system where out of the  possible levels you will explore a total of  in any given playthrough
so each playthrough is short but there is replay value in going back and unlocking the alternate paths
and the action is so fast and intense that youll be coming back multiple times anywaythere was never really a star fox game for gamecube to top this one so star fox  still remains a favourite
proof that great gameplay can outlast aging graphics
a mustown for any n collectionstar fox on the snes not the best space shooter
star fox on the nintendo 
nd best game on that system the first is ocarina of time
every level was packed with thrilling action
on the first level i enjoyed an easy ride along corneria gliding across the lakes listening to peppy complain
the nd level meteo really picked up the pace and the drama was incredible for the nintendo  the level opens with peppy saying its quiet
too quiet
 quickly followed by look out it is a trap
 followed by a hoard of enemies then giant meteors ending with the most disturbing thing ive ever seen in a video game
a giant space craft swoops down and a monkey with a british accent says i can not allow you to go any further
after a short time the british monkey says i am no match for you
i admit defeat
the whole game goes silent and then the monkey yells if this does not work
he fires a huge amount of lasers and then calls me scum after i defeat him
time for level 
this one was also disturbing but provided the greatest thrill i had ever had
the star wolf team comes in saying some very creepy comments while they beat me
youll be with your dad soon fox
foxs dad is dead im going to bust you up reaaalll good
says the pig who betrayed foxs dad and go back to the pond froggy
then right in the middle of that big fight the robot assistant comes in and says danger
a bomb has been discovered in the base
explosion in  minute
level  was at the climax of wierdness though
a giant terminatorlike robot came in and started repeating destroy
destroy
i have not been able to get level  the robot always crushes me and then i get game over
i do highly this game though
it is possibly the most thrilling game on the n
trust me it is addictingmario party is the kind of game that became an instant classic
play it once and your hooked
if you grab three friends and play there is no better feeling in the world
play what seems like endless minigames with either mario luigi princess toadstool aka
peach wario dk and my personel favorite yoshi
believe me this is a good deal for such a good gameyeah
so the story is very weak
things are often like that for multiplayercentered games
at least mario party had actually tried to spice things up with a story
wheres the story for super smash bros
wheres the story for mario kart 
i didnt think so
as weak as the mario party story is the story isnt important for a gamethe gameplay is
some games with great stories have fallen flat because of poor gameplay
other games with no story succeed with great gameplay
mario party is definitely in the latter category
you can hate the mario party series for its excellent land before time impression
you can be among the groups of people that prefer mario party  and mario party  yet there is one thing that you must admit
mario party was darned fun back in 
sure people said to never play with one person but playing all four characters as one person can be a blast as wellanticipation may have been the first boardgame video game for nintendo but it wasnt exactly successful and had relatively primative gameplay
so people now associate mario party with the introduction of boardgame video game and its definitely more like a board game than any other game before it
i mean you roll a dice and move around the board encountering various pitfalls and experiencing different events
although most of the boards are welldesigned i have realized that the majority of the boardgame aspect is text or movement and somebody watching a tape with only footage the boardgame aspect would likely get very bored very fast
but what makes mario party the gem that it is arethe minigames
yes mario party has  mini games to entertain all souls from all walks of life
sure not all minigames are perfect but you know what
even with all of the blisters broken glasses and white powder appearing on the n controller the minigames are still worth it
especially mushroom mixup and running of the bulb
oh yeah
those are great games
mushroom mixup provided tons of frantic fun and running of the bulb was hectic but exciting
player teamwork games really need to make a comebackbeing a title developed by a third party yes hudson is a rd party developer the graphics in mario party are not exactly polished
most of the textures are just simple polygons
and as was stated the water is in the bombs away game is extremely pixelated
these graphics are not the ones that are so grand that you cant help but go uah but why bother with visual aesthetics when the game is already filled with gameplay finesse
at least the graphics dont hurt your eyes
i cant say that about a game that game out  months after mario partyim sure you all know what it is
sound
sound effects are amusing but not exactly something special
voice acting is good but i finally found out after five years that much of the voice samples were lifted directly from the japanese version of mario kart  the music
it is fantastic
theres a hint of super mario bros mixed in with the rest
its great to listen to even if it is all just midis
okay a lot of this is probably due to nostalgia
i can write a paper on nostalgia and mario party but ill leave it at this
the bottom line is even though mario party isnt one of the technologically advanced games on the n it sure makes up for it with its incredible gameplayyou either love mario party or hate it i always wanted it as a kid and i finally bought it
great to play with my college friendsi still remember the first time i played this game it remains a favorite even today
some minigames are a bit simple but i still love itony complaint paddle battle
whos stupid idea was this
rotating the controlstick gives me blisters
ouchmario party is a fun board game video game where you are on a game board trying to earn stars
you hit blocks to determine the number of spaces you  move and earn or lose things depending on the space you land on
then at  the end of each turn you play a mini game
there are other fun things to  do like play in the minigame stadium shop for new games and play  individually to earn prizes
however one major downer
the rotating hand  games
play this game enough and games like quotcast awaysquot the one  with the light bulb and the  vs  riverboat game will cause blisters in  your handif you like this one then check out the nd one as well for  more options new board games and minigames as well as new gameplay  features
however some mini games and boardgames in this version are  really great so give em both a gothis is a awesome game its fun and chalaging
its fun for the whole familythe cart is functional and came as pictured
this is a great game for inciting fist fights and destroying friendships of all ages
would recommend to anyone looking to end an unsavory relationshipthe original mario party is a must as previous mentioned in the title for any retro gamer and collector of classics
those of you who have played mario party  or  for the wii can now see the humble beginnings of this popular series of hit family gamesunlike mario party  there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the mushroom kingdom mario luigi peach yoshi dk and wario are arguing over who could be the super star
after a rather amusing argument sequence the six are placated by toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the super starwhen held in comparison of the boards of mario party  and  for the wii the boards of mario party  are still holding up well
naturally the graphics are incredibly dated but the design is a tad more intricate and focuses on gameplay instead of the visual style
the rules are the same for each board also you and three other players move around the board in a predetermined amount of turns play addictive and fun minigames collect coins and hopefully a star or two try not to run into bowser who will cause nothing more but trouble and steal your money or stars and after each amount of turns play out you get a cool little cinema of victory if you winwhile i consider mario party  visually better and more entertaining this game is still a classic and not just because it started the mario party craze
i love this game because the music is very cool compared to the strange pieces played in  and the controls are much more easier to use than the erratic unpredictability of the wiiremotes
all in all a solid purchasei got this game in excellent condition in june of  but i have loved it since it came out in america on february   i recommend buying it without ever renting it
there are a couple of minigames that are not good for your controller and can blister your hand
they involve spinning the control stick
and you have to do so vigorously otherwise youll lose
i have all eight games
im nealy  years old and i love mario partypresentationback in the day nintendo wanted another fun multiplayer game to create that doesnt exactly involve racing and thus the first of many mario party games was created
lets see how they did in this new evolution to one of the most influential franchises in gaminggameplaythis was one of the first nintendo games to include  player multiplayer and boy did people love this
basically this game is like a board game you start off with  coins and you roll a dice to determine where you go depending on the spaces you land on you can have fortunate things happen to you unfortunate things or you can end up gaining or losing coins
at the end of each turn the  players compete in a minigame where the winner has a chance to win  coins
you want coins so you can have enough to buy a star from toad or maybe even have boo steal one for you
when youve made a whole lap around the board depending on the time of the game koopa troopa will give you neither  or  coins
after  turns when the game ends youhave a chance to win bonus stars the person with the most stars after that wins
the gameplay is a lot of fun whether you are playing alone or with friends
music and sound effectsthe music is very catchy to listen to and the sound effects are good for the most part
the voice acting however is hilarious nothing like hearing wario yell doh
i missed
storythe story is for the most part an amateur story
however most mario games are mario and his friends one day argue about who is the best and they decide to find out who is through multiple games of mario party
in the meantime bowser trys to cause trouble for the characters and they end up eventually defeating him at his volcano
angered by this he tries to defeat them again in space luring them there by stealing their stars
they once again defeat bowser and the winner of that game is declared the superstar
the default winner of the game is wario
overallmario party is a great single player and multiplayer game
and can be enjoyed by anyone of any age though the game is out of date i find this to be one of the best of the mario party series
with this i give this game an overall score of this game is so much fun
this is where it all started this game is one of the best mario parties
theres  characters who are arguably to this day still the most popular mario characters
theres  minigames and  fantastic boardsi had a n back then in  so i got this game
it is greatgameplaywow
great gameplay
theres awesome characters donkey kong peach etc
and the game is like a little electronic gameboard
with a dice and spaces lots that you can trustminigames great minigames
theres shyguy says a game where your supposed to press whatever button he tells you
and a game which you can make a treasure chest come to yougraphics pretty good for an n game the only other n game that had grat graphics was perfect darksound great
pretty great for an old gameoverall grade aso if you have an n then get this gamemiss play game for long time i havent play so now final get and play as enjoy
alright thumb upthere were so many cool hidden things in this game and strange little things that you could do beyond just racing
the glitch were when you were driving towards the center of the destruction derby and hit it just right and go shooting into the air is my favorite
this always used to make my day as a kidi remember renting this back in the day when playstation was still in its infancy
i really like this game and i still play it todayplayed this game years ago and owned it too but it got lost over the years lol
well now i have it agian and wow brings back memories  the gameplay is simple u race u wreck and when all else fails u go backward and smash anything that moves
there is not a game like this currently
there have been some sequals but they are not like this and a new game like this would be awesomethis game brought me hours of fun i dont know what everyones problem isthis game is very challenging and requires some brains which is why i like it better than those other gun games
even though i was losing i was hooked to it and i didnt scream or curse the game either
so if you like those type of mindchallenging games i recoomend this one
the only bad thing about it is the guns you can run out of ammo fast but i gave the game  stars anywayi enjoy watching tom cruise do some interesting things in some of the strangest places
walk around the hotels and things
it is much better than james bond
it doesnt have all of the gun sounds droning around

what with the shield generaters and alla great game with lots and lots of diversityyou cant get boredtime hero preventing alien harvests
different time lines  different vehiclesi find this game was very well thought out
the harvesting wall alone adds very much to the story
a shield boundary that you cant pass
as you progress through the game you get newer weapons and vehicles of that time period
its rewarding when you stumble across a tank and then in turn wreak havoc on all aliens that you come to
planesboatsbikes firetrucks you name it this game has that vehiclethis game sounds great also
you can hear the rifle reverb all vechicles sound different and it has very interesting mood musicthis game is very interactive which is why i like it so much
as you beat bosses and levels you can wrap back any time you want
a simple touch is that you can turn on or off all candleslanternstorches and  lights in the buildings
you have to pull switches block windmills and at one point use a fire truck to put out a fireripping through the jungle in your jeep ohhh sheeet
to fast
you ditch it into a pond
there is one less jeep you can drivethis game is an orginal game idea that always earns bonus points
and it was done very wellto sum it up
i like the levels all the vechiles the graphics of mutalating a alien with a maching gun on the tank
the puzzles aspect
its greatsome people are just a little to tough on this game
it reminds me of starship troopers so mucha very worthy classic
 i always wondered why i could never beat this game and as a  year old adult i figured it outthis game is hard
i will not post any spoilers but this game has done an awesome job with the technology available at the time of its creation and gta takes homage to it and based gameplay similarities off it
anyway there are not many games in todays day that makes games like this
it creates the atmosphere that you are under an imminent threat and you are never alone but at the same time its only you that lies between a saved planet and destruction
if you havent played this game but want to play older games i would highly recommend this
if you are like me and havent beaten this gamegive yourself that satisfaction and do itbody harvest is like nothing you have played before
the idea is much like blast corps n and you actually harvest bodies in this game
the stages on each level where quite big and hard to complete
it is highly unique and addictive
anyway this was the leading n i played in the winter of  by at which stage we where hearing that the old  playstation  was about to undergo a change
there was an important reason why i gave up buying more games on the n after the winter of  or the whole of  i had been playing the n since the end of  start of  i got two solid great gaming years out of it with the following two years spent playing the mutliplayer n we loved and ownedit would another few years before i would pick up a games console againmy husband loved his birthday gift he played this when he was younger and due to a bad divorce from his ex wife he lost it
now he has it back and we are building a collection together
he was impressed what i paid for it and how great of a condition it was in when it arrived
perfect condition perfect working order
would buy from this seller againwhere do i begin
the graphics are topnotch for the time it was released and the environments vary from being colorful to plain dark with a very fitting soundtrack that hums perfectly with its perspective locations and the controls are pretty solid and you can even use the analog stick which is pretty neat for a game that was originally released in japan in  with a  us release
the enemies can be rather creepy which adds to the overall appeal of it
the story is rather entertaining with plot twists that will keep the player going and the idea of mist being such a poisonous element to the world seems interesting in itself as there are some deserted towns that were deserted from the movement of such a lethal element
the battles have various combinations that characters can use to defeat opponents and some of the bosses will require having special moves to defeat them as they can rake up in difficulty very quickly
overall i highly recommend this game to any rpg fan looking for an original story with exciting gameplay
my two centsthis is one of the best rpgs i ever played
it has a unique combat system that inputs how youll attack by using combos with you feet and both arms
often you find a special move after using a specific combo that gives stronger attacks
i highly recommend this game to rpg lovers and playstation  gamersone of the best fighting games of its era
i highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fighting gamesi bought this game when it first came out
i immediately loved the fighting style against enemies
this game reminds me so much of final fantasy vii for the ps and it is very similar in battles except for the ability to customize hitting attacks
that is the best part of this game
if you liked final fantasy vii get this game
 stars rpg game but the battles tend to take too long sometimesand this is coming from someone who has played so many other rpg games including the very impressive legend of dragoon and also of course the famous final fantasy gamesthe characters for one are quite memorable
lets take noa first
she eventually will become if not your strongest then second strongest in the entire group
her speed is superior over the mens and thus makes her deliver some hard hits
she became my best fighter and unlike others she was my favorite character
many here say that noa is annoying but honestly people she was raised her whole life in a cave without any human contact
of course she doesnt understand how to behave in public how could she
so i think reviewers should cut the game some slack with her since theyre just trying to make her realisticgala is a great fighter due to his body strength
he eventually hits the hardest and does great damage to the enemies
gala himself is a rather interesting character as well
at first he doesnt warm up to either vahn and noa but only because of his extreme dislike for seru and anyone who wears them
when he finds out how special ra seru though he warms up and becomes a willing and actually humorous charactervahn is the one you have to control
he only speaks what you choose for him to say but everyone loves him
hes the nice guy and a good fighter as well
hes not as quick as noa or as strong as gala but nonetheless when you get his levels up he can be a great fighter as wellnow for the game itself it is a very fun and long game
if youre not patient enough to last through a long video game then you better steer clear of this game
it took me  hours to finish it and thats mainly because every town that was filled with the mist i stuck around before saving it to level up a bit more
some people i notice complain of how hard the bosses are
i found none of the bosses truly hard at all even the final boss i did not break a sweat over
maybe because i have played so many other rpgs that they were easy but i think even someone not really into rpgs could easily beat the bosses of the game
its just i think a lot of people didnt level up as much as they should have
at the very end of the game i was at level  for my group and that was more than enough for me to beat the gameleveling up can be a pain once all three characters get to higher levels but the bosses are easy to beat as long as you level up a few in every mist filled town
so i advise gamers to do so
also leveling up the magic creatures your ra seru takes in as is very easy and necessary just use them frequently in battle and they will easily level up in no timealso it is smart to level up anyway to get a lot of money
because i do agree with one complaint the weapons in this game cost a lot of money eventually
i think the point is to fight a lot so you dont have a money problem but i do agree the weapons still especially towards the end of the game get to be too pricey
just fight a bit or even sell an accessory you dont wear and you will eventually find the money for themthe plot and subplots of this game is what keeps you overall entertained
i wont repeat what the amazon review already has wrote out so well but the basic goal throughout the game is to destroy the mist all over the world by reviving genesis trees and destroying mist generators
along the way many interesting characters come along and you fight a few and help a fewthe best part of the game is definitely the outfits though the three get to wear
the new weapons and armor they wear are always different in appearance and visually appealing
noas outfits are especially beautiful
its worth the money i think to pay for themso overall this is a long and very creative game
the storylines throughout the game connect well and the plot itself unravels well as you go along
the characters are likeable and as said before the battle scenes are visually appealing and fun
the levels do take awhile as you get up to higher numbers but you do not need at all to get anywhere near level  as said before i beat the game easily at level  i would say the only really minor negative parts are the long levels and amount of money for armor other than that this game is a true joy
highly recommend for people who like games such as final fantasyi already had this game back in  but lent it to a friend and never got it back so i have already played it and decided to get it again and i have to say its by far my favorite psone game ever
the  reason i love this game is the execution of the super hyper and miracle arts
i have a few other reasons but im only listing the first onein  everyone had gotten all excited about final fantasy viii what a mistake that was while this game would be the one to keep rpgers satisfied until then
while it clearly isnt that remarkable for the new generation legend of legaia was every rpgers dream
a rich well thought out battle system with an excellent storyline to boot
not only that but the game was extremely difficult
a vast world full of sidequests and mini games as well as one of the hardest optional bosses in rpg historyfirst the graphics
this was probably one of the last rpgs made to use the blocky polygons but the graphics were exquisite
especially in battle
when seeing characters in battle the game actually viewed your characters in full armor
if you took armor off and placed on a different armor it showed
when did final fantasy do that
outside of battle the graphics are colorful and towns are nice and easy to navigatenow for what i think made legend of legaia pretty interesting as far as rpgs go
the battle system was probably one of the best battle systems i saw
first you selected to fight in a battle
then with each character you selected several chains to connect together to form a combo think of street fighter
you watch them perform the combo and do an art technique that consumed ap
the only way to gain your ap back was to be attacked attack without using arts or to select a command called quotspiritquot which replaces what we often call quotdefendquot or quotguardquot
the only flaw with this system
well gaining ap takes longer than it actually sounds and for that battles get to be very long
boss battles can take as long as an hour because of thisthe storyline is that god created humans
but the humans were unable to fend off monsters that covered the land
so god gave them a power in which to aid them
it was called the seru
humans grew reliable on seru and began to do things that they otherwise couldnt do
things such as fly or become incredibly strong
but one day that came to an end when out of nowhere the mist covers the land in which the humans live on
the mist causes the seru to go insane and attack the humans casuing disaster in the land of legaia
thus the legend beginslearning magic wasnt entirely original but it was different from what i was used to
you were bestowed with a raseru and when you attacked certain enemies they would either die or they would turn into a magic spell for you to keep
this was a great idea but learning magic is very annoying at times when you must fight the same enemies over and over againmy cons with the game
the character developement is pretty bad
the characters dont act their age
its nice that they have a background on them though
so i guess these characters are developed in some ways but theyre very unbelievable
the other con is that while the game is difficult it gets disturbingly easy as you go throughwell somewhat
every moment in this game before the final boss is really hardthen you get to that final boss and hes so incredibly easy
another bad thing about the game is that there is this hidden boss named lapis who does several points of damage to you
this is one of the hardest bosses in legend of legaia and possibly rpg history
what makes it bad though is that the reward for defeating him is nothing special so of course defeating the boss is only for bragging rightsthe music in this game is superb
the moment is always set and the music makes you feel as if youre in a fantasy
a type of music that i dont always get
the game is also full of mini games and sidequests as well
not only that but the way the story unfolds is by far one of the best ways to tell this kind of story
at first it seems like a cliche but its much more than thatoverallthe goodincredible battle systemgreat storycool grapchisgreat musiclots of mini games and sidequestsa hard gamean epic adventurethe badstuff is too expensive not mentioned abovecharacters lackbattles can get really longmemory is what you need to even begin playing with your nintendo  for two reasons
first you cant play zelda without it
second because if you want to continue in a game with levels saving it will help
nintendo  memory is a high price although if you buy another version of memory it may not work
paying more is better thatn paying for a new system if it breaksthe expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread
it is the item that revived the  after dreamcast rip debuted
it makes the graphics even more superior finally putting the psx to shame
it also helped to create enormous games such as the excellent majoras mask and perfect dark
but heres the twist
if you dont allready have a pak or donkey kong  i would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of  a steal from the expansion pak at aci extremely recommend this especially for the games that have come out lately which may run slow without it
other games wont even let you play the full version enless you have an expansion pack
i speeds up the game speed and raises the graphic quality by a lot
it makes a dramatic difference to your game
go and buy it todaythis is my  favorite accesoory
it will make the graphics of dsome games better and all this other cool stuff
ffor some games you need it no matter what like donkey kong for any post zelda oot n hit this device is a must havegreat product glad nintendo decided to come out with it
boosts ram for the  which greatly improves gameplayfor anyone who still owns or wants to buy a n you simply must have the expansion packbanjo tooiedonkey kong  all made great use of the packmore rambigger and more colorful worldsit pretty much does exactly what the description saysgranted the older n games dont make use of it but the newer games doa no brainer and a must havehighly recommendedthis makes the n graphics look like ps
too bad not all the games are compatible with this
plus it adds mb more to your memory card and improves graphics sound
if u want one of these get the ones nintendo made
if u want the most out of your n look for this where ever u can
u will not regret itnote im writing this for the expansion pak produced by tomee
these third party expansion paks seem to hover together in the same listing
so just keep that in mind if you go taking my advice
if im not mistaken this is an aftermarket expansion pak
ive heard some bad things about the tomee controllers floating around but the expansion pak actually seems to work pretty well
i bought one produced by interact a more reputable thirdparty manufacturer years ago and theres no apparent difference in quality
as ive never owned the nintendo version of the expansion pak i cant really say how it compares to the first party quality
however there shouldnt really be any difference
its just ramnow i can play four man matches in wwf no mercy without considerably low frame rate and lag
great product and shipped fastthis expansion pack allows you to play better games and increases the graphics on the nathis is a needed tool for the gameshark pro and certain games like zelda
if you do not need it pick it up for a little extra detail in all of your games
it makes everything look great and it stops the slowdown that games like no mercy havei bought this expansion pak for a n that i picked up at a thrift store and it works great
you need this accessory if you plan on playing some of the more graphicintensive n gamesgetting this new was the best way for me
cant play majoras mask without it d plus its a good find for us who still play the nintendo  gamesmy n restarted for no reason every now and again and the xpack fixed that
totally worth owning if you own any of the later n titlesits totally worth it for the high rez version of ep racer and the ability to play dk and pdthe expansion pack beefs up the graphics capability of the standard nintendo  unit
this in itself should make any gamer run out and grab one  when you compare the price of this to the price of one of the new consoles youre saving tons of moneywhat does it do
for some games that work both with and without the expansion pack it greatly increases the types of graphics shown during gameplay
pod racer is a stellar example
play without the pack and you get rings and blocky graphics
add in the pack and you suddenly have lens flare details of ships racing beside you crucial information about upcoming turns
it makes the game play the way the developers intendedits like watching the matrix on a shoddy vhs tape copied from a friend and then seeing it on dvd
its an amazing difference for a very low pricein addition many new games coming out are so graphicintensive that they require the expansion pack to even play
the legend of zelda majoras mask is a key example
this is an excellent game with great extended gameplay but you cant even start if you dont have this pack in placeits not difficult to install  you simply plug it in once and it stays there permanently
you can still play older games with it in place
if youre paying  for games why not pay out for this expansion that will make them all play better and give you access to the newer gamesthis red pak is intended for expending ram space for n games i strongly recommend it for a gamers enjoymentmust have for certain games like legend of zelda majoras mask
it is required or you will not be able to play the game at all
supposed to enhance graphics for all games as wellif you have an n you must get an expansion pak
the expansion pak increases the graphics and the speed of some of the newers games on the n
some of the newest ones will not play with out it
like some people have said this is just like adding ram to a pc
its easy and fast and ive had no problems with mine
if you have an n buy an expansion pak
you will not regret iti know the kids needed this for something but dont know why
i believe its still working as they still play well if you need it and your games require it or just want a boost of video memory in your n then get this it helps dmake sure you check to see youve got the ram expansion in your n
if you havent go ahead and order one
a lot of great games require it like perfect dark and donkey kong  it isnt groundbreaking technology or anything but its one of those things like guns condoms first aid kits or umbrellas  better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have iti needed this to play majoras mask im glad i could find one with a reasonable price even  years later
several laten games need one of these if your game is one of these than here ya goyou get what you came for its an expansion pak to play larger n games and it makes all your other n games run smoother
n looks cool now that its got a red hood ornament hahaand it makes the turok  and  look better
if you have an n and want to experience some of the best it has to offer than this expansion pack is essentialits cheap its memory so its excellent
memory always does a good job to any gamesoftware and you can see that by donkey kong  international superstar soccer  zelda majoras mask and other great games that support the expansion packdont waste your time if you pretend to continue playing nintendo  games you will need to gear upsuch a necessity that once i received it for christmas i got rid of the jumper pak for goodthe expansion pak holds much more memoryif you have games that need it ask mom and dad night and day to buy you an expansion pakyou really have no need for the jumper pakthe jumper pak is really hard to get out anywayi had to use a knife to get the jumper pak out which cant be too good for the system but what the hey now the expansion pak is in and i dont need to worry anymorethe nintendo  memory expansion pak upgrade is not vital for the most part in terms of plugging up and playing many of the great titles already released for this console
but there are a few titles that absolutely require this upgrade
the legend of zelda majoras mask and donkey kong  are two such titles for example that cannot be accessed without this upgrade
perfect dark is one such title which offers minimal gameplay and locks players out of many of its richer features due to the lack of available memory to run all of its features properly
but i think youll find that even if donkey kong  perfect dark or zelda majoras mask isnt your thing youll still be wanting to consider purchasing this ram expansion for a few key reasonsimproved gameplay details
a lot of games weather you know this or not offer very fine gameplay oriented details not available without extended memory
most games are capable of improved framerate improves quality of onscreen action
prevents slow down effects when a lot of on screen action is occuring for example
programers can implement more textures and details to environments and characters making things look more lively or life like
ai artificial intelligence can be improved and become smarter the second drastic improvement is audiovisual quality
most people that dont understand how computer games really work or dont know all the technical terms have a commen misconception that this expansion pak is supposed to improve the graphics in a way that might take the console beyond its  bit capabilities
this isnt true
rather the expansion pak improves color quality and helps to reduce the blurry effect of the colors in most games creating better visual clarity
much of the blocky character sprites but not all of course will appear smooth and less blockish or choppy
with the improved framerate you may even notice how the environment in some games can pan out further while maintaining a smooth look allowing the player to see further away from the character than they could with the jumper pakthe memory expansion for n is relatively cheap now that the console itself is two generations removed behind gamecube and wii
and if your still into retro gaming or just enjoy playing the nintendo  even after all these years i would certainly recommend this buy
even if you never play the games which require the upgrade i would consider this because of its ability to enhance visual clarity
couple the memory expansion up with a videos cable and you will still find an appeal to the outdated graphics of a system of yorean expansion pack is essential as more and more games are coming out where you need to use the expansion pack
the expansion pack improves graphics on games like south park and star wars and is essential to play games like zelda majoras mask and perfect dark
the graphics are greatly improved that if you put two monitors together with one having a nintendo with an expansion pack and one without an expansion pack you would be able to see the difference
dont miss out on some of the best games about at the moment buy an exoansion pack and enjoyi must admit i was a tad dissapointed that we had to buy this thing in order to play some games for the n
not that many require it but the  best games do require it to get the best performance out of it
as the  days of nintendo went by so did the games and so did my endless day in the  house and not leaving it to play with my n
ive come to the  realization that the pak does help out much with many games that dont even  require it
a fact that you might not know about the expansion pak is that  it does in fact help every n game out there however not all of them  take in the dramatic effect that it has to offer
games not designed for  it wont use it as much or as well as games that do work with it will  however little things can be improved
as with the n expansion pak  ive noticed that many games designed for it work more than well on the  system and are greatly improved
as the fact that nintendo is pushing out  games that now require it majoras mask dkit is vital to have it
a  tad pricey yes but beneficial all the samelots of games require this to be installed so it is a must
 stars because it is needed to play one of the zeldasworks great just like any n expansion pak
nothing much to really say about it
its a good product and if you have an n you should definitely get one
increases ram from mb to mb which basically means better graphics and more visually appealing gamesi still remember as a kid on my birthday when my dad bought me a n with a bunch of games including donkey kong  a few months ago i bought the n from one of my old friends and a while after i bought donkey kong and other games at a flea market but i had forgotten that to play donkey kong it required the expansion pak so i came here bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did all it came in was in one of those orange envelope things  it wasnt even wrapped in anything when i opened it it was just right there but its cool cause at least the inside was insulated with bubble wrap kept it safe  it looked brand new
im just happy now that i can play again one of the games i played when i was like around  years old and now im simply awesome
if you havent already played it get it youre gauranteed to love it
its the birth of spectacular stealth adventures
and you can buy it for as little as three dollars on amazon and it will play on playstation arrived in a timely manner and in great condition
no problems with the game and thoroughly enjoyed playing it
recommended to those who grew up with the psduring one of my many ventures to my local game store a year and a half ago i came across a game called syphon filter
intrigued i went ahead and bought it popped it in my psone and to this day it is one of the best games i have ever played
i have beat the st nd and rd and am on my second pass through the series
i will then give the omega strain a go on my ps once i am finished with sf
while i have read no so favorable reviews on os i think it would be fair to at least give it a tryyou are gabe logan a special operative for a super secret government orginization aptly named the agency
your mission is to find a dangerous chemical stolen by terrorists from a lab and stop them before they destroy the world
you are remotely partnered with lian xing another agent who guides you through your missions and later on in the game is in action on the groundyou are gradually given an arsenal of weapons as each level moves forward
among them are there is the silenced mm handgun the  handgun the g pistolmachine gun  the hk pistol machine gun the shotgun the combat shotgun the pk assault rifle the m assault rifle and the kg assault rifle just to name a fewin each mission based level you must accomplish a variety of objectives and eliminate a tough boss at different intervals
you will use stealth at times or just face enemies head on
the interesting part about this game is that it really draws you in and takes some interesting twists and turns as it progressesas for gameplay it is fantastic and addicting
while the levels are challenging and tough at times they are not overly frustrating or extremely hard
some levels and missions are easy and others will take a few times to get through
it will be a bit of a challenge if you play this for the first time but you wont become overwhelmed as in similar games
as you play it a second and third timethough you will become familiar with the layout of the levels and more or less breeze through
as an example i was able to shoot down the chopper on the base tower after  tries as opposed to  attempts during my first run through the game over a year ago
you will also attain some tricks along the way as well such as becoming more effective at headshots and so on
i have found that its the little things that get you through this gameas for game layout and graphics excellent imo for  ps
great voice animations and camera angles as wellwhile there are many new games out especially in the wake of the xbox  and psp releases i still encourage you to give this masterpiece a try
you wont be disappointedsyphon filter is a awesome game it was pretty advance in stealth reminded me of mg and splinter cell i only wish they would remake it and the others for ps with updated graphicsthis is one of the classics here
same as syphon filter  i loved this game  years ago and i wanted to buy it and play it again
its fantastic with the rollings and all the weaponsgreat gamethis game is indeed what started it all
the graphics were great considering its an early psone release
the storyline is a bit farfetched and predictable but likeable and face it youve seen worse
the controls are extremely easy to work with the missions are satisfactory and you get to shoot ppl
what more do you wantthe good a lot of excelent guns decent story with memorable characters genius level design tight controls and camera varied objectives and localesthe bad flimsy stealth some levels are confusing a little shortthird person shooters werent very frequent on ps and when they did come by they were usually pretty bad
syphon filter proved that you can make this genre work on the ps
the game is still really fun today and was way ahead of its time
a well done camera great lockon system a decent story with memorable characters a kickass arsenal of guns and genius level design
who would have thought a third person shooter would be this good in the late s
eidetic and  studios didyou play as super spy gabriel logan who is a cia agent trying to stop a dangerous terrorist named eric rhoemer
a syphon filter virus that targets specific dna demographics has been created by a man named phagan and it is up to you to shut down their operations and stop them from spreading the virus
you start out in new york with the streets being shot up by rhoemers thugs
there are objectives in each level to complete but it is way beyond throw this switch pull this lever or shoot this amount of bad guys
you usually have to kill a certain amount of scientists administer vaccines to victims disarm bombs turn off power grids
the objectives vary but what is fun is figuring out how to get theresyphon filter has some of the most memorable levels i can remember
this is a game you play several times and remember where every enemy is every crate location and even how to kill each enemy
the levels vary with stealth sections climbing and timed areas
the game features a smart lockon system because there is no camera control
it is surprisingly smart and follows you wherever you go
enemies wearing flak jackets can only be taken out with head shots or very powerful weapons
this requires aiming in first person mode and taking them out
this flak jacket element is a staple of the series and will go on to be in every game
it is actually an element all on its own and not just body armor for you or the enemy
you can die very easily and if you dont stop and aim for head shots you will waste ammo andor die very quicklythere are a couple of boss fights thrown in such as a helicopter midway and rhoemer himself at the end
i found all gameplay elements to be evenly tossed up so you are never bored
the stealth elements need a bit of work and are probably the worst thing about the game but it is very minor
crouching and sneaking around works fine but enemies tend to see you at unknown distances
maybe a line of sight cone on the radar would help this
you also have to get in head shots otherwise they wont die right away and alert other guardsweapon selection is also a bit flimsy because you have to hold down select and use l and r strafe buttons to select the weapon
i would have preferred a radial menu instead
some levels can be a bit hard to navigate are too dark to see
thankfully you get a flashlight you can equip because some levels are nearly pitch black
i found myself lost a few times because even though the level design is fantastic some levels can look the same with confusing hallways and misplaced crates and boxesi actually learned about weapons as a kid from this game
real world weapons are in here and some that i have never seen in any other game before
the weapons are almost a character all on their own because they feel so good to shoot in the game
the kg will cut through flak jackets easily and is probably the only weapon that will do this
the g is a super fast submachine pistol while the silenced mm is a staple of the series
the shotgun combat shotgun pk biz nightvision rifle  hk and a few more are all excellent weapons
it was also the distinct sounds the developers used that make these guns so memorable
the game has a great sniper scope that was unseen in games back then
there are grenades and gas grenades which are great for taking out a group of enemies stealthily
there are a lot of great weapons in the game and they are very memorable unlike most shooterswhile the game itself is amazing the graphics were pretty good at the time
looking pretty realistic art wise the game had some good lighting effects and a lot of detail everywhere
i also have many fond memories of this game as a kid
i actually accidentally rented silent hill because i forgot the name of this game
i got all the way to the pharcom warehouse levels and had to turn the game in
i rented this game many times over and played it to death as a kid
i purchased it a few times here and there and every time i play this it brings back fond memories
syphon filter is one of the greatest games ever made and every gamer should play this masterpieceand youre the chosen one for thisprosmissions are very fun to playnice aresonal of weaponskg will rip through those flak jacketsvery adictive gameplaypretty good musicthis game will last for a whilesuperb sound effectsbosses put up a pretty good fightaltho i dont like to cheat its a easy way to get all the levels and gunswith infinite ammoput it on hard to push your skills to the limitat  bux go grab a classicconsnot so good graphicsfaces are flat in fmvsi hate some stealth missionsvoice acting is pretty badsome missions are repetitvewhy does gabe run like he gotta crap his pantsthis game was definitly overshadowed by the imfamus metal gear solid
but that dont mean the game didnt sell it reached the over the two million mark and after playing it through i see why
if you love metal gear solid go check this outfinal wordsthis game was great no doubt but syphon filter  was a bit worse and it missed out on the combat shotgundont get me wrong its still a good game not as good as the first
now i dunno why they put out syphon filter  that game stinks
now there putting the climax of the series on the ps syphon filter omega strain online
lets just hope omega strain can be as fun as this classicpeacei loved playing this game back in  so i decided to buy it to have it on my game collection
this game has lots of action stealth strategy and the plot is awesome
id recommend itthis is one of the game that u will remember for the rest of your lifethe game is really fun the tutorial guide really helps the auto targetting is good but not perfect and this game is actually lot easier than its other partsgraphics  the characters look kind of flat and enviroment could have been a little more polishedsound  the background music to the bullets really coolcontrols  good but kind of twitchy in tight spotsoverall this game is just fun to play the story and the gamelay is awesomethis game is fun for the exact opposite reason that metal gear solid is fun
in this game stealth isnt of much importance while quickly killing all the bad guys on the screen is important
like most action games this one is staged out into many different missions which usually have five or six objectives in order throughout the level
my personal favorite aspect of this game is the target system which locks on to the enemy of your choice making the game easier in a crowded room of enemies
syphon filter is one great pure action gameno complaints here some parts of it became rather frustrating however
a nice venture into a new series too bad it was slowed down by poor story telling in later gamesthe original syphon filter trilogy set the standard to what the arcade style military third person shooter was to be on that generation of console
whether youre an old school collector or someone thats looking to properly emulate old school games on a pc this game is one every good boy and girl should havethis game rocks the most
quite possibly the best racing game for the n beetle adventure racing packs so much into a single game pak that you wonder just what exactly does go on inside of that cartridge
unlike other n racing games bar look just as darn good as anything youd find on many dreamcast games
the graphics are lush
plus theres stuff going on off of the track
trains go by warehouses operate and some freaky looking pumpkin things dance around
it offers much more to look at than say any crusin title
the control is superb even the poor handling cars are a blast to play with
theres a goldeneye multiplayer rip off where your car is outfitted with missles and bombs and the such
you get to go around collecting beetles which is just an excuse to kick the living daylights out of your annoying kid brother
not that we cough ever do thatthis is a good game to play when you figure out how to play it
i am still trying to figure out how to do some of the stunts on the gamethis is a racing game for anyone and it features only the new version of the best selling car of all time the volkswagen beetle
it is a great game with different difficulty levels in the championships challenging opponents and progressively harder courses
this is also a great game for multiplayer with the very original and fun quotbeetle battlequotcoursescoventry cove  a simple course for beginners not very hard and many interesting shortcutsmount mayhem  significantly harder than coventry cove this course takes you on a trip through a deckedout mountain with many surprises and shortcuts and even a ski jump that you can take your car off ofinferno isle self explanitory
its a course taking place on an island that is competing with a volcano and there is also a spot where you can dive into the volcano not into the lava of course but into the volcano for that mattersunset sands egyptian themed course running through ruins
unlike the other courses this one has shortcuts that make a very significant difference in your positionmetro madness  also selfexplanitory
a drive through the city streets at top speed and an interesting shortcut that literally lets you drive through a hotelwicked woods a quotscaryquot drive through a sleepy hollow style setting
rightfully the hardest course in the gamealtogether i think that this is a game for anyone into the volkswagen beetle racing games or multiplayer
it combines the best interests of all elements of the racing gamebeetle adventure racing is a fun racing game for all ages
the graphics are amazing for a nintendo  the championship mode is a little to easy though
but i really love the beetle battle mode especially with four players
it deserves  stars by far
it is a game well worth the money
it will keep you entertained for hours played levels earning cars and much morethis one makes the street fighter games on super nes look so lame
it has lots of combos the appointeds move very fast
you can always tag team your partner during the game
when you do your signature move the back ground looks has flashing lights speaking of background i have to say what amazing d graphics
even though this game says marvel vs street fighter doesnt mean only the super heros fight the street fighters you can make spider man fight one of the xmen
i guset they got the idea to make this game is cause the japanese are have great animes these and the us challenges themthis is probably one of the most exciting and intense racing games i have ever played
set in the star wars universe this is definitely one thats sure to last a long long timeits a surprisingly long game although  it didnt take too long to beat
it also has great replay value and i  enjoy it now just as much as i did when i first purchased it
throughout  the game and as you advance through the various courses you will be able  to implement the money you earn to purchase better parts for your  particular pod racer
as you advance youll also be able to select more  powerful and occasionally weaker pods to test out
run through each of  them and see which fits you best
it might be the difference between  coming out on top or being involved in the biggest explosion since the  death startheres also an amazing score of wonderful john williams  music from episode i there are various tracks for each course and they  add an even better thrill to the game
the graphics are also very good  much better than on the n
if you have a good computer and a decent d  card you should have no problems
i have a mhz system with a voodoo  and it rockedall in all lucasarts has done it again
may the force be  with you
believe me youll need iti bought it when it first came out for full price and thought i might have wasted my moneylet me tell yano wayi didnt waste one pennyits like racing indy cars but much faster they turn easier and they flythere are  levels to this game
level one has  races all aare pretty easy
after you finish the level you are given access to one level in level each level is the same but each getting harderthere are  races in level four and let me tell yathey are hard
i still havnt completed races  and  in level 
the graphics are top notch
the compant lucasarts produces the best graphics in computer games
the game follows the story line of the movie well
sure the tracks are on differant planets than just tatooine but hey its fun
 i love the game
and the characters from the movie you can play all of them
the one thing that is not like the movie but im glad it is on the game is the quotyou get a new podracerquot feature when you crashits a life saver
all around i give this game a  maybe  thumbs upjason andersonthis game is just awsomeand give jake a break he was a little kid at the timelike to see u guys do a better jobim not going to bother explaining what tetris is as by now all of you have been laying bricks for the past two decadesinstead i will explain why this just might be the best tetris since the originalexcept for missing the catchy original tetris music this versian improves vastly over the originalgiving the game a nice color overhaul made it really pretty to look at and they beefed it up with several features i wished were in the original without ruining it like they did in tetris worlds for the gbafor example there is a save anywhere feature so you can play it anytime you want
also how many of us wish that you could play tetris against another
well in the origianl you had to have a buddy who had a link cabe a gameboy and a copy of tetris to play
you still have to do that in this versian but you can also challenge the computer to matches and it will send you garabge blocks just like it would if you were playing one of your friends
you can set the difficulty three levels and the higher you set it the more aggressive the computer becomesalso my main complaint with tetris worlds was there was no scoring feature but this versian has plenty and even saves the when you turn off the game
not even the original did that
at least not in my gb gamethere is the view next piece feature but you can turn it off if you wish but there is noinfinate rotate feature or ghostshadow piece to let you see when to drop iti was very disappointed with the gba tetris worlds and its funny that i should tell people to go buy this instead of the gba game but this one is worth the purchase folksget this and forget there ever was a tetris worlds as this one improves over the original in almost all ways exept the musici would have liked the russian tetris music instead we get this weird technopop musicthis is the best puzzle game ever made
although i love the puyo puyo style games dr mario columns bust a move etc
 i have to say that tetris is the cream of the crop
after all tetris is what sold the original gameboy and it was logical to make tetris dx a launch title when the game boy color came out
i bought the gbc the day it was released and i bought tetris dx the next week and tetris dx is one of the mostplayed titles on my gbcthe sheer addictiveness of the game is so frickin awesome and i love how blocks fall faster in later levels so it has an s oldschool style to iti love quotold schoolquot gamesi have both this game and tetris worlds for game boy advance and i love them both as much as the other
tetris worlds my not have a battery backup but it more than makes up for that with the extremely fun game variations and the classic tetris musictetris dx does have a battery but its just basic tetris
im able to score at least  points regularly so every time i top out i have to put up with that annoying rocket launch sequence wheras with tetris worlds when you top out you can start the next game right away without having to put up with annoying rocket sequences
the bottom line went i want to play classic tetris i play tetris dx
when i want enhanced graphics and effects and nostalgic music i play tetris worldswhen the original game boy launched in  tetris was the pack in cartridge that introduced the world to one of the most recognized games ever
almost ten years later right after the release of the game boy color nintendo releases a colorful port of an addictive puzzle game we came to know and love
tetris dx is the original game boy tetris now in color and adds two more game modes and  player vs support
it was still great to play as it is noweveryone knows what tetris is so i wont explain it as many other reviewers have done so already
tetris dx gets the full color support and has three game modes marathon keep playing until its game over ultra score as many points as you can in  minutes and  lines clear  lines as fast as you can
you can connect another game boy color from another player and play against himher and even send your high scores over to hisher copy of the gameits a great game overall with lots of re playability
if you had friends then it was twice as fun to play against the other person and see who gets the highest score
though nowadays there are better versions of tetris on the market this will always remain a classic
it was a treat for game boy color owners and was one game everyone got intoyou will love tetris dx
i had the tetris gold collection from spectrum holobyte cd for windows and i didnt think i would like this one but it  hooked me
you can change the music pause the game and it keeps  of your  highest scores
very addictive and enjoyabletetris dx is a very fun game
you will be addicted to it in no time
there are many different things you can do to change the game settings
for example you can change the music
you can also change the level you are on yourself although i wouldnt recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player
there also many game modes you can play in like  lines on which you have to get  lines without your blocks hitting the top marathon on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top or ultra where you see how good you can do except you only have  minutes to do so
the computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level
tetris dx is an absolutely terrific game
i would recommend it to anybody
youll have a lot of fun playing it
thank you for reading my review
i hope it helpedtetris is a videogame that needs no introduction
you probably know how to play it and if you dont im sure theres some sort of free online download thatll get you startedwhat makes tetris dx my personal favorite of all the iterations is that it gets the extra details just right
the music is solid and while i prefer the nes versions tracks this versions music is pretty goodthe colors are beautiful
the game changes backgrounds as you advance in the game
i strongly recommend a game boy advance sp because seeing this game nowadays is trickier than it used to be
that bloody ds has spoiled us
the sound effects on the gaming board never grow old
that might not seem important but since youre gonna be rotating pieces and forming lines and tetrises nonstop youll be gratefulthe postgame rocket launches there are about  the higher score the more elaborate the launch are nice additions
whats pretty funny is that with the exception of the best spaceship launch all the others fail for silly reasons
the weakest one gets distracted by a bird and just flies off the left side of the screenthere are  save game slots and a guest file
so all your hard work will never be erased
i think even a guests high scores will be saved as long as it topples the saved files
but in any event this is a very userfriendly gamethere are  modes of gameplay
classic is your traditional game of tetris
ultra is the same as classic but the gaming board is shorter
 lines is just trying to clear  lines as fast as possible with some obstacle pieces thrown in
aside from the regular classic mode vscom is my favorite because when facing an offscreen opponent on hard difficulty you better bring your agame
classic and vs are endlessly fun while the other two features are decent additionsunfortunately you will need some oldschool game boy link cables to play with  human people
if competition against live opponents is what you crave then getting tetris ds or the console versions is the way to gobut if youre a solo player i believe tetris dx is the absolute best
the game just has a smooth flow to it
i loved the ds version but hated that the classic mode stopped after  lines
because of the ds versions other unique features thats also well worth your time and moneyits also worth mentioning that even though this game is advertised as a game boy color itll play just fine the oldschool game boy
im not sure about the game boy advance units thoughtetris dx is easily the best choice if youre looking for oldschool tetris with the best available presentation and limitless singleplayer gaming
grab a game boy and have some fun
it wont cost muchwowthe only game boy games that even come close to this are probably mario golf and super mario bros dx
the game starts off when you wake up in a bed on koholint island and you must recover your sword and shield
once you go down to the shore and pick up your sword an owl tells you that you must wake the wind fish but in order to do that you need the eight instruments of the sirens from the eight levelstail cave bottle grotto key cavern anglers tunnel catfishs maw face shrine eagles tower turtle rock
in these levels you pick up a good variety of items
you get the rocs feather for jumping the power braclet for picking up rocks the pegasus boots for running really fast the flippers for swimming the hookshot for clearing long gaps a more powerful power bracelet a mirror shield for reflecting beams and the magic rod for melting ice
but some of these levels have keys and to get the slime keylevel  and the angler key you will be running crazy all across the island
along with that are other side missions
there is a trading game through the entire game which will lead you getting the magnifying lens and with which you can see a man on the shore who will trade you whatever is in your b buttonuse the shovel for a fine boomerang
there are also a good deal of secret seashells and if you get  you can get the level  sword which can shoot beams at full power
you also get a couple friends along the way
for getting into the second level you get to walk bowwow the big chain chomp that lives next to marin and tarin
he will eat the poisonous plants in front of the entrance
you can also revive the flying rooster a rooster that you pick up for full flight so you can get the bird key
but never forget the main mission wake the wind fish
for he is not the only one inside the eggthe first game of the zelda series that is made for gameboy color the legend of zelda links awakening dx is one of the most memberable zelda games
this time link doesnt have to save the world but rather himself
while link is sailing on the ocean his boat is struck by a lightning bolt causing his ship to wrecktossed about in the water he lands on an island
but since he has landed on the island all he can think of is getting off of it
but the only way he can is to awake the wind fish by obtaining all the instruments of the sirens
this game has an excellent game play and storyline
it is worth every pennylinks awakening is probably the best gameboy version of zelda ever
although that is left to ones opinionit is in my opinion however to bethe game begins with link waking up in a hut
he is told by the locals that to leave and go back to hyrule he must awaken the wind fish
it lives inside an egg on top of a nearby mountain and can only be lulled from its sleep by playing eight magical instruments
you spend your time trying to round up these eight instrumants but in order to do so you have to endure varying types of puzzles traps and enemies
each puzzle youre faced with has a logical solution and youll only come across a few situations that will require you to leave and get new items from the outside
koholint island is bigby gameboy standards anyhow  even more so when you consider the hidden underground passageways dungeons and waterways so youll have plenty of exploring to do with alot of secrets to uncover
youll definitely spend countless hours playing this gamegameboy colorgameboy advance owners are granted access to an allnew exclusive dungeonalthough it isnt required or necessary to complete the game plus those with a gameboy printer get a photo scrapbook of links adventures that you can copyhence the dxdeluxe added at the end of the title of this versionthis is one classic that shouldnt be missed
if youve played any of the other legend of zelda games you owe it to yourself to check it out
you dont know what youre missingi have to say that although this game does not include gannon or zelda it is one of my favorite zelda games
i love the story line i feel like you get to know the characters much better
its like playing a book which is how zelda games the good ones tend to feel to me
it carries a message tooi dont wish to spoil it but i will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares
of the game boy zelda games  i would recommend this one the most along with minish cap
even though this is an older one and d it still feels more like a d one because it pulls you in
its not too hard but it is a fair challenge nothing like the originals and it could be confusing if you dont know anything about zelda butfor maybe a second zelda game this is a good choicethis game is the best game ive ever played for gb
i have the original version not dx
if you dont know the difference dx is in color but the original is in shades of grey
i guess there are a couple additions in the dx game
but i repeat only a couple
but its still pretty much the same concept
there are plenty of puzzles to keep you thinking and tons of items
the bosses are pretty hard and theyre a puzzle themselves you need to find out what method and item you need to use against them
graphics are good remember im playing the original they are not exceptional but good enough that you can clearly see what things are and there is a lot of detail
the sound is good also you dont get bogged down in too many sounds at once but you can hear everything that goes on
if you like action games this is good for you but youre going to have to think so stay away if you dont like puzzles
puzzles
wow there sure are a lot of them
some of them are extremely difficult and just when you think youre going to give up or cheat off of a walkthrough you figure it out
hence its not impossible just difficult
well rpg players have a nice feasti still occasionally start a new game on this game just because i like playing it over and over again
i still cannot believe how much they put into a simple game boy cartridge
i mean this game is huge
there are  dungeons a long quottradingquot sidequest lots of heart pieces to collect  sea shells you only need  for the quotspecialquot prize ill leave that up to you and lots of miniquests you must complete before you even enter some dungeons
the story is simple but gets the point across and the graphics are optimized with the game boy color
if you havent played this game youre missing out especially if youre a fan of the zelda games andor the game boy
trust me on this one
i still remember when i first got the blackwhite version  or so years ago and it took me an hour to figure out you could use your shield on the spikey guys lol
the games bosses can actually be challenging sometimes which is something i see less and less of nowadays
once again buy this gameoh my goodness this is a speciality of y son that he likes immensely very enjoyable and you can get involved in the story by watchingever since i played ocarina of time the best game ever that has won many top ten lists i have been a devoted zelda fan
i set of to play them all
so even though this is considered an old rusty title i was set on playing it
now of the zelda titles this is one of the better ones
this game contains qualityand very few modern games are this goodif you are curious this is my third favorite game just behind ocarina of time and a link to the past
if you want a good title skip those ds games and get a copy of thisthis game is old so the music and graphics arent top notch but i still enjoyed them
it has an amazing soundtrack
i never got tired of the over world theme and the rest is memorial too
the graphics arent anything special but any well colored game is fine by methe fightingdungeons were ok they had challenge but actually i didnt find them amazing
the over world was a real treat
it was well made and fun to explore
this is were the real quality comes ini have seen better characters and storys but you cant help thinking fondly of this games storycharacter
it left a mark and i will always remember themit
it is hard to explaini can see wy this has been a favorite for many gamers for over a century
it was well make well liked and if you havent already play it
max stars
more than fiveif you get into this game it will provide you with many many hours of fun and challenges
however as with many roleplaying games if you get to a part where youre stuck you may be tempted to just quit
however theres so much good stuff in this game that i hope you wont  go find one of the  faqs or walkthroughs on the web to help you outif youre familiar with  the pokemon game this is similar but you have to fight any bad guys  instead of relying on your pokemon to do it
this requires a bit of  dexterity something you didnt really need for pokemon and also some  fast thinkingthere are a variety of puzzles in the games including  boss monsters with specific weaknesses areas to get through that require  some fancy footwork rockpushing puzzles and the usual roleplaying game  puzzles of figuring out what to do with some of the items you findits  easy in spots but challenging enough at many points to really keep your  interestthe color enhancements to the original game are nice and the  music is varied and pleasanta couple of hints for you  after you get  the boots try charging at the walls in the library
also if you get the  bow and equip with the bow and with bombs you can shoot a quotbomb  arrowquot by pressing both buttons at once
itll be like a normal  arrow but it will explode on impactthis game is totally awesome
very advanced wide variety of items enemies and places
excellent graphics even for gameboy
a very challenging adventure is in this cartridge and its tons of fun
play it on a gameboy color and you can go to a secret dungeon
its like a normal labryinth and instead of getting an instrument you get red clothes which doubles your offense permanently or blue clothes which doubles your defense permanently my personal choice
superb game
excellent adventurewith the minish cap coming out soon and looking to be another disappointment i will reserve final judgment until i actually play it but it has a definite wind waker vibe the handheld gamer would do well to revisit this classic
the gameplay is incredible and compelling and the story is perhaps the best in the series the only two faults with this game are minor for any true gamer
the graphics arent very good the sprites are simply poorerquality a link to the past sprites oftentimes but the game is so good one will hardly notice
the sound effects are pretty poor but thankfully theres always the music to compensate for thatand what good musicit feels like alttp looks like it plays like it and is second only to that excellent snes gamethis rpg roleplaying game is pretty easy to play and lasts a long time
to play you simply asign a weapon such as a sword or the hook shot to a or b  the battle sequences are very good for a d system and allow fun battles
its often hard to find out what to do but usually isnt frustratingly difficult
many secrets are available which while unnecessary make it easier and make it last longer
i recommend this game for all peoplebefore game boy advance there was game boy
on game boy there was links awakening
the legend of zelda links awakening was the best game for game boy at the time and still remains much more than a simple piece of nostalgia
will links awakenings graphics turn you off
they are still crisp today and the color version should alleviate some of the dated aspects of las graphics but dont expect bit goodness that we might see in a gba zelda game
the sound is traditional zelda fare with some nowclassic tunes this was the game that introduced the now popular quotinstrumentquot item that does neat stuff for youmake no mistake about it  links awakening is a great game a force to be reckoned with and a savior for kids on long car trips
the puzzles in this game were particularly good the storyline was new and refreshing and the game was really fun
replay value is high even though you will face the same dungeon challenges but one time through this game might be enough since its length is decent even by todays standards
if you dont own a gba definitely buy this game
if you own a gba  definitely buy this game anyway
play it and love itthis review refers to the dx version that was released on game boy color but it is not worth owning independently of the original game boy version
certainly if buying this game today get the dx version
if you just really love links awakening dont overkill it  owning both is just sillybesides this again being a repurchased item and a older game it was fun to play again despite horrible older graphicsif you overlook this game because you think it is quotkiddiequot then you are missing out on a great rpg adventure
go ahead bite the bullet and playawesome classic
nintendo made one great game here i hope kids these days will still play the oldieswe probably all know about the hype that pokemon pocket monsters has received about  years ago
it started off as a game that originated in japan around  and it was introduced to the united states in  a tv show and a trading card series followed
plush pikachu dolls were everywhere
i was a big fan of this fad and i was only in the th grade late  when i purchased this game and strapped in for the time of my lifethis is the blue version of the original game boy series
just like in the red version there are pokemon that cannot be captured ekans magmar scyther growlith and mankey just to name a few and a trade cable will be required to fulfill catching them all but heres a little lowdown and some advice to some starters of this gameyou are given one out of three pokemon to start out with bulbasaur charmander squirtle and note that your first trainer is brock who uses the rock type
i recommend you choose squirtle if you want to take it easy at first because it learns bubble at level  bulbasaur is also a good choice but it doesnt learn vine whip until level 
im explaining the best moves to defeat brocks pokemon
charmander is not a good bet but good for a challenge
when you get to pewter city however dont rush to battle brock until you feel like you are prepared
metapod and kakuna give out a lot of experience points so that leveling is easier and if you catch a caterpiemetapod and raise it to a level  butterfree it can also help defeat brock as well with its confusion skillif youre familiar with the later games of this series youll realize a lot of differences
you can hold only  different types of items at a time including pokeballs and key items
and you gotta love the cheesy pokemon graphicsdespite some flaws that havent been perfected until the later games of the series this is still a classic gameand im not a big fan of rpg style games but this is the easiest and less stressful of them in my opinion
recommendedpurchased for my son
he used birthday money to buy an old gameboy color and wanted pokemon for it
none of the local stores has a used game in stock with a good battery
this had a new battery installed and works greati love this gametheres tons of weird creatures called pokemon to catch and a lot of things to do as wellthe really nice thing about pokemon blue is the fact that blastoise has really  cool movesthis is a game that anyone who owns a game boy should own
ya gotta get this game its so goodpokemon was immensely popular in the late s to early s and still has quite a fan base here in the new decade
pokemon blue along with red was a remarkable feat that blended fun as well as underlying lessons for many kids
as daunting as the task is ash ketchum must show that he is the pokemon master and the better of the two when face to face with gary oak his nemesis
during your journey youll encounter gym masters fun places to explore new pokemon and much more
a truly fun and epic adventurethis game has many underlying lessons like cities with different colors  many of which i didnt know existed  like lavender saffron and indigo
 exploration  the idea of getting used to trying new things and ultimately carefully looking everywhere to find what needs to be found pokemon names  the many pokemon names were cleverly named to highlight its characteristics like mime diglett bulbasaur starmie ditto drowzee etc
my vocabulary expanded and i learned so much
the pokemon alone are so immensely helpful in making words make sense
 perseverance  when you lose the battle its simple you just come back and try again until you achieve the mission or catch the pokemon you want
its immediately built into the psyche of the gamer
the game makes ash ketchum such a relateable and likeable characterthe subtle educational aspect of this game is astounding and im very glad that i was one of the kids in my day playing pokemon bluethe original and best pokemon game in the series in my opinion
collect all of the original pokemon to become a masterit has always been a habit for children to exhibit and swap their cardstickertoy collections with their friends in school
the premise of pokemon to collect and train pokemon  was the perfect fertile growing field to exploit this fascination children had with collecting things
the first exploit was the tv show where the characters in the videogame were rendered onto the tv screen
when that became popular enough the creators rendered the full  pokemon into thousands of different incarnations
pokemon tshirts teddybears actionfigures trading cards stickers watches etc were all created under the slogan youve gotta catch em all parents had a rotten time thats for sure
and it was this capitalistic persistent and continuous explotation of the pokemon name which made the name synonymous with childrens toys
the pokemon legacy was ruined by this exploitation and the videgame was largely discredited as a childrens fad
but before the tv show the toys the trading cards etcthe game stood pure and unspoilt by the impending pokemoncraze which was about to accompany it
everybody loved the game
pokemon was reveredin the game you play as ash whose one single ambition is to become the greatest pokemon trainer in the world
to do so you must collect pokemon and train them in battle
to catch pokemon you need to engage in combat with wild pokemon wild animals
you choose which of your pokemon is suitable for the fight and deminish the wild pokemons strengh little by little untill it becomes weak enough to be captured
once caught the wild pokemon will become loyal and obedient
theres no set in stone rule when it comes to catching pokemon if you fancy the look of a pokemon then you capture it
wild pokemon are scattered throughout the game and you can catch them at any timeto complete the game you must collect all eight gym badges
gym badges are given to those who defeat gym owners
gym owners are professional pokemon trainers who are hardened by battle experience and thus much harder to defeat than normal pokemon trainers
it takes a long time to collect the badges because the gyms are sporodically spread throughout the game
between collecting badges and training pokemon you will encounter many rpg elements in the game puzzles dungeons items etc  the game is huge and difficult and can take over  hours to complete
it certainly exceeds the expectations of a game merely designed to kill time on a long coach trip which was what the gb was created for in the first place
taking into account that the gb is a very primitive console the kind of experience pokemon offers exceeds all prior benchmarks in handheld gaming
its an edifying experiencenot only is it the best gb game it is one of the best overall games everthe game came in good condition and works properly
its a great game that has an incredible replay value which i appreciatepokemon blue is a great game
this is the game that first got me totally into pokemon
this game is fun and interesting
you can play this game for a long time
this game doesnt really end
theres always something else to do
in this game you are a guy in crystal they give you a choice
then i actually can quit naming a guy a girls name
who catches raises and battles pokemon which are like animals
pokemon blue is a really fun game
play pokemon blue
youll be totally into pokemon
i really highly recommend pokemon blue and everything else pokemon
pokemon rocksit was great reliving some of my childhood days when playing this game
it actually was kind of challenging trying to remember where to go and how to beat it all over againintro i had pokemon blue ever since it was released but lost my copy ever since
i had the other two us pokemon releases red and yellow and wanted to complete the trilogy again so i searched and found one adequately priced and bought it
luckily no problems with it
plot anyone whos played knows it but for those of you who dont
the plot is simple you the protagonist embark on a quest to get all  gym badges challenge the elite four and become a pokemon master
standard vague rpg storyline
i was able to grasp it when i was  so i assume it shouldnt be too hard to follow
if you manage to get lost you can find an online guide pretty easy nowgameplaygameplay is simple turn based fighting
one person goes at a time
pretty normal for an rpg
players could do team fighters where a max of  pokemon can be used a match the first to ko
all of their opponents pokemon wins
during battle you can attack switch pokemon or use items
run is a forth option if youre grinding away and training
graphicsvery out dated now but was good when the game came outsoundlike the graphics out dated but good for when the game came outoverallif youre a pokemon collector or rebuying a copy like i did to replace a lost one you cant go wrong with itthis game started it all
maybe thats enough to convince you to buy it the fact it is the first pokemon game and you want to see what it was like
if it is not then please read on and learn why to buy itfirst off this was the first english pokemon game
the original pokemon games were in japan pokemon green and pokemon red not the us version
they had different sprites for the pokemon and they were pretty rough
when they came over here pokemon blue had already been released in japan which was a smoother revised version of the first   thats where the name blue came fromthe graphics
 bit
they arent amazing or anything like that but its classic like the first mario
the graphics arent why you play
its fun and original
thats why you play it
the kanto story is basically a trainer who choses from bulbasaur squirtle or charmander and journeys around kanto to become a pokemon master and ends up stopping team rocket in the proccess
after you beat the champion you can try to catch the legendary pokemon mewtwo and the legendary birds if you havnt already done so
you can try to get missingno the infamous glitch pokemon but theres not much to do
as far as replay value goes theres a large amount of it
different things can be done and will greatly alter the outcome of the final battleif you want a nice pretty version of this game then go with fire red or leaf green the remakes
if you want a classic then go with this
also the music is better in this game than the remakesi first played this game when i was in th grade
i instantly fell in love with the simple yet powerfully captivating quest
this along with the n console and age of empires were the heart and soul of my s game experience
pokemon may have evolved over the years but this is well and truly where it all beganone of the biggest time wasters of my child hood
i have not replayed this since i bought it so im not  it holds up to timepokemon blue is a fabulous game with a very original plot and two main objectives
it starts off with you in your house and youre ready to start your adventure with pokemon creatures that you catch and raise
you try to leave town but professor oak a pokemon expert stops you and brings you to his lab
there he has you choose one of three pokemon
this is a very important choice
ill evaluate each one for youbulbasaur a strong grass type pokemon
the first two gym leaders are extremely vulnerable to his type so he is undoubtedly a good choice
he also has a secondary type of poison which can be a helpful feature
i highly recommend him if you are new to this gamesquirtle a very strong water pokemon
he is very good against the first gym leader but not the second
he is my personal choice
squirtle is the moderate choice
hes for either for experienced players who dont want charmander beginner players who dont want bulbasaur or people whos skill is in between easy and experienced
ice moves can also be taught to him which can be an advantagecharmander an exceptionally powerful fire pokemon
he is not very good against the first gym leader and terrible against the second
he seems to be the most popular choice although he is the most difficult to train
he does become the best of the three in final form because he obtains a secondary type of flyingfrom there you must catch more pokemon
you need a party of pokemon you can have up to  and you raise them moving from town to town gaining experience fighting trainers obtaining items and catching new pokemon
the other objective is to catch all the pokemon  in red amp blue
some are easy to catch some difficult and some you must trade from red
you see the only diffrence between red amp blue is the distribution of pokemon  diffrent in each version
some only in red some only in blue
you must use a link cable between two versions
with the link cable you can also battle the other person but you wont gain experience
thats a part of the gamei hope you found this helpful
good luck on your gameits kind of strange how i manged to get into pokemon but heres how it all began one day during a science class a friend of mine and i were going around our elementary school yard and picking up trash and tootsie roll wrappers
the actual goal was as many tootsie roll wrappers we each got that was how many tootsie rolls we would get
anyway i found a stray ponyta pokemon card in one part of the yard and my friend found a dark charmeleon
my friend said ill trade you my dark charmeleon for your ponyta if you want
well personally i didnt want to i wanted to add this card and start a collection but my friends dark charmeleon did look sort of cool at the time
i finally gave in and said well why not
so we traded
a few days later we started acting out some of the episodes at recess id never seen the episodes at the time
my friend was basically making up his own little stories never mind the episodes that were on tv
later on my liking for pokemon grew when my friend decided to bring his game boy color to school and his pokemon red version
i thought to myself hmmm this could be interesting
i asked him what he was playing and if i could watch him play it
he said sure you can watch
i didnt get to see much of the game because we werent outside for recess that long
then i decided i wanted to get my own version of pokemon red
i asked my mom and she said i could
so i did
i got the game almost  years later and i still havent beaten it and i ended up loving it
so in conclusion im eighteen and a half years old a junior at grafton high school and i still love pokemon the games more than the episodes but one thing has changed my friend and i dont do reenactments of our favorite episodes anymore like we used to
i really recommend this gameone word playback
my sister first owned this game in  and since then i have owned many pokeacutemon games for both game boy color and n
and let me tell you the original is always the best
pokeacutemon red and blue are the best games ever created for game boy color
i still love these games trading pokeacutemon and battling other people with the link cablefirst of all people of any age can enjoy this game
it is cute and innocent enough to entertain children but the strategy and the level of gameplay make it a worthwhile game for adults
everyone will love this gameyou start out as a trainer named ash ketchum from pallet town
your mission is to become a pokeacutemon master by catching  pokeacutemon  if you count mew and becoming the champion of the elite four
to do this you must train and catch pokeacutemon raise them and even trade them between red and blue versions using your link cable or the infrared port on your game boy color
this is both fun and timeconsuming which is great when you are at home sick or bored on a stormy day
pokeacutemon are raised by winning battles andor using rare candy
raising pokeacutemon may sound tedious but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself
pokeacutemon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through
you will meet many new people on the way become a hero and win new items and abilities as you go alongas ash you travel through the world of kanto which is divided into a number of cities and towns
a map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of pokeacutemon
explore caves oceans tall grass and rocky paths on your way
each town or city usually has its own pokeacutemon gym with a gym leader which is something like a boss
each time you beat a gym leader you receive a badge
you need eight badges to battle the elite four and the current elite four champion
there are different diversions in each city and town for example celadon citys department store and casino and one of my personal favorites fuschia citys safari zonetrainers can be found everywhere good and bad from team rocket invading the radio station to the gyms in the water on the road and pretty much anywhere you go
random pokeacutemon appear and battle you if you are in a cave tall grass or in the water
the wild pokeacutemon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have pokeacuteballs with you
items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many pokeacutemon if you are trying to get somewhere
if your pokeacutemon are tired or injured you can stop at a pokeacutemon center and heal them for free
you can also store pokeacutemon via a computer terminal located within every pokeacutemon centerthe music is so cute
and there is a lot of different music so it doesnt get repetitiveif you are lucky enough to own pokeacutemon stadium you can play red or blue on your tv screen using a transfer pak
you can also use the pokeacutemon you raised on your red or blue game to battle in pokeacutemon stadiumoverall this is one of the best games i have ever played
it is still fun after years of gameplay as you never fully run out of stuff to do
if you want to get into pokeacutemon or if youre an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game this is the game for you
pokeacutemaniacs rulemy kids and i all love the pokemon gameboys the three of us each have our own gameboy
the red pokemon game is very similar to the blue with the yellow having some slight differencesi like the way the pokemon game  challenges kids
i suggest also buying one of the books which shows the  various routes and places
this allows kids to work at the tasks without  getting frustratedthe idea is to start at prof oaks house get your  first pokemon from him and then journey all around the land of pokemon  collecting various wild pokemon which you catch by battling them until  they faint and doing battle with other trainers along the wayin the  process kids learn to manuever through mazes of increasing complexity  which is why the manuals are a help to gather and use items and to  develop strategies for fighting various types of pokemon
my five yearold  even started to read while using her gameboy from needing to know which  items she had with her in her item listall in all these are great  games which can be played over and over although only one game at a time  can be saved and which will provide your kids with hundreds of hours of  funthanks you i love pokemon games and fun games so big fans pokemon that why i buy them you know thanks you originality  unlike nearly all other rpg franchises this is  originalgraphics  some pokemon look better than othersmusic  the music is very goodreplay value  even if you get through this game in hours you may have more to dopokemon red sold  million in the united states so this qualifies as an underrated game due to selling under  million units
if you want to buy the best game boy game ever this is where you will find it
absolutely no exceptions
this should have gotten a game of the year reward or two but this near perfect masterpiece never got it
a true pokemon fan has this gem in hisher collection
however one thing
some of these might be worn out discolored label multiple scratches on the back etc
due to being so great of a game
dont say i didnt warn youyou love it
i love it
youre probably just getting this because you lost your original or its died out on you
either way you need to buy it and relove it all over againbeyond and above all the hype surrounding the pokemon phenomenon the fact remains that the game at the centre of it all is extremely good fun
think of the final fantasy games but without the boring plot bits and  you have pokemon  an approachable rpg that seems superficially simple  but has a surprising depth of strategy behind it
from the perspective of a  hardcore longtime gamer its heartening to know that something as  popular as this does not require a monster pc with a voodoo indeed it  could easily be converted for the commodore  and the neverending  openended gameplay is a nice homage to elite
the necessity to buy two  copies of the game to complete it and the massive marketing blitz  surrounding the core product is somewhat jading but dont let that detract  from the essential purity of the originalthis game is one of the funest game boy color games ever
 pokemon
wow
thats alot
whos cares about graphics in this gameits still fun
the gameplay and sound is reat as well
if you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to dothen buy firered or leafgreen version
they are just as fun
id reccomend trying at least one of the versions redblueyellowsilvergoldcristelfireredleafgreen or emerald
dont get ruby and saphire tohughthey stinkwhy are you reading this
you all know how amazing the pokemon series are
why be curious
why complain
they are all part of our childhood
theyve been there when technology began enhancing
the pokeball technology made us believe in the greatness of creativity and virtual reality
they taught us about friendship achieving goals patience in gaining more experience to learn better skills conserving our best skills for the blow that fits best
why
why would anyone else rate differentlydude pokemons awesome
stop reading this and buy it
haters can suck on my pokeballs of  pokemon
im a  year old female and proud of playing on my nds battling pixelated characters and collecting them while i am on break in my office
comeatmebroits true that pokemon is pretty much a passing craze due to for some odd reason the invention of too many pokemon
however this game is amazing
the graphics attack animations and sounds are very simple compared to later installments of the series but who cares
at the time this was like nothing anyone had ever played
the music is extremely catchy and there are so many things to collect youll just find yourself playing for hours
also you can trade pokemon from other people since the red and blue versions have pokemon exclusive to that version
also if you feel the need to catch em all trade starters or evolve certain pokemon with a trade
the bottom line its a great guilty pleasure and introduced what is now the most faded franchise everi always preferred blue over red i dont know why really but i just love this game the classic pokemon rpgi got this game right after getting a game boy advanced for christmas
the game is real easy to learn and play
i can see how this game is so addictive for younger kids
the puzzles are fun but not difficult
as an adult it was a fun  way to while away the hours
i played for  hours before beating it
the only problem i had with this game is that there was only one save
it made it impossible for anyone else to play the game
in fact my  year old son erased my first gamethe year was   i was twelve years old in middle school and the pokemon games debuted in the united states for the very first time
a game so simple and yet at the very same time so complex
nothing was more addictive nothing was more fun than playing pokemon
if you remember the craze the real craze presently it isnt nearly as strong as it was back then then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days
suddenly everyone had a gameboy
suddenly even those who didnt normally play games or even know what the hell a gameboy was had it
and youd go up to your friends and youd trade pokemon youd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled
you got in arguments over who the best starter was
then you learned of those glitches to get all your pokemon to level  by duplicating the rare candies
you caught missingno and mblock and caught safari zone pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history
and of course you went to catch them all and you probably had that one friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch em all before he did
if you remember all this youre a true pokemon fan
this isnt a myth this game debuted sold gazillions of copies and started a craze thatwhile it isnt as strongstill exists today
this was one of the heights of gaming periodthe red and blue versions may have seen stateside release in  but the game was actually made in   before the television show came around
when the tv series took off in america the games came next and as i said they sold more copies than the latest installment of harry potter
im not kiddingred and blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today
the game begins with you naming your character you couldnt choose between a boy or a girl in this one and then your rival
again if you had pokemon fever you probably named your main character ash and your rival was named gary even the strategy guides referred to them as such
it began with professor oak letting you have a pokemon of your choice between  starters and then ultimately hed send you on a journey with a pokedex and have you document the pokemon youd find
along the way youd have to deal with team rocket the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyones pokemon as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the elite four and become a pokemon league champion
the entire formula began here and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series pokemon game hereafterwhat was perhaps the strangest thing about pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat
it was your traditional turnbased combat
simple yet it was so complex
for one the game has a rockpaperscissors method to it
every pokemon has a type and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses
for example water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs grass
grass is weak vs fire etc
etc
no pokemon is invincible
they all have a weakness to some type
though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type theyre weak against bug is almost nonexistent and there are hardly any bug type attacksin the battle menu youre given a list of commands
fight item pkmn or run
you can switch pokemon youve caught in and out of battle on the fly but itll usually cost you a turn
its the strategic portion of pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive
as you go through the game youll be challenged by trainers and you never know what theyll throw at you
its completely unpredictable and some of them are tough
its also interesting because with  different pokemon the amount of teams you can make are endless and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster
because most of the pokemon types are weak vs more than just one type
its also important that you give them a variety of moves as the moves are also typed
on paper it doesnt seem like much but when you actually play the game youll find a clog in your drain you didnt even know you had because you thought your team was perfect but then that one pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flawpokemon was no short game
it was full of all sorts of side quests
from the safari zone to catching the legendary birds to the unknown dungeon
there was plenty to do and even after the game was over there was still more to accomplish
of course your main accomplishment was getting them all
pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over  hours
in  this is an amazing feat seeing as how most rpgs of today dont keep you busy that long
the main quest itself only took a measly  hours or so but all the extra content kept you on your toeseven more pokemon was one of the few gameboy games that made excellent use of the link cable
since red and blue versions had different pokemon some only appeared in certain versions
you couldnt for example catch a magmar in the red version but you could in blue
how then were red players supposed to catch all 
by trading
until pokemon came around my link cable was collecting dust
trading was usually a slow grueling process though
traded pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to traineven more exciting than trading however was what really made pokemon a blast to play battling
you and your friends could get together and battle one another
test out your pokemon teams against your friends
they were more often not far better to battle against than the games trainers
its always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is
with your friends it was always interesting
imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job trainingas far as the game looks and sounds it didnt really look all that great when it was released in  it was after all a game made in 
on the original gameboy it was pretty grainy but very clear on the gameboy pocket and of course it was black or white unless you played it on a super gameboy or gameboy color
for a gameboy game though it actually wasnt too bad
it was annoying to watch a pokemon simply flinch to attack and some of the animations werent all that great but it was to be expected due to the gameboys limitations
the music however was fantastic
the tunes were catchyparticularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles
the only really annoying thing was the sound effects
they werent all that great and its a shame that nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in pokemon games today
still for what its worth this was the game you wanted on the gameboypokemon is a classic
itll always be a classic
no matter who you are if you played pokemon ten years ago the craze was completely undeniable
if you got addicted like i did chances are youre still playing today
because in its core the game was far deeper than you thought it was and the series continues to use that same basic formula even todayits a classic whats not to love
i bought this as i already had blue so i could play with my kid brother who is still in this age range and we could trade  i mean i never actually got all the pokemon back in the day since i had no one to trade with cant leave a task undone now can wemy son is really into pokeacutemon and he loves this game
he is into collecting all the pokeacutemon games he can and loves having added this onepokemon blue is amazing
it isnt as good as some of the recent pokemon games but its still a wonderful game
not so heavy on plot your main objective is to catch all  of the pokemon to complete your pokedex and to stop team rocket
catching pokemon is not as easy as it sounds
they will fight hard and almost always break the pokeballs you try to catch them in
it gets addicting after a while though and soon your team is filled with interesting creatures
it is almost like training a pet you can teach them special moves to defeat your opponents and if you use them a lot they will evolvegraphics c the pokemon arent near as cute or detailed as they are in future versions
the blackwhite display isnt so fun eithersound d i have never heard worse scores in my life
it is repetitive dull and will give a headache in less then  minutesstoryline b nice and short
i couldnt ask for anything betterfun a even with minor repetition i still find the game to be a blastoverall the game is  a classic
buy it or you will never be a true gamerstar wars episode i the phantom menace is a awesome movie a classic the best of the best the greatest movie in the world george lucas is a god the greatest film director in the world and the phantom menace video game is just as good buy this game if your a huge star wars fan you wont be sorrythis game is older yes but its a great game and for the cheap price its a must have game
but you need an older computer that runs windows xpthis game is a classic star wars game at first when playing this game i thought it was stupid but then i played it more and found it really quite good the story line is good and i like how you can choose what the characters say sometimesi love the podrace levels with jabba the hut those levels are really fun if you are a star wars fan or enjoy good fun get this gamethis is a very good game
it is so good
you get to play a lot of diffrent characters like obiwan kenobi quigon jinn queen amidala  captian panaka
it woyuld be cool if they let you play jar jar binks but they dont
oh weel
jar jar is one of my favorite characters in the film
the best part is you get to battle darth maul
and it goes along with the movie too
this game rocks
this is a must have game for all star wars fansif you liked this game then check out all of the other star wars gamesive played this game many many times
but unfortunately its one of those games that you will either love or hate which you can tell by the reviews here and i love itthis game is pretty lengthly gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun especially since you get to play the entire movie
i recommend this game to die hard fans but like i said dont be surprised if for some reason you dont like it
some do some dont
simple as thateverything was in good shape when it arrived
it arrived in a timely manner
it completed my set of star wars games for the psone
it went well with my seti bought this game because i played it before on my ps
i know the graphics arent that great but the storyline follows the movie somewhat closelyi am having a blast reminiscing the old timessonic heroes
sonic freaking heroes
gosh i love this game i remember loving it as a kid and i still love it now that im older and playing it again
i like having four different unique teams  and stories to play and the play style is a lot of fun too
you should definitely get this game if you are a fan of sonicwho does not love somesonic
our six year old reallywanted this game and only played it afew times
will pick another game toplay instead
all personal preferencethe kids love it
a d twist to the classic sonic series
some interesting gaming inclusions that often catch you off guardrecommendedi have heard many negative things about this game but i had to try it for myselfi got hooked on it the minute i started playingthe story may be a little sketchy but it is the gameplay that matters the most right
you still get the same high goodlooking jumps and loopdeloopsbut the actual fighting is one of the best partsyou get excellent combo moves and on team dark and sonic a nicely welldone finisher attackall four teams have a finisher attackbut half of them are stupid
what really caught my eye is the two player battle modethere is something about knocking a team off a cliff is entertaining to me
i also agreed with some of the other peopleteam rose is cornyand falling off a cliff is way too easybut over allthis is one of the best and most original games i have ever playedsonic heroes is a lovely platformer
lately i have been hearing people saying terrible things about this game as well as other d sonic platformers
here is my message for them whats wrong with you people
its true that sega hasnt exactly perfected the camera system for this game as well as the other sonic d games but please give sega some credit for this good platformer
to start with the good in this game and there is a lot of it the voice overs are totally sweet
i normally dont pay much attention to the voices of the characters as they little interest me but this game struck a cord there
each voice matches his or her corresponding characters personality species and gender perfectly
there is no question about it
the graphics are good regardless of the very occasional jerky camera and the video clips and the stories are also some of the best i have seen
how each story begins collides with other stories and ends is masterpiece and unlike many other games once you finish a story you can watch all of the movie clips of that story in the options menu
the music totally rocks especially the team themes and the levels all have a good moral lesson for kids that you need to work with others as a team
speaking of team this game is very team oriented the teams areteam rose which consists of amy rose cream the rabbit and as always accompanied by cheese the chao and big the cat
this team has adventures that are beginner difficulty
this is good for young children and getting beginners used to the game
you may also enjoy this teams cutenessteam sonic this consists of sonic the hedgehog miles tails prower and knuckles the echidna
this team has a journey that is a little harder normal difficulty to be exact
this is good for those who want a little more of a challenge and enjoy the light bantering of this somewhat humorous teamteam chaotix the members of this group include espio the chameleon charmy the bee and vector the crocodile who is apparently the head honcho
this teams adventures have been dubbed dubious
the difficulty in my opinion varies from easy to hard
if you like detectives mystery and treasure hunting this team is for you
most of their missions consist of finding a certain amount of something five keys for example
not all of them but most of them
my last comment on them is this is easily the most comical team in the game
i have been set off laughing by a comment from these dudes several times
you should have fun with themteam dark this team has shadow the hedgehog rouge the bat and omega who is an exeggman robot
the mercenaries of this team are shrouded in mystery
first off i must comment that its like a soap opera for children that they brought shadow back from his presumed death and with amnesia included
this team has hard difficulty and often makes you go farther in the levels than you would normally have to with other teams
this group would be extremely boring if it wasnt for rouge
shadow and omega take things very seriously which makes rouges role the person who lightens things up
its an interesting contrast of personalitiesso like i stated earlier i believe it is good for children to see teams of all kinds
this basically teaches them you can team up with others no matter how different they are and work together on a task to make it easier
moving on sega also brings the special stages to d
thats right rather than collecting the emeralds in the storyline like with the sonic adventure series you actually have to collect a key hightail it out of the level without getting hit and complete a special stage in order to get a chaos emerald
oh and true to form the last special stage is once again the hardest
there is also the last story that i will not go into detail here but trust me get all seven chaos emeralds and access it
it is definitely worthwhile
the only flaws i have to list for you is these  because of all of the team action each individual lost something move wise
i am talking about things like knuckles gliding and climbing abilities as well as sonics somersaulting
big no longer fishes like he did in sonic adventure and the flight characters tails cream charmy and rouge cannot fly as long or fast as they originally could
which sadly makes sense seeing as those little things are carrying all of the weight of the rest of their teams
their cool team moves make up for most of the lost abilities but you still have to miss knuckles climbing skills in those tight situations
the flight members each have a special attack that they can do alone but there is little point to them having it seeing as they are almost never alone
so your stuck just doing thundershoot
while powerful i do believe flying characters lack variety in their abilities
the camera doesnt operate  smoothly
it is slightly better than sonic adventure battle and doesnt matter much anyway however
there isnt enough variety in the chaotix missions
its always either find a certain amount of something sneak past someone or get from point a to point b before time runs out
i guess it would be difficult to make it more than that but still the missions lack that investigative thing that detectives do
there is no water to swim in
this isnt exactly a huge problem but i did enjoy confronting and swimming in bodies of water the other games throw at you
here the only water you get is seaside hill and it behaves more like a bottomless pit
it would have been interesting to see how each team adapted to a swimming pool and maybe see what funny thing sonic would have to say
finally the zones are not as expansive
it just puts you on one path and makes you go forward
the advantage with this is that you can never get lost but it loses that go wherever you want to charmthats it
the  player mode is also great for those who are interested and omochao a robotic chao can colorfully guide you through the menus
this game is well thought well planned and well designed
there is even a zone for pinball fans in casinopolis so this game has something for absolutely everyone
get this game
trust me you will get hours of enjoyment from itthis is a very fun game for kids and kidlike adults like me who are kind of nostalgic about the good old days playing sega genesis and nes and watching aosth and sonic satam
this has some old speed and loopdeloops and some new
graphics are ok i expect sonic to be cartoony and i dont understand people who complain about iti really enjoy the teams feature although i tend to abuse the power characters ie
knuckles mr big the cat omega and vector
each team has  members each attributed with either speed power or flight
typically you will be required to use them all in each level
also certain teams are easier to play than others with team rose the easiesthere is a quick breakdown of the teamsteam sonic sonic knuckles and tails
sonic is the speed character knuckles is power and tails is flightteam dark shadow speed rouge flight and omega powerteam chaotix vector power charmy flight and espio speedteam rose amy rose speed cream and cheese flight and mr big poweri was hesitant about buying yet another sonic game
however my grandson absolutely loves this game and honestly i enjoy playing it with him too
it is very entertaininghow can shadow be back
spoiler warningdidnt he die in sonic adventure  battle
spoilers overcan someone please explain to me how is it possible for shadow to be back
thanks to anyone who helps me
ps
i just gave it  stars because i like sonic gameswhen i first got this game my cousins bought that for my birthday i put it in my ps and play it
its like you gather three of your friends and save the world yadayadayadaof course i like shadow for some reason
hes fastand one fact
shadow has rocket boosters so he runs like hes roller skatingthe music goes great especially its main theme
some of the songs i make a midi file of it
im already done with rail canyonabout these ais
their good
especially they were using team sonic after lost jungle zone
good ai
their good seriouslythe graphics were great
word on the street says that voiceovers were poori really like shadows voice in japanese and english seriouslydont question me about the th paragraph okthe special stages were challenging especially getting the chaos emerald
its fun to play it with player
the first one was easy you just had collect links and race to the finish line
it was just the same thing compared to the other sega games which involves sonicteam chaotix is not really my style
team dark is really my style because sometimes i have a destructive mindmetal sonic and hyper shadow are one of these guys you will face in the stages after egg emperor and final fortressmetal sonic and hyper shadow are playable in shadow the hedgehog and i still dont know if you can play as them in this gamegranted it feels all wrong playing sonic with a ps  pad but i know i speak for us all when i say id rather have sega games this way than not at alli have played this game all the way through about  times and it never gets old
its such an entertaining game
if you dont own this game i would highly recommend it
the game shipped quickly and there was virtually no damage to the disk or the boxa very fun game that has to do with teamwork
i dont understand why they didnt make it co op but its still fun playing both single and player modes
its also one of my favorite sonic characters debut
e omega
i still think they should have put mighty in the game i dont know why they had to kick him out when hes a member of the chaotix
and shouldnt knuckles be in team chaotix too
i still think this is better than many of the new sonic titles and although the graphics arent ps amazing theyre good for a ps game
the games good for a sonic fan at any age you dont have to be a hardcore video gamer or a sonic fan to love this game although im both remember old sonic on the megadrive
how it was all about fun and speed and not the exploration and questing that the latter dreamcast sequels seemed to have in abundancewell kids sonic is back and better than ever and now thanks to some extremely brave and very very wellexecuted gameplay changes regains his foothold as the best platform hero in the world bar none granted it feels all wrong playing sonic with a ps  pad but i know i speak for us all when i say id rather have sega games this way than not at allsonic heroes consists of all the usual levels  seaside hill zone casino nite zone etc but its in the teamwork where this game excels
now instead of just playing as one hedgehog or one echidna or one bat or whatever you have to employ teamwork across a cast of three characters per level in order to beat the game
there are  teams so  playable characters in all  and range from staples like team sonic sonic knuckles and tails to past characters rose the bat big the cat and espiosa the purple thing to downright oddball characters charmy the bee for instance
on each team one character is good for speed one for strength and one for flying and you do need to make good use of each character to beat the level youre currently playing
also the teams are graded in terms of difficulty so beginners can start with team rose and work their way up frustrationfreethis adds a huge sense of fun to the game as well as keeping the sonic concept fresh and exciting hedgehogrunsalongflatplane is dulldulldull but for the speed freaks the bonus levels are all about speed and highly reminiscent of the bonus stages from sonic  similarly excellent is the presentation as one would expect from a sega game  there are a wealth of options to be unlocked like new modes of play the fabulous cg movies different voices for the characters etc
 all of which makes for an excellent gaming experiencethoroughly recommended this is another feather in segas cap and one of my personal favourite sonic games to date
enjoythis sonic game is one of my favoritesit rulesthis game sadly only introduces two new charactersand thats omegga and chocholayou can play as sonictailsknucklesamycreamcheesebigomeggashadowrougevectorcharmyespiosuper sonicsolar tails and hypor knuckleseggmanmetal sonicchaosfroggy chochola and a bunch of chaos also appear in the game but you cant play as themthe game has a multiplayer mode witch is alot of funsonic heroes will be extremely awesome
i havent played it yet but i know it will be great and hopefully the bad camera views from the adventure series will be vanishedwhen i say a blast from the past i mean that sonic heroes is one of his old games blown up into d new stages of coursei cant think of anything else to put
just get sonic heroes when it comes out cuz ittl rockfirst off this game is soo not boring it is really fun second off there are no glicthes i have  never had a problem with this game ever and the camera does keep up with you
and third off this game is not hard repeat that sentance ten times i beat it in half a week and got all the bonous stuff and keys and everything i beat it with team sonic team rose team choatix and with team dark witch means it is on hard ps
the one reviewer who said this game gave his kid nightmares how the heck can you get nihgtmares from a sonic game and how can you get so mad you start to cry that really puzzles me the graphics are great tooverall this game is verry goodthis game surpassed my already high expectations
when i first played it i was rather skeptical but it is a very fun game
the levels to do are immense
the characters all have their own unique styles of fighting and the missions are amazingly funteamsill go a little bit in depth about the special teams you can choose from
first up is team sonic which is sonic knuckles and tails
sonic is good for speed knuckles for power and tails for flying
let me just say right now i hate tailss voice
creams and charmys too
just because theyre little kids doesnt mean they need to sound dumb
and how can sonic be 
there is no way
i still think hes at least team chaotix by far my favorite team
i love vector hes so awesome
this team is more or less based on certain missions to do not exactly getting through the stages
you have to find certain things or defeat a certain number of enemies or things like that
this team is for people who want something different
hate charmys voiceteam dark this is a team for more intermediate players
the levels are a bit longer and the puzzles are more confusing
but still its a fun team to be
the voice acting for them are okay i just wish shadow sounded like he did in shadow the hedgehogteam rose hate creams voice
these levels are easier and shorter these are for beginning players and younger players as well
the levels are not hard to figure out nor are they very long
if you want a challenge i suggest trying team chaotix
i adore big but amy is kind of stupid
the way she obsesses over sonic is rather creepy but whateverall in all the game is great
i have been playing it and it is so cool
keep in mind it does get tiresome if you keep dying and have to start from the same checkpoint over and over so be sure to hit the checkpointsby the way espio is a chameleonoverall scoregameplay voice actingknucklesgoodsonicgoodtailshorriblevectorgoodespionicecharmyhorribleamyehhbigokaycreamhorribleshadowehhrougesounds a little like a mane omegalolgraphics overall score this is the best racing game since mario kart
the vehicles are cool and you get to play cool characters and go through cool courses
this is a must have racing gameif you liked this game then check out all of the other star wars gamesof course anyone who owns an n wants an epic star wars game mixed with the sheer speed of mario kart and this game is the baby from both lucasarts and nintendos endeavors
with the expansion pak graphics look well rounded and nice to look at and the track selections throughout the game bring that nostalgic feeling back into the air as you relive your fantasy of being a space cowboy wielding a lightsaber
perfect for any hardcore race fan or star wars geekyou need the expansion pack which isnt that expensive nowadays
if you love racing games than this game is for you
this game is fun and challenging
you go around racing in different planets
plus you can upgrade your vehicle
for the n the graphics are pretty good
you cant really compare it with the newer games
like i said before some tracks are really easy while others ha are hard
i mean really hardthis game is perfect for killing timei am no fan of star wars however this is a really great game that has gotten a bad rap because it came with n systems
first off the graphics cannot be beaten everything is extremely detailed from the textures to the fact that every part of the pod racers moves and shutters
this game offers more than one dozen pod racers and drivers each is unique with unique speeds skills traction breaks and so on each pod racer must be earned though by coming in first for the race where the pod racer is featured
along the way you pick up cash from bets that you come in first second or third then you use this cash to buy better parts to your pod racer and pit droids to quickly repair your racer
this is a highly imaginative game complete with three major circuits and a special circuit in terms of the courses themselves i am a fan of racing games and nothing has ever gotten this amazing jumps that will take your breath away ice caverns that try to trick you anti gravity tubes that will let you fly swamps that will boggle your mind and speeds to boggle your mind too
the difficulty in the races range from circular to near impossible with eruptions of fire and snipers shooting at you from high above
for amazons price you need to get this gamethis is the best game i ever playedi remember playing this game on someone elses n before
so i wanted to buy it for mine
i heard people giving this game a lot of false crap
bragging lies from the pointless haters group that are just in it for the spotlight
i played this game and had lots of fun i even played  player against my friend mark after he tried he said this has become my favorite racing game
oooh
that says a lot too the backslammers of this product
haaathis was a cool game at the time but n  is over and soon xbox  will rule all consoles so get an xbox now and then get  not some lame playstation that will be a copy of the first xboxsony sucks big timethis game is about some sort of boeing aircraft flying around
the models look really nice
try it for ten minuteswhen it comes to fighting games i spend most of my time playing with the street fighter or dead or alive crew but at times i do get fighting time with the smash bros crew
the fighting mechanics are still awesome and function well the environments are still cool the destruciton of your enemies or a friend is still loads of fun
although this game has likely been forgotten since the launch of its gamecube sequel its still a classic that should not be forgotten by any fighting fan
theres still fun stuff to unlock like new characters
the only complaint i have against this game is the fact that it feels too easy at times
still it never gets old to kick the crap out of jigglypuff and send her flying or pikachumost n games are easy to get sick of but this one the fun lasts forever
it is so fun to playthis game is simply amazing you cant disagree it is so fun never repetative because everyday i would invite friends over to my house and we would play for hours and hours
the gameplay is great if your into melee it is similar but it takes a while getting use to the controls of the gamecube
i was a master at this game i loves it so much a character i recommend that all beginners should use would be fox he is the easiest to use but he is also very good if you can use him right
jigglypuff and ness are not for beginners but metronome might be the strongest move in the game
this is a fantastic game unlock characters set new records for your vs matches because every match you have goes down into the record column
this is a must have for n whether you are  or 
remember though play with friends not by yourselfthis game may be old but its still pretty amazing
you can never go wrong with ssb so stop reading this and buy the game
just wish they werent  bucksvery fun to play as your favorite characters
i still like from this game how tight the gameplay is and how each character feels unique
i think in previous incarnations they have gotten a bit of this back but this game i truely felt different playing kirby than i did dkthis was one of my first video games i playedits addeticing great graphics for a nintendo  gameall the charaters have diffrent moves and abilitestheres all kind of wepons and poko ballsi have the ps and ps and i still play this gameand do u no whybecause this game is so funif you see this game around immediatly purchase it on the spot
this game can provide hours and hours of multiplayer fun
 player is boring but better than playing multiplayer by lonesome there a alot of unlockable characters that are pretty cool here tehy are captain falcon from fzero series ness from the rare earthbound series jigglypuff from pokemon luigi from the mario bros series and if you have a gameshark there are cool codes the allow you to be the boss of the smash bros titles master hand and you could also be metal mario with a gameshark
cool huh
have fun and train
this isnt one of those titles you can just rent and enjoy you gotta own it for it to be funthe n had its share of ups and downs but when it hit up boy does it hit it
this is the ultimate party game
invite some friends over order a pizza and watch the mayhem unfold
the controls and graphics have aged well with the colors remaining bright and colorful and the moves still being easy to pull offthe one downside is that the single player mode hasnt aged as well
unlocking the four hidden characters is pretty simplistic though its hard to fault a ish year old game for that
this is a fantastic buy for anyone who wants to start up their collection of n games or for anyone looking for a great party experiencegrowing up as a super smash brothers fan i played this game with my brother and sister for hours on end
it is so fun and the gameplay is simple too
even though this game is older the graphics are still really really good
in my opinion this is a must have classic because of its huge impact on the gaming community
anyone who played this growing up knows how special this game is
and it really isthis game is hilarious
the deal
you play as stuffed animals shaped like nintendo stars or i should really say is quotbeanie babyquot and knock the living stuffing out of each other
with little violence and powerful comedy this game should surplus  stars id give this one  stars at least and by far
this game is meant for fun and not violence
fun beatemup game play and team matches makes this game hilarious
sadly i wanted to see pit quotkid icarusquot in this game maybe in the third installment of this game
support me and go to nintendos web site and ask ask ask
pretty soon theyll come with the third game and quotdaibiyesso daibiyequot fight on
fight oni bought a used version of this cartridge after seeing my year old son being hooked with it during a visit to my sistersyou have  characters to choose from with  additional hidden characters you can release after succeeding in various playing modes at specific difficulty levels
each character has its own set of special moves sounds and tauntsthe purpose of the game is to use your character skills and moves to knock off your opponent from the hovering playing field
damage to you or to your opponent builds up as you hit himher
some punches or moves give more damage than others and as the damaged builds up the character turns more vulnerable to being knocked offthere are a few moves that only give damage and other moves are used to specifically knock off your opponent
this means that you cannot just push buttons at random it requires a lot of patience and some reflexes to defeat your adversary consistentlythe game is extremely simple to learn yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master
you will definitely require all those special moves when playing the most advanced levels or when facing more skilled human opponentsi kind of sticked with mario when playing for me it is the most wellrounded character although im sure  that some of the hidden characters are quite versatile as welli found out that this game can be handicap adjusted making it fun and fair for all ages and skill levelsthis game is definitely more fun in a multiplayer scenario but it is also extremely fun using the computer as an opponent
you can play a freeforall match everyone against everyone with up to  computer or human controlled characters having each one the same or their own unique skill levels
there is also a teambattle where you team up with a computer or a human to face another humancomputer teamone small thing i did noticed was some slow control response in some instances especially when playing the harder levels it requires a little patience getting used to itthis game is very easy to learn extremely addictive colorful fun challenging and funny
it has dozens of playing options and many cool sounds
it is quite entertaining with lots of clean fun for the whole family stars and  recommendedthis game is the best
the only thing i didnt like about this game is that the graphics were not the best
if youre a first time n buyer get this game
its really fun and pretty competitive
it is even better when you have friends to play withthis has to be one of the best games i have ever played
the whole concept of nintendo characters pounding other nintendo characters into oblivion is interesting and very fun
the comical and chaotic feeling of running around and bashing other players of the field in multyplayer fun
you play as one of twelve characters four of which must be unlocked
the basic characters are all easy to play with and relatively popular
they are as follows kirby kirby mario mario link zelda samus aran super metroid donkey kong donkey kong fox mccloud star fox pikachu pokemon yoshi mario
most of these should be familiar to the moderate gamer with the exception of samus a popular gb character with metroid
there are many items in this game that you can collect to boost progress
you can get a light saber type thing making an adequate weapon for plasy
you can also get a fire flower mario bros pokeball pokemon and ray gun star fox
you can also get a star man making you invincible and a hammer letting you smash other opponents out of the matchthe damage and knock out works like this with each attack landed on an opponent their damage percentage goes up
the higher the percentage the farther and faster each player will fly after each hit
players can fall off the edge of the map or fly too high and fall into the horizon
in single player mode you fight computer controlled characters on many different stages
you earn points based on how well you do ie how fast you defeat all the enemies and what you do ie using the same move the whole stage
eventually you can fight the master hand boss of the last stage
once you beat him you have the opportinity to unlock hidden characters luigi mario jigglypuffpokemon nessearthbound and captain falconfzero racing
you also try for the highest scoremultiplayer can be more fun
you basically go through a skirmish against  to  other players whether controlled by the computer or a human
the items will apply and you can turn them on or off by playing  multiplayer games and unlocking the item switch
after you end the time limit with more points than all other players  if everyone else is out of lives you get ranked st nd rd or th and the stats of the game are sent into the game stats bank which you can look overyou can also practice some of the stages of the game trying for the best time
if you persist in this you can unlock luigi
it is always good to get practiceoverall this game deserves a more than five stars
it is very fun and it provides endless entertainmentmany well known and some not so well knownclassic nintendo characters fight it out hereimagine mario against linkis that possiblehere it is you can even throw in a pikachuthe combat system is easy enough and each character has a blend of moves and tauntssome characters are good for close rang while others are good at middle groundthe levels branch off from the characters own worldslike link would have a castle roof top to fight onyoshi would have a little story book zone and so oncolors can be changed for the outfits so you can tell whos who if you play as the same character as oneanotherthe weapons span out from each of the characters franchises with a mario fire flower and so oni cant believe how exspensive this is this is truly a must haveall of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the nintendo world
this awesome fighting game is like mario and mortal kombat together
the great thing is that theres no real violence at all
mario can perfect his fireball move fox mccloud can shoot his laser link can throw boomerangs and bombs while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers
all characters have different special attacks
they can all punch and kick but they all throw smash pound pummle blast and burn diffrently
also items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents
pokeballs which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things swords hammers maximum tomatoes and fireflowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field
with an awesome multiplayer option this is a sure nintendo classic
try this game youll fall in love with it fasti look forward to playing
all the saves work great no trouble at all
the sticker was torn but i just took it off and printed out a new onesuper smash bros for the nintendo  is one of the best games ever made
it includes  characters from different nintendo games
you can chosoe to play with mario luigi link ness kirby samus jigglypuff and pikachu
the graphics are great and the animations flow smoothly as you playthere are hidden characters and a large variety of arenas from many different nintendo games to battle in
there are several aweosme modes to play in including battle mode training mode and even a bonus mode
in addition there are several items you can pick up to fight your opponents an to help restore your health
there are swords fire flowers lasers a magic star wand red and green shells tomatoes to restore damage percentage a super baseball bat and explosive barrels
there are also falling snorlaxs giant pokemon that fall out of the sky and try to land on youi highly recommend this game to any nintendo  owner
if you own a gamecube look for super smash bros meleesuper smash brothers i remember reading in a magazine about this game and thinking quotfinally a game thats going to be a smashquot
a year or so later when i played it for the first time my hopes were confirmed
this title is one if the best if not the best fighting and party game for the n
not being much of a mortal kombat fan because of the blood and gore i was happy to finally see a game that was fun innovating and bloodless
no no finishing moves in this game
super smash brothers is exactly what the name says a smash
with  available nintendo stars to choose from at first and  hidden away to be unlocked later this game is a major intrestgetter
great nintendo stars are avalaible to fight with such as pikachu link kirby donkey kongetc
and keep the game fun and exciting
there is a hidden level to unlock and secret options to uncover guaranteeing that you wont want to put the game down till you have them allas a fun factor and replay value this game definitley rates way over a five
the game supports up to players at once making it a great party game
all you need is some popcorn a couple of sodas and a few pillows and the night is made
you can play with computer controlled characters and also as teams up to three diferent teams at once
the one player game is very fun and challenging too
ssb contains no blood or gore making it a great title for anyone
parents will be happy about that matter because i know how some parents dont apreciate blood gore and guts in a gamethe gameplay rates very high alsogameplay is easy to learn fast and furious
the action keeps you on your toes and you fingers twitching at the controls
the levels and graphics are smooth and cool
sometimes during a player match the game will go into slowmotion for a couple of seconds
some gamers see this as a problem but i think sometimes it adds to the effect of the game
also some elements or weapons are in d making thme seem like paper but this does not detract from the game at all
some levels are cute like the yoshi level and the kirby one while others have a sort of seriousness to them foxs and link are examples
all the levels have some sort of hazard to them like a plane coming and shooting lasers at you or  a tree blowing you off the screen adding to the fun and challenge rate
but no matter what level you play on the graphics a cleanvery crisp and the levels are very funthis title is really great for a bunch of friends or just for yourself and is definitley a game that even parents can learn to play
so that makes it in a way a great way to spend time with your kids too
for the kids this is a great title for new or experienced gamers
this game is worth every penny of what you spend on ita party bash a rainy day you shouldnt stall  its great for all
  from an owner and gamer andrew h kingif you own the n then you must have this game
the graphics are a bit out dated but who cares
the game is still great
even though there are less characters than the newer smash bros this game still brings in the punches
you can play storyone player mode and also play up to  peoplein one player mode you can either do the story mode or do the challenges
both are fun
you can set up the difficulties and also set up how many lives you can usemultiplayer mode is also fun
you have the ability to play in teams or not
still you can set up the difficulties
plus you can have a time battle or set up how many lives you can usethough unlike mele you cant plat story mode with  players but that shouldnt be the reason for not getting this gamethis game was fantastic when it came out
as a kid nothing made me more excited than seeing all of my nintendo characters in one game fighting it out
this game shined the most multiplayer where you could play against  other people
the only problem with getting this game now is that there are sequels out there that are far superior to this one with even more characters
if your feeling nostalgic then get this gamethis game is awsomepurelyawsome
i has an ok  player made but the multiplayer is just outstanding
this is a great party game you just cant stop playing
personally dk fox kirby are my favoritesbtwif you set the damage in multiplayer to  then hit players  times using dks b spcieal move your opponent will fly
and i mean fly
 my friends hate this move
 also foxs b special move you can reflect all moves and attacks
and kirby can suck players abilities and fall on them with his b special move like a brick
you have to buy this game
it is the best everthis game is excellent
you can fight all of your favorite nintendo characters together and have a good time
there is no blood gore or cursing in the game and that is what separates this game for all other fighting games
one reason i dont buy a lot of fighting games is the blood and gore
i think everyone will have a good time except those people that think games are only good when there is blood and gore
read some of the other reviews and youll see what i mean
there are so many good things about this game that  words isnt enough
i will tell you the cons instead of wasting time and words
cons hard to get secret characters not enough pokemon characters more characters should be in it such as turok princess peach zelda wario bowser diddy kong dixie kong charmander mewtwo bomberman goemon yae ebisumaru sasuke impact james bond and others
better weapons are needed because some of them are lame the fan and shells for exampleother than that the game is great and you definitely should buy itsuper smash bros is one of the first games i bought for the nintendo  and i was not disappointedthe levels are great although they are limited the characters are all obviously awesome and the gameplay is solidalthough super smash bros melee is obviously bettermore stagesmore charactersmore movescharacters easier to unlockbetter levelsbetter graphicsetcit is still one of my favorite gamesthe controls are pretty solidthe cpus are challenging and its still excitingi say get this game youll be glad you didif youre not already a big smash bros fan youll become onesuper smash bros is an incredible game
the graphics are nice and simple the controls are great
this game may not be the best n game but its definitly in the top  you can chose all your favorite nintendo characters and they all have unique moves
you start of with  characters but when you accomplish certain things you get new characters like luigi and captain falcon
super smash bros appeals to any ageim  and this is one of my favorite gamesthere are a good selection of stages with a lot of varietythe object of the game is not to kill the other person but to knok him of the stage far enouph that he wont be able to jump back to the stagethe game has  dificulty levels very easy easy normal hard and very hard
which makes the game more chalenging as you get betterthere are also  mimi games or bonus stages you can play without having to play a i player game
each character has  different bonus stagesthe part where the game really eccels is the multi player mode which is so incredibly fun
there is no game that equls super smash brothers as a multiplayer gameoverall this is a great game and a must in every n game librarieits awesome the way you fight and if you get enough wins you get nessthe best character ever
ness is from the ultrarare super nintendo gameearthbound
i actually own both while i am writing this i am listening to earthbound music
it rules all combat games
now clash emthis is a great game one of the best for the system
its certainly innovative when it comes to fighting games
theres no button mashing or crazy combos in this game just simple b a and control stick combos
in a way this is good its not as complicated and easy to get started
but its also bad theres a limited number of movesalso some characters are really useless
jigglypuff
one pokemon was enough but this is even a crapified version of kirby
which takes me to number two
kirby
i like the character an the developers had teh right idea but hes too strong
playing against akirby gets really cheapim sure some of you know what i mean
his brick can protect him from about anythingtheres only  stagesa few of which are really bad like kirbys and the pokemon ones not too great either
but theres good ones also like hyrule fox mario and the donkey
then theres the nostalgic onesthis game is great especially because of its small learning curve and awesome replay valuethe best next to goldeneye
definitely worth your moneyit was more expensive than the used console i bought but i didnt mind the price just because of how fantastic it is to be able to play this againenter the fray with your favorite character well if like me you have two or more favorite characters you know what to do and prove to your opponents they can be human or cpu who rules
super smash bros for the  is one worthful piece that reflects how so far the multiplayer action can go and so continued on the gamecube and wii i own all three
with easy gameplay good bgm endless multiplayer battle great feedback when using rumble pak some characters info obviously not as much as on the gc or wii tons of fun and also that this game left the necessary for its successors ssb is worthy to own
if you still dont have this jewel hurry up and find it
you  owners should have it
consider four goodworking controllers and rumble paksbut the only bad thing
as all ssb games youll feel bored after twenty multiplayer battles just to say sth well but thats no problem
the action continuesi remember playing this with my cousin when i was little and while i have played both the others this is still a great game to go back to
this is a must ownthis one started it all so it is the most popular
it has great graphics for the  and the sound is amazing
i loved all of the super smash bros series and to this day these r my favorites for each system
it has a great multiplayer game and the stages r very creative
the only bad thing about the game is that there r only  charecters and not that many stages but remember this is the first one
if u look at the front it looks like a kiddie game but thats what all of the nintindo games looked like back then
the graphics r so good that sometimes u cant tell this on and the melle games apartmy son is going to do this reviwei am  years oldmy name is andrew
all i can say is wow
this is the best    or  player game of all you can choose up to  people and  hiden people and they are jigglypuff cfalcon luigi and ness
and the people from the start are
kirby my favorite yoshi my other favorite zelda samus mario dk pikachu and fox
it is the best game i own
each person has different powers
but all of them have  b attack up b attack  down b attack a attack smash attacks a block a throw attack oh and punches and kicks and a bunch of other combos
and all of them are different
well luigis and marios are sort of a like
and lots of battle arenas
and you can copy some ones b attack if you are kirby
my favorite person to play with is kirby he may be a little cute pink cuddly puff ball  oh and i like yoshi at first i hated yoshi but then i used him and he was prety darn good
my little brother likes samus
i like every body but my favorites are yoshi and kirby
and if you think this looks like a little kid game you are wrong
it is packed with punches and kicks
oh and i want a game cube because they have super smash brothers melee but it is to much 
oh and super smash bros melee has a bunch of new people to choose and different battle arenas and a lot better graphics
and lots of new stuff
so you had better buy this game
it is the best game vever
it is one big smash
trust me you are going to like it
so get out there and buy this super awsom  game
it rocksa very exciting and fun fighting game super smash bros is definentally worthy of my approval
in this great multiplayer game you fight opponents using awesome moves and killer items
there are also a variety of levels each containing their own special dangers
the object of the game is to knock your opponent off the edge of the thing you are fighting on
it could range from a spaceship in the stareness of space to the tops of skyscraperseach fighter has their own special moves and abilities to crush other fighters with
their moves are not hard to learn so you can get pretty good at the game in a relitively short timealso super smash bros doesnt get boring after you beat it
ive had the game for about three four years and i still love it
and if you get this awesome multiplayer combat game hopefully you will toosuper smash brothers was one of the last installments to the now dead n gaming line
a perfect ending if you ask me
this ist your average mortal kombat or tekken game
you dont have limited health you arent crammed up in a tiny little space and the computer player dosent always win
you can run around on vast terrains where items such as light sabers samus aron or star fox i dont know pokeballs pokemon hammersthe original donkey kong arcade and lasers star fox fall from the sky and are at whoever grabs them firsts disposal
the levels aremario brothers flying island thingie zeldas castle saffaron city star foxs ship samus aarons neardestructed planet donkey kongs jungle yosies island and kirbys planet
theres also a hidden level the mario brothers classic arcade world
and now the playersmario yoshi kirby star fox samus aron donkey kong link andpikachu
and there a  bonus characters and ill tell ya how to get themjigglypuffall you have to do is beat the game on any mode no matter how many lives you losecaptain falconbeat the whole game on any challenge level in under  minutesnessbeat the game on normal with only  lives without getting any game oversluigigo to pratice and beat everyones except the bonus characters bonus game  luigi is faster and stronger than mariohave funi convinced my cousin to rent this game back when it first came out because we were crazy about pokemon and i loved the commercial for itwhen we first played it it was hard
the controls were hard and there were too many moves to remember
but once you get around the learning curve which only took a day or  the game is a great ridethe thing about the game is that it has everybodys favorite nintendo characters in one game
it doesnt even skip on the moves
you can throw links boomerang samus arans morphing ball bombs marios fireballs jigglypuffs sing and many other characters moves
the graphics for the game were excellent at the time and still look better than any n game except mario not only do you have every characters special moves is that almost everybody has their own level and music from their game
you can fight on a pokemon center the great fox brinstar depths or in dreamland to name a few levels
the only characters that dont have their own level or share one with another character are ness captain falcon jigglypuff and luigi
it also has weapons from each characters game
the boombs ray guns poke balls hammers and others
if you dont like items then you can turn them off which is another cool featureanother thing about the game is that you have to unlock half of it
you have to beat the game with everyone which makes you appreciate each characters strength and weaknesses
yoshi doesnt have a triple jump so you have to play to that weakness while kirby has about  jumps which a strength
you have to learn to take advantage of your enemies weaknesses
if you see samus charging up be ready to reflect it back with foxthe best thing about this game is that you have to unlock half the things yourself
you have to unlock characters and levels
it is fun especially since the singleplayer is great funwhat do you do after you unlock everything
play multiplayer mode of course which is the best part of the game
you and up to  friends or ai duke it out in a freeforall
dont like playing by yourself you can set it to teams with up to  teamsred green or blue and fight that way
you can play by lives or by a time limit
youll never get tired of this game and be popping it in every so often for years to comeif youre into pretty colors and flashy graphics and care much less about actually having controller inputs match character actions go ahead and get ssbmelee instead
its got a general random feel to it and skill isnt as important as luck and drooling mindlessly over the images on the screenhowever if you prefer to buy a fighting game becauseits a fighting game and not pathetic eyecandy the original ssb is godly
the controls are extremely precise and its possible to execute combos to near perfection
indeed combos are key to this game something most players seem not to understand
melee seems to have been created to eliminate combos and reduce fighting to random hacking and buttonmashing this is perfectly suited to mentally deficient monkeys but humans with brains might prefer something that takes a little bit of skill
the only problem with ssb is that the combos can become degenerate and certain characters are simply not viable but most players dont seem good enough to take advantage of this almost no one thinks jigglypuff is anything more than a pathetic waste of a spot for instance so enjoythis was one of my most anticpated games of all time for the n and this game really lives up to the hype i had
this is one of the finest piece of fighting game ive played on the n
its even more cool how all of the best nintendo trademark characters battle it out such as samusmariolinkfoxdk captain falcon and more
this game had some really impressive graphics on the n and once again shocked me at how incredible the graphics for n are
the action is fast pace and never looses its touch and cause me to play hours and hours of none stop story mode and just plain fighting it out with friends or bots
the game is incredible and should be played by all nintendo fans
i found this to be far superior then most fighting games but ssbm was better then this but hey this one is a classic
it features some awesome levels and great handicapped matches
its cool how you can also set up any match you
you can also try to beat time records in story mode so you can get new secret characters like captain falcon
the game was very impressive and this is why i gave it the score it got
classicgraphicsman the graphics are just amazing
really great visuals almost all the games i review i give the visuals good reviews but hey i cant help itok
man the graphics for the characters are so cool
i loved the character desighn for samus especially
fox and mario looked awesome too
it ranks up with the other great n titles like zelda
this is truly not to be missedgameplay is fun filled fighting action
none stop action and fast paces moves make this an action packed thrill ride of none stop ass kicking and youll do even better if you get kirby who is the best
no matter how bad you think the game is you have to admit the gameplay is action packed and is nothing but nonstop fun
the gameplay in this game is just worth getting the game
ewww samus never looked so goodblahthe sound is cutting edge punches shooting and wellfightingeheheh you can here yoshi flying in the air from miles away and it is so detailed i think nintendo worked very hard on this title
the sound is above average i know its lame that i review sound but oh well who careswell like i said the sound is above average and is very very very detailed
earns a starwellfrom impressive visuals to great nonstop action filled fun with some really great nintendo characters like samus and mario to very detailed sound
and lets not forget about the pretty intence story mode which you can beat time records to unlock hidden characters
this game will take hours hell probably months till you get bored of this title but i still play it once and awhile but over all with that saidthis impressive title truly earns its out of  starslike i saidvery impressive gamelatesi dont care if you are  years old or  years old put this game on and pick up a controller and youll be playing for hours
i bought this copy for my cousin who recently replaced the system that his parents sold years ago
he couldnt have been happier
i still like this one better than the gamecube and wii versions because its simplersuper smash brosbefore it there were fighting games like street fighter mortal kombat and virtua fighter
their rules were a bit similar and every fighting game was like thatuntil smash bros came alongsuper smash bros reinvented the rules of fighting games combining platforming with fighting moves such as punching kicking etc
whats even more of a nobrainer is how several nintendo franchises crossed over to star in this one game
each character has their own abilities such as mario throwing fireballs and fox using his laser gunthere are a variety of stages to choose from and most of them have their own gimmicks
the mushroom kingdom unlcokable has pipes you can go into and pokemon stadium lets you open a door that certain pokemon pop out of and attackthe player mode is a series of battles like how fighting games usually are
unfortunately the rosters of the battles dont changehowever overall youll get a huge kick out of this game especially when it comes to playing multiplayer
 players duking it outwhat more can you ask for
well besides brawl and meleewow
this game is so cool
a fighting game with  great nintendo characters
they are  starfoxmy favemario donkey kongyoshi samuspikachukirby and link
and dont forget the  other characters that you have to unlock
they are jigglypuff luigi captain falcon and ness
with fighting games you usually think that there is going to be blood and gore and stuff but thats not the case herethis game can be played by all agesit basically just has cartoon violence in it nothing majorthe characters have different attacks and can use all sorts of items
it has great replay value and can be played with up to  peoplewhile it may take a while to master this game is great and is reccomended to anyone
also if you liked this then youll really like super smash bros melee for gcn
trust mei had this game when i was a little kid so i already knew it was awesome
i love iti had recently bought this game a month back and i enjoyed it on my nlater after deleting the earlier data i played through the game and unlocked jiggly puff
the next time i tried it was captain falcon
after that it was no one because i made a mistake
later i went online to this link and it helped me get everything
its very true info
theres even a new level mushroom kingdom classic
i hope it helps you edit here i was nice enough to post everything for youcheat there are two ways to to do this you must pick mario as your character and you must go to hyrule castle as a stage you can fight any opponent you want
at hyrule castle get your chosen opponent to the top wooden platform and then push him or her off of the platform on the left side
then spawn as many green shells as you can on the right side of the platform
from here go to the middle platform and go to the edge of the left side facing left
do marios up  b move  if done correctly your opponents percentage will go up to 
then simply wait a second and knock your opponent off the screen

you will never get tired of it
ive had it for  days now and ive been playing it night and day

captain falconawesome at attacking and a little fastb buttonfalcon punchnessi havent unlocked him yet buy itthe game works perfectly and there hasnt been and problems with it so far and overall its a really fun game one of the best nintendo  games in my opinionthis is one of the best battle games ever made
 in my opinion my friends and i used to play this all the time when we were younger and we were having a party and thought it would be a lot of fun to play again
the only problem was none of us could find our copy so i got a new onethe game that started the smash franchiseif you still ownplay on an n this game is a must haveendless hours of smashing your friends this game never gets oldssb is a game where you take all the classic nintendo characters and battle them out in arenas
and this is an awesome fighting game
this game is very addictive and fun
the one player mode is easy and good for little kids
i really recommend this gamea nintendo classic and one of the greatest games everpros arrived quickly reliable seller really fun game to play considering the characters fights and story perfect mix of epic game characters in one gamecons nonethis is one of the greatest games of all timei highly recommend it for anyone who has an n
break the targets and board the platforms can be pretty tough with characters like nesdont have an n
then buy one to play this gamefinal rating have you ever wondered who would win in a fight mario or jigglypuff
if link went up to face donkey kong would he stand a chance
in super smash bros the creators of the game take all of your favorite well known nintendo characters and throw them into one game
you can choose from several characters like mario luigi pikachu link kirby and many more to battle against each other until there is only one left standingits a great game to play with your friends and see who is the best super smash bros player there is
whether your favorite player to choose from is samus aran or fox mccloud each player has his or her own special abilities that can help you and your character win the fightthere are many pros to this game that include the vast amount of entertainment it provides with exciting items that appear randomly during battle to keep players interested
you can find poke balls to throw at other opponents or swords and bats you can use to hit other people
its a really fun game to play with people your own age and its what i think to be one of the more entertaining games on the nintendo the only cons i can really say about this game are that the creators didnt include enough of our beloved nintendo characters
even though they had most of them i would have enjoyed seeing just a few more of my favorite nintendo characters battle to the deathoverall i rate this game a  out of  for its creativity entertainment good use of graphics and the sound qualitythis is a great game to buy for people who have been using nintendo for years and those who are new to the license
smash brothers is a fighting  game where nintendo characters mario yoshi starfox pikachu samus  kirby and more duke it out
there are four hidden characters a few hidden  features and a hidden arena to be unlocked after a ton of gameplay
the  sound is good and the graphics are good also
a fun game to both play and  watchthis is the best fighting game ive ever played and best for multiple players
there are  regular characters plus  secret ones each with over a dozen different moves
there are  regular battle arenas themed after the  characters and  secret one
starting with three basic moves and playing with another novice you can master all of the characters and all of their moves
this game is unfortunately rigidly divided by skill and good players will consistently beat worse ones
i recommend this for everyone especially those who enjoy games that require quick descisionsthe best game for n
super smash bros is the best fighting game for four friends
cant go wrong with this onewhen racing games were dominated by real simulation gran turismo i just couldnt enjoy first two gran turismo games except the fact that i do get to drive my car
that chemistry wasnt just there
when i picked up this gem i was immediately sucked into it
the graphic was better than first two gran turismo games and not to mention its story line
its simple story but they have managed to present the simple story with special cutscenes with jazzy music and believe me this combination really adds alot to this gamethis game does offer variety with two types of racing and four racing team
not only each team offers various difficulty but also it offers different storylines
i have especially enjoyed night setting race course with music which it brings out the essence of each course to its max
may be somethings wrong with me for i just couldnt enjoy awesome gran turismo games third installment was very enjoyableyou might say but this game was much more enjoyable than gran turismo dont miss itridge racer type  is fantastic
the graphics are top notch
the soundtrack to this game is fantastic with selectable music before each  race
the girl in the fmv at the begining is even pretty hot
lets face  it the ridge racer is the origonal and still king of the playstation race  games
gran turismo is just plain too complex to be any fun
you have to  play gran turismo for hours before getting any good at it
ridge racer is  just pick up and play  try it outand i say true ridge racer because i actually like rage racer slightly better than this
r is the first rr game to have analog support but what really makes this game is the excellent track design
unlike rage racer and gran turismo you dont earn money to upgrade your cars you just unlock cars
thats its only flaw in my bookthose who are complaining about the quality of the graphicsdrive fasteri have several racing games including the best of all racers those on dreamcast f test drive le mans and sega rally 
i also have the quotlicensesgalorequot gran turismo  on psx and sega gt
simply put i have much more fun playing r than the quotlicensesgalorequot simulation racers and place r on the replayability level of sega rally  my favorite of allr is an arcade racer so people who prefer sim games or who gtgtthinkltlt they do may not like it
however as a car nut myself with all these racing games sometimes having less realism and more fantastic cars is the best gaming medicine
r has much variety creative fantasy cars and an actual personality its refreshing to drive a jetpowered racer or how bout that winnable speed mph ft econocar
r offers a story for each of four different race managers you can work with
like the different storylines in a street fighter game this adds a dose of personality though you wont mistake these stories for awardwinning novellasr is highly recommended to all
it can be quotwonquot by those with lesser skill on the quoteasierquot teams but even seasoned racers such as myself get a challenge from at least  out of the  teams the expertlevel drcteam grand prix
also note that one can finish a grand prix with a few rd or nd place finishes but those who do this and think quotim donequot will never see the better cars in the game
and definitely not the pacman carbuy and enjoyi bought this color teal because i liked teal very much
other than that this console has improved on its graphics
on games like super mario bros deluxe and pokemon gold and silver the graphics are much better
also there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on
now if you have game boy pocket and regular game boy and youre playing pokemon it doesnt matter which one you will notice that when you walk around in pocket its very blurry
well this fault has ben fixed in gameboy color
its extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you couldnt see before
i also have some regular gameboy games that arent for game boy color and if you play them on gameboy color they show little color but no blurryness
now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game
there are two types there is one that says for gameboy color only which you cant use on the other gameboys
the second type just says that its for gameboy color
those you can play on the regular gameboys
it wont show any color but at least you can play it
there are a couple faults for the gameboy color
one of which is that the console is too small for me i have big fingers so its hard for a grown up kid
a second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the original gameboy the gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous
i played the gameboy pocket for  hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run outi think its because the console takes aaas and they tend to run out fast
the original gameboy lasted me up to  hours
this only lastes me for about  well i can see why because of all the good color and good graphics
so my point is that this color gameboy teal is a good color to get if you like it
the console is worth the money too
it all combines
the color graphics games to make a great systemnintendo has mastered the art of portable gaming and they have always come out with a better and more advanced game boyright now the game boy advanced game boy advanced sp and game boy ds has come out already so youre probably wondering why should i get an old game boy color
well a game boy color is still an excellent product and there are tons of games to choose from
compared to the original game boy or the smaller version of the game boy was it game boy light
this one is greati really like how this game boy color runs for about  hours just off of two doublea batteries
if you want recommendations of game boy games look no further than the classicszelda oracle of time and ages super mario and metroid
another really cool game is pokemon and if youre not into it then you can find many other great varietiesthis game boy color is really reliable and stable
if you dont do anything really careless with it like drop it in the toilet or hit it with a hammer etc it should last you many years
there are many different accessories you can get to enhance your gaming experience alsogame boy color is excellent and if you havent experienced it yet then you should go and try iti never had the chance to own a game boy when they first came out
so i bought one that was used and i am definitely glad that i did
it works fine and looks awesome
i sometimes take it out and play it just to turn heads
its caused many people to exclaim dude is that a game boy
 im often engaged in discussion with people who share their own personal game boy memories and experiences
so much funi love my game  boy
it is awesome
i recomend to get super mario bros dx
and a battery pack so you wont have to waste money on batteries
with itmust i say moreits the classic gbc for old school hand held gaming
its not the latest and greatest but there are plenty of games on here worth playingthis is the origanal gameboy color its not some crappy sp this was amazing due to all the colors on the screen and the size was better than a gamegear for sure
most of the titles are great and take full advantage of the colors  many people say that its not that great only because there is no backlightbut who cares anyone remember the gameboy light
and how did that turn out horrible nintendo did mot want to take another risk like that and they were right backlights and graphics dont make a game consolecough gamegear cough its the games for the console and these games are awesome so if you want dust off your old library of gameboy color games go for it youll be sorry if you dontsome consoles like dreamcast and n are really good but hard to carry around
ether in teh house or ont eh read this console rules
i would like it to maby be a bit smaller like the pockets but other wise its really cool
some of the games you play on the computer well like tomb raider are good but the controls are so confusing
but on the gbcs versiond of the game is really easier to controol and still has all that good stuff
its a really good console
and the atomic purple is the one i have and its really cool
so buy this item
its really goodthis is the best present ive ever gotten
i think it looks so cool now that you can see the games in color instead of black and white its also great that the game boy fits into your pocket so you can take it everywhere with you
i recommend this product to anyone who wants to play video games everywhere not just in your housei got my game boy color for chrsitmas last eyar along with several games
this is by afr the best handheld system availible pricewise
the system ischeaper than teh new game boy advance if you buy it used and the games are cheaper as well
the graphics may not be top notch but dont let that fool you
there many great games including the traditional nintendo games like donkey kong country and mario games sports games liek madden allstar baseball and ronaldo soccer
there is a huge library of games with hudnreds availible
this is way better than the bulky game boy and much lighter and smaller
the only problem with it is the buttons are to close and too small which causes a problem for people with big hands like memust have gamesharry potetr and the socerors stoneallstar baseball donkey kong countrydriverpokemon hey pokemon is gay but the game sure is funzeldagreat for anybody
the size of the body makes it good for big and small hands
would recommend to new and vets to gaminglove my gameboy colori used to have a game boy color back in elementary school but had since sold it
i recently came into possession of pokemon blue version and needed an old handheld to play it on
there really is no comparison to be drawn between handhelds of the s and handhelds of today
s wins every timeon this gbc you can play any gbc game you want which would be a good thing dont you think
also if you interested in in what goes on inside the game color then make sure you get the atomic purple gbci would say the gameboy color was the best hand held game system i ever owned or play
something that you grew up using will stick to you forever
i still play my gameboy evey now and then playing games that never get old like pokemon
the only thing i ever had bad to say about the gameboy color was that it does not have a back light and i have to use a worm light
if you ever owned a gameboy in your life its something that you always keep with you or end up buying another one like meokay if you asked me now id say go with gameboy advanced
however the price is right on gameboy color and it is still certainly still one of the best handheld systems
i had a lot of fun with the pokemon games and also talking to gameboy for several hours a day
hell make a fine companion to anyone living alone in the cold depths of endless solitude
 stars definatelyit takes me back when i was a kid i used to play pokemon all day i like the color of the gameboy color it rocksok ill admit it i have a gameboy of my own
something mother of two and i got one for myself so that i could play with my kids
theyre great
we are all great pokemon fans which is how we got sucked into the whole  gameboy thing and those are still our favorite gamesthe only drawback  that i find with the thing is that it does need to be wellilluminated  otherwise youll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen
but  that aside these babies are fun
my kids love them i love mine great fun  all around
go for itiam a  year old female gamer
i have had one of these for about  year and a half and absolutely love  it
in the summer of i bought pokemon stadium for n because i had just taken an interest
i did not know you needed the gameboy gamespretty stupid of meeh
so we bought me a kiwi colored gameboy colortoo bad they had no berry colorbut kiwi is just as pretty
along with iti gotmy first gamepokemon yellow
and boy was it more than i expected
i played it hours on end
i could not put it down
i took it everywherein the carresterantsgrandparentsetc etc etc
it really spiced upmy summer
i kept on sticking to pokemon games but soon i discovered more great games such as zelda and harvest moon plus tins of others
i even think i enjoy it more than any other console i ownme and my brother practicly own all the systemsgamecubepsdreamcastnetcetc
the batteries last a good  hours or so toowhich is great for traveling
yesthe gameboy advance may be out there tooand i bought one of thosebut i almost think that i enjoy this more
i think gameboy color games seem to be more addicting and there are a lot more out at the presenti think the gameboy color is cooler looking than the gba
another great feature is that you can plug headphones in so you can play with sound without disturbing other people
i have recently broke my poor kiwi gameboy by accidently dropping it on the floorwelli guess we must get another one
just make sure not to drop it because the lcd screen can get messed up
i would recommend this to anybody wholoves video game and for any age
this will be fun for yers to comeif you want to have fun on the go you have to get game boy color
i had the old gray one before this and this is a major improvement
the colors add alot of life to the games and its backwards compatible so you can play all the old games
the size is really convienient and the dandelion color is the best
buy this system and pick up game boy camera with it tooi got this game system for christmas and it is awesome
the graphics really depending on the game though are great and the colors go well together not clashing on screen or distracting you from hours of entertainment
a tip though to get the best color and graphics on screen tilt the game boy clockwise or counterclockwise
i recommend you buy it it is leaps and bounds ahead of the traditional game boy and the same size as the game boy pocketowned my first nintendo gameboy color back in  and loved it so much
i passed it on to a nephew and it still worked as of the last time i checked on him in   i miss the gameboy so muchon a flight back from celebration vi in orlando a spotted one of these being played by a couple in the next seat forward and knew i had to get my hands on another one
luckily found a great price for one in great condition here on amazon
next task is to restock on some gbc games at the next con i attend
im happy to have a gameboy againgame boy color is absolutely a musthave if you want a portable video game console
it is great
the things i like about it are that there are many different types of games like action sports racing puzzle adventure and more
i also like the graphics when you are playing the games even though the screen is very small you still get a lot of detail
and i like the fact that the screen is in color
there is even a jack where you can plug in a little light so if you are playing in the dark you can see what you are doing
some of the best games on game boy color are monopoly ken griffey jrs slugfest all star baseball  pokemon pinball and tetris dx
i also like the fact that there is a very wide selection of games to choose from which makes for more variety
overall if you want a good portable video game console game boy color is the one to beat
thank you for reading my review
i hope it helpedthe game boy color is the best portable gaming system around
its made all my  plane trips go by a lot faster and for me that makes it worth the reasonable price
there are hundreds of games out for the game boy color and many more to come
there are games in all genres including adventure arcade fighting racing sports and rpg start your gbc collection with super mario bros deluxe and tetris dx the two classics
its small enough to put in your jacket pocket and the game cartridges are tiny
the only problem is that you cant play it in the dark because it isnt backlit so you have to buy an extra light to attach onto it
but cons aside the game boy color is a great investment for hours of entertainment at least until summer  when the game boy advance comes out which will also play game boy color and game boy games
but until then i recommend the game boy color to kids and adults alikethe gameboy color picture is a pocket
is a pricelessly entertaining handheld for a retro gamer like myself
blast from the pasti had the teal game boy color for the longest time and loved it to peices but i gave it to my cousins so oh well im getting a new game boy color in purple this time either way the game boy color is excellent the double aa bateries in the game boy color can last for the longest time ever trust me on this i know that for a fact that they can really last long my one cousin was playing my game boy color around christmas time about six years ago and we stayed up until  midnight playing totally angelica on the game boy color
if your buying a game boy color you wont be disappointed it exactly like the game boy advance sp only with out the screen light thats the only bad thing is that you have to by a light for itlove gameboys
ive had a gameboy pocket advance and advance sp
i should have bought another sp just because of the backlight
other than not being bright the gameboy color is good
it is a nice size and very durable
i would suggest getting collectible or one with the battery cover
mine was a little dirty but im sure i can clean it off
very nice and love the blue color
it lasts longer on batterys than rechargeable
but i have rechargeable aas so it isnt a problemthe game boy was a gloriously fantastic handheld back in the day
things couldnt have been better for nintendountil  thats when things went up a notch for the game boy line
people dont want light
people dont want thin copies of the systemokay maybe they still wanna fit it in their pockets but what the people were asking foris colorthe game boy color lets you play all of your game boy favorites in random color but it also opens the door into a new colorful library of games
the game boy color has continued the life span of the original system to it also saves batteries as it uses half the amount of batteries the game boy usesi just bought a kiwi colored game boy and it is great
it can play over  games and all in color
nintendo did a brilliant job with this portable video game platform
the graphics for most of the games rock and the sound is loud and clear something that wasnt really great with older game boy modelsa great thing about the game boy is that a lot of the games for n and other consoles can be found for this
this is a good thing for some people that do not want to buy an exspensive console
the controls for the game boy are also very easy
just look at the guide for your game and you will see that their are very little manuavers and they will be easy to usebesides all of those reasons the number one reason the game boy is so popular is because it is portable
now imagine this toy that can play up to  games has suberb graphics and crisp and clear sound can fit right in your pocket
thats rightso i hope you will go out or click for a game boy
they are truly great things to own for a child teen or even an adult
they make great toys and are not that costly
buy and enjoyhappy gamingit brings me back to when i was a kid and lives up to how it was in the sone of the best gme player from the past but still a great system of nintendo ever made
i love itthis is a system for the s as i am sure you know and is very old school
it is a great system for hand held play especially if you are into older gamesmy grandma got me this console when i was around  years old
i remember opening it up for the first time and had no idea how to turn it on and when i figured it out i was so excited
ive had this thing for many many years and it still works great
the only thing thats messed up really is the way the sound works
like if i turn the sound circle thing all the way to the max its less sound then it was at a little before that point
but something i like is it has a headphone jack in it which the gba sp lite does not
im not sure if the original sp did or not but i like using my earphones when i play a game so thats a major plus for me
also i did loose the back at one point but we bought a different back at a flea market and it fit just fine
mine is the purple one and sure its got quite a few scratches dings and dents but i still play it every now and then because its a classic and i loves me some pokemon crystal with the recent release of the bit game boy advance you may think that all game boy color systems are next months yard sale fodder
well thats just dead wrong
the tall smallscreened systems are still being played by nintendo fanseven game boy advance ownersat long last the ps version of duke nukem d
this is the game that duke nukem forever is a sequeal to
dntm is a fun but dated by today standards it does play on the ps but the graphics kind of spazz out when the screen goes red from lighting the gameplay is rather tough even on the easy setting but who cares this is still a fun game to play and once you get used to the controls its even betterduke nukem games are old and repetitive
but you know what
who cares
no matter how old and repetitive duke nukem gets its still awesome
thats due to the fact that duke nukem can make anything and everything look good
hell he can even make taking a dump look awesome
the one thing ive noticed about duke over the years is that he doesnt have and hair on his balls then i realized that hair doesnt grow on steelthis game is awesome
its a must have
this game must have the most color in history
it has many levels just like the original for regular nintendo
plus it hs a few more opotions
it has a challenge mode which is extremely hard a vs mode so you can play your friends and a quotyou vs boo modequot its a very good buy
youll like iti got a secret to tell ya too
there are secret levels in this game that are beyond hard
you have to get over  points in the original mode
if you think about it its not so hard to get that many points
its actually really easywell i highly recommend you buy this album
its a good buy well worth your money and its fundont forget this game is for gbc only
that means game boy colorsuper mario bros dx is da babomb
it has tons of replay value including racing boo keeping a calendar playing super mario bros  japan version  getting your fortune told and more
you can even play as luigi by pressing select at the map screen i love this game
it is compatible with game boy printer and  game link
it is by far the best game boy gamesuper mario bros deluxe was released in  for the game boy color and is essentially a port of one of the best nes games starring mario
normally this idea would have sold millions of copies but nintendo went an extra mile or two
super mario bros deluxe is the original game plus extra content that equaled a must buy title
if you were a game boy color owner you immediately bought this and played the hell out of itthe pros you get the original super mario bros a you vs boo mode where you race against a ghost through some of the game stages a  player vs mode where you and another place race against each other connected via the cable link a challenge mode where for each stage you have to find  red coins a yoshi egg and beat the high score
theres also extra content like the ability to print images from the gb printer sold separately a program that tells you where the yoshi eggs are hidden a built in calendar and a fortune teller programthe cons noneits a must own title back then and a real treat to play nowadays if you still have the game boy color or game boy advance sp
it was cool to bring around the original game with you with the ability to save anywhere but the extra modes and content really made it worth its price
track down a copy because its one game you will never ever get tired of playingif youre older than  you probably heard of super mario with over  games to his name he has tried almost every genre  yes even a shooting game  he is a bestseller  the second best selling game ever  and is the face of video games
so where did his fame come from
a package game for the original nintendo
the problem is to experience on the original system you need to find a nes and you have to hope it still work
and ive never known how legal emulators are
thankfully  nintendo rereleased the game a few times  super mario allstarssnes wii nes classic gba virtual consolewii ds wiiu and super mario bros deluxe gameboy color gba  this might be the best
it kept the original look unlike allstars which might put some disappointed but it is a look that cant be beaten
it add a save feature boo race red coin hunt and even achievements
this is the best singular port of the game
if you want you can also get the nes classic version but this is the best port on a gameboy system
if you had to only get one gameboy color game get pokeacutemon goldsilver or thisnintendo did a nice job of putting an old game on a kinda new system
its the first but not the worsti started playing this game a few months ago and just completed all of it
super mario bros deluxe features not only the  nes original levels but also the japanese version levels that north american players couldnt have before
at that particular time the only other way that anyone could access those levels was to play super mario all stars for the super nesnintendo wii
however the nes japanese levels were finally included on this  game boy color portremake
for those of you history buffs the japanese version of super mario bros was actually named super mario bros   the north american version of smb was completely different and released in  with wart as the main archvillain not bowser
i actually find the japanese version of the levels very satisfying and much more challenging
some unusual effects will happen such as marioluigi jumping off a trampoline and into the air off screen for a couple of seconds entering a negative warp pipe that brings you back several worlds ie instead of going forward or seeing goombas walking in the water levelssuper mario bros deluxe is one of those games that i could never ever quit playing even if i wanted to
so stop reading this already and get this game
sadly super mario bros deluxe isnt currently available for download on the nintendo dsds but it would be very nice if it wasthis game is just like the original super mario bros game for the nintendo
it is super
it is a lot of fun
if you love the super mario bros game for the nintendo and you have a game boy color or game boy advance i suggest buying this game
it is a truly great gamethis game is fun and it looks just like the nes game
in fact the only thing diff
is that you can play mini games and the camera is zoomed in
the game is worth the money big timethis game is great
i heard the news that there is going to be a  bit version of super mario bros but i can tell you already this version is better and more authenticit just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced
the game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on
if you love mario i command you to get this gameyou owe it to yourslef and to mario and luigia perfect i only wish that nintendo hadnt stopped making game boy color games because we could have seen the legend of zeldakid icarusmetroidghosts n goblins and mad max on game boy color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making game boy color gamesits sort of sad if you ask mei remember when i was  years old
this my most favorite thing in the world on nes
now it is back again on game boy color
this time it has ton of extras such as  new levels if you beat the game twice and challenges for each level such as collecting red coins or finding yoshi eggs
you can also race against boo on certain levels
this is a great game
just like the original but with tons of extrasi was a vivid gamer back in the day and mario was always one of my all time favorites
i have long since moved away from the video game scene but now and then i play the classics on the pc
and when i played this version i was amazed at how great it had been revived to the gba
the graphics are the same the gameplay is the same the sound is the same but there is new extras and bonus stuff a pathway to choose multi player ect i have to say this is the best mario bros  game ever
even better then mario all stars snes versioni wasnt alive when the original super mario bros came out but i do faintly remember playing it when i was young and i faintly remember liking it
when i went to target to get a game since pokemon pinball wasnt there i got this game instead
i realized that this game was a better choice than pokemon pinball
first off the graphics are marvelous and proves that gbc is just as good as the nes if not better
another thing good about this game is the new save systemi knew it was new because i had a friend who had the original for the nes
they also installed a new challenge mode which is very tough but later in the game there is a new item in the toy box that gives hints to where all the yoshi eggs are
the toy box has options like fortune telling which can be very amusingand get you five more lives to start with if you get an extremely lucky card and tons of printouts for the game boy printer
you might also want to have a link cable and a friend with this game handy for the vs mode
in this mode you can race your opponent on the special race courses
you can also play this mode in oneplayer with boo as your opponent
there is also a new photo gallery which takes a picture every time you do something new like stomp a new enemy or trade high scores with a friend with the infared sensor
yes i said high scores another new feature
but this is all aside from the main game
the game isnt really too challenging until the last world but i noticed that you can jump higher in this game than any other d mario adventure ive played so far
once you beat the main game you get the star levels which are a little more challenging anyway
and once you get the high score you can get to the lost levels which are extremely hard and the last of them has two bowsers
definetly a great buy because of all the time put into a game like thisfor you mario freaks who want to play the original or those ones who are new to video games and dont have an old nes which sadly are becoming increasingly rarer as time goes on this is a good substitute
it doesnt quite capture the magic many of us old school gamers can remember the first time we saw that screen on our tvs
but the golden age of the video gaming industry has passed and we must continue on
sorry for getting nostalgic but theres still nothing quite as memorable these days as playing the old nes years ago with a lot of friends gathered around
perhaps i romantize that era to much of the video game industry but i have a lot of good memories from that
thats how boys bond and also men  me and my best friends still go and play the n  the latest wrestling game from thq and goldeneye always come in handy
and for those parents who are concerned with some of the more mature elements in gaming these days  dont worry mario doesnt have anything to be concerned aboutanyway this includes some new features like challenges find yoshis egg  red coins and beat a specified high score races with boo a toy box or something along those lines and some trophies
also more intriguing is that that included the japanese smb ii or lost levels for us american and uk folks or gamers i mean
you have to get  points on the original and then luigis head will appear on the gaming menu
its retitled super mario brothers for super players and you have to be one to beat it the difficulty level is so high
it took us a good  years to get the game in original  bit format
one thing about the screen its not big enough to get the entire game inside it so they have mario look up and downall in all a good adaptation
still itd be nice to see the release of more games like this  mainly the first two legend of zelda games on one cart
why dont they do this
perhaps with the release of the two new gb colour zelda games they divided one game into halves and stuck it on the remaining two well see a release of those two classic zelda titles
other than emulation or on the bit theyre unavailable
thats a real travestymike londonno visible damage battery works great and the game plays fine with no technical difficulties
it really is as if its newgreat game
will never forget it playing on the nes and gameboy color
i have probably played world  more than five thousand timeshow does one game make an amazing comeback
do it like mario deluxe didsuper mario bros deluxe is a game boy color version of that game that saved the gaming industry
however theres a bunch of features in this game that make it even betteroriginal  play super mario brosupdates to game luigi is playable by pressing select world map different hud due to lower screen sizechallenge find hidden red coins and yoshi eggs in levels from the original gamevs game race the other player in this multiplayer modeboo unlockable race the ghostluigi unlockable play super mario bros the lost levelsrecords high scoresalbum view unlockable picturestoy box extra stuff to play around withso yeahit sure is an improvementthe original super mario brothers came out about the same time that i was born and i think today its aged better than i have
having not played the game in years i was craving some mario and decided to dust super mario bros deluxe off im glad that i did
i forgot not only how well this game transitions to the small screen but just how many features nintendo managed to cram into the game
there is huge replay value to be had here which comes in the form of an additional full game side challenges and other minigames
while the original super mario bros was pretty challenging the developers have added a save anytime and endless continues to ease the frustration level of the player
the only demerit the game gets from me is the fact that the whole game doesnt fit on the screen so you have to move up and down accordingly which caused me to lose a couple lives because of an enemy that i couldnt originally see on the screen
i dont need to write up anything about the gameplay chances are youve played a sidescrolling mario game at some point of your life
if you havent stop reading this and go play right now
otherwise this game is perfect for those craving a little old school mario brothers actionthis game is the account to the snes version its graphics are way better than the original it even holds alot of secrets ex
get enough points and you can play the lost levels boo race and more
not to mention this game is such a great gift for the little ones it is so easy my little brother whose is  has almost completed the gameits been nearly fifteen years since the plumber wandered into the mushroom kingdom and gaming has never been the same since
when the nes was released in  the game that shipped with the system was the instant classic super mario bros and what better way to kick off the first year of the game boy colors life than with a true mario game
the game boy color game super mario bros deluxe is a pixelbypixel translation of the original nes game with a ton of added features
and because the original super mario bros still holds up extremely well after all these years super mario bros deluxe is an absolutely fantastic game that borders on perfection 
perfection in game boy standards of course
there are many different modes in the game but the main game is the  classic super mario bros  levels of platformhopping gameplay where you must go through the world jumping on enemies and collecting coins making your way to the next castle before time runs out
collect  coins and youve earned a secret life
make sure you jump onaww skip it
youve played this game before
what you havent played are the new modes injected in the game boy color version
the vs mode requires two game boy colors and a linkcable but this game is a whole lot of fun
its a race to the flag pole between mario and luigi and youll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way
very cool use of the original super mario bros engine and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone
super mario bros deluxe also has a challenge mode where youll have to find five red coins and a yoshi egg as well as beat the levels preset score to finish the level completely
this is pretty darn difficult hope you have a lot of patience
when i say pixelperfect i mean it
even though the game boy color screen has less resolution than a standard television the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game from mario to the koopas turtles even the questionmark blocks
granted this reduces the screen visibility somewhat but the developers have added usercontrolled screenscrolling to the mix
if you want to see above or below where youre standing its all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad
all  levels from  to  are patterned after the levels in the nes classic
nothings changed
well thats not exactly true you can now save your game in progress something you could not do in the original
it also remembers which levels youve completed and unlocks secrets based on how many youve finished
so its not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game
secrets
thats right
as you complete certain tasks in the game you open up little hidden trinkets
things like a photo album where you can print out earned pictures on your game boy printer or a toy box where you can make messages and print them out
oh and just because they could the developers stuck in a fortune teller just think mario magic  ball and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge
do they need to be in there
of course not
but theyre cool additions nontheless
super mario bros remains one of my top  favorite games of alltime even though its almost a decade and a half old
super mario bros deluxe is such a perfect translation it makes me wonder if its easy to port nes games to the game boy advance
super mario bros deluxe is the game boy colorspecific game to own hands down and will be the title that hopefully will key a revolution of porting nes games to the handheld system
buy this game
nowsuper mario brothers deluxe is an exact copy of the original nintendo game
all the same graphics levels and even cheats are the same
even if you beat the original game this version has a few things added
theres a mode where you race a friend or the computer a table which has  all the toads that youve unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score gain red coins and find a yoshis egg
there is also a picture  gallery similar to zelda dx
which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game
this game is pure funsuper mario bros for the nes revolutionized video gaming no questions asked
accordingly a rerelease for the game boy color seemed fitting
all  levels from the nes classic are back in all their pixelated glory
the music is left unchanged from the nes as well
plus once you beat the  normal levels you get to play through them again in an expert mode with tougher enemies more common and smaller lifts
beat those and you get  new levels from the japanese version of super mario bros  these are often called quotthe lost levelsquot in america
in addition to these amazing features there is a challenge mode where you must find a hidden yoshi egg  red coins and get a high score
theres even a mode where you have to race to the end of a unique level against boo
lastly the game contains several extras you can print out with your game boy printer which increase in number as you progress through the game
by all means purchase this game if you own a gbc or gbaforget all those d games that are practically carbon copies of one another constantly ripping off the character concepts that street fighter invented
this is the definitive fighting game for the playstationthe graphics will be familiar to anyone whos played street fighter or the alpha series but they do have a newer fresher anime style about them
the large anime drawing of the characters after they win a match is also very cool
they animate very well much better than in marvel vs capcom
the sound effects are also great and the music is excellent
my only minor complaint about the music is that the classic character themes are gone
i preferred the old classic songs to these new ones
but thats not too big of a dealanyone who says this game has no depth simply doesnt have a clue about its system
each character has three different fighting styles each with distinct advantages and disadvantages
some moves and super moves are only available in certain fighting styles
some fighting styles are better for attacking and others are better defense counters and reversalsthe super moves are not as spectacular as a capcom vs title but theyre still excellent in themselves
they are also not insanely powerful unless the character has been trained and leveled up a whole lot
which brings me to my next favorite aspect of this gamethe world tour mode
this was a great addition to street fighter
some say its been ripped off from soul edge or soul caliber but considering how badly other games have ripped off street fighter over the years all the sf clones on the snes and even tekken rips off the characters now i dont think that argument can stand
this mode allows you to choose a character and go on a world tour fighting lots of matches with different stipulations such as super combos only multiple opponents etc
as you do this your character raises levels and gains new abilities perhaps being able to use some abilities that his fighting style would not normally allow
you also gain the ability to change your balance of power making your character lean more toward offense to hit harder or defense to take less damage or remain neutralin fact this game has all sorts of cool extra features to be unlocked as well as secret characters
now there are not many secret characters at all but those that are there are far better than most of the ones in tekken come on nowyou cant seriously hope to compare gon mokujin or even true ogre to shin akuma
the other features include the dramatic battle which lets you fight  on  against the computer at high difficulty the survival mode which lets you see how far you can get as both the difficulty and number of simultaneous opponents increase and the final battle which simply lets you choose any character and fight the last boss so that you dont have to play them all the way through the arcade mode
with all these cool extras plus the fact that the arcade mode actually has a good story behind it this game never runs out of replay value
youre always looking for something new to try or just to pop the game in for a quick playone of the coolest aspects of this game is its characters
there is a huge variety to choose from and each is played differently than the next
at the same time though none of the characters really seem silly or out of place except perhaps rainbow mika  thats a matter of opinion i guessoverall this is the best street fighter game ive ever played and the best fighting game in general that ive ever played
its easily worth  stars perhaps with a half a star removed for not using the classic tunesstreetfighter is a must have for the streetfighter fan everywhereif you had this in the day of ps and your into streetfighter old school you will love this title
come complete with unlockable features and alpha combosstreet fighter alpha  might be the best street fighter out there to date
it has awesome game modes cool levels and best of all its the never ending fun of a d fighter
the graphics are what you would expect froma d fighter a little choppy and an occasional glitch or two or maybe an occasional mergence of fighters but all in all its one of my favorite game out there
ihave been an avis street fighter fan all the way back to the snes version of street fighter  turbo
i would encourage anybody to get street fighter alpha  because its fun and hey its down to  bucks nowstreet alpha  really rocked in the arcades and when they brough it to the homes of millions on the psone it still rocked it looked great and of course how could you forget the many characters you had to choose from
in total i want to say  or 
total characters including hidden characters
a definite up scale from the original street fighter alpha where theres only  or  characters and  of which you couldve easily done without sodom and birdiealso in this one the special moves changed because now you got to chose which set you wanted which was cool for some characters and detrimental to the success of some of the other charactersid still definately get this one because its that good and even so how could you not continue to collect the street fighter series
please
you know you want to so go ahead and get itnow most people will read the title and think he must talking about the game
after all this is the third game in the alpha series
no i called this review that because this is my third copy of alpha  lol
i had the alpha anthology first then i got alpha  max on the psp now i have this
so why get this game
simply put i have an arcade stick and i want to play it with that on my ps
so i had to buy it again in order to do that
this game plays like and dream and looks great
i am impressed at how well the ps handled this game
it looks like the anthology version which i would assume is the best just because the hardward in more advanced
you really cannot tell the difference between the two other than load times existing in this version and not in that one
ima keep this brief if you like street fighter you need to own this
this really needs to be a game capcom puts online
i dont know if there is much of an out cry for it but there should be
its up there to me as one of the all time greats
with capcom vs snk  and other great d games of that era
its fun its bright and viberant its just one of the best sf games ever made periodi owned this game and it was a challenging fun game
modes like the one where you have to beat people using only combos is a true challenge
the game itself is loaded with a lot of characters which is coolwhile eveverybody says street fighter iii the rd strike is there favorite sf game  i do think it should be up there with street fighter ii  iv street fighter alpha  is my favorite street fighter game the alpha series takes place before street fighter ii basically the alpha series as a whole tells the story of akuma killing ryu  kens master  akuma going around  killing people  mbison taking over shadowloo trying to capture ryu for his psycho drive ryu travelling around the world to be the best kens desire for a rematch with ryu
charlie nash  chun li investigating shadowloo  trying to bring bison to justice
sagat after losing to ryu joins shadowloo cammy turning against shadowloo
now i just want to put this little update i want to talk about the other version of street fighter alpha  the japaneese only sega saturn port
the playstation version is very good but this is my opinion this is the best port
when you start out guile evil ryu are already in the game
this version is almost arcade perfect  you dont have to unlock any of the characters
evil ryu being in this game fits for future referance in the later games espically street fighter iv
guile figures into the plot hes going to find charlie who the military think has goneawol chariles fate is different if you play as guile
it does add plot points  connects to sf ii very well
it plays well its perfect for the ascii arcade stick or the regular saturn controller
this is closer to the arcade version it does play better than the playstatin version
you will need a action replay mb ram cart if you choose to get this but this game can be expensive i got mine for  i believe it depends on how big of a street fighter fan you are i mean if you have street fighter alpha  on saturn its a great finish to the series
it is my favorite game in the alpha seriespretty much the entire alpha series is story driven  i cant do the games justice but i do recommend it to street fighter fans or anybody thats serious about getting into fighting games in generalalpha  is the culmination of everything capcom had worked towards with their fighting games
everyone knows capcom has the habit of sticking to similar concepts for several games in a row mega man resident evil etc but in no other case has the last game in a series before a major change been so fulfillingstreet fighter alpha  is in my opinion the best street fighter game available including the recentlyreleased sf hd remix
the gameplay is a blend of the slowpaced and strategic street fighter  and the more varied and frenetic alpha series
air combos alpha counters and flashy finishing moves combine with superior character balancing and deep fighting strategythe main arcade experience can be brutally hard as it would be in the wishes of any street fighter fan
the twoplayer experience is also extremely fun as players new to the alpha series can choose different fighting modes one of which xism is more aligned with classic sf balancing
other modes include aism the alpha standard and vism a mode that enhances a players ability to chain standard and special moves together for lethal damagealpha  introduced an incredible world tour mode enabling players to tour the world if you will fighting various characters under various conditions
these tasks may be as simple as defeating an opponent to as complex as defeating three opponents with only super combo moves whilst your character is low on health
completing these objectives unlock abilities that can be linked to your character such as automatic blocking taking zero damage while blocking infinite guard and more
on top of that characters built up during world tour mode are playable in other many of the other modesthe other gameplay modes include training boss battle survival and more
twoplayer battles can also accommodate multiple player characters in both versus and cooperative ie p and p vs c and c or p and p vs p and p
twoplayer back in the days of ssfturbo was the only way to play but alpha  dramatically increased the available options for single players
these lend towards the games long life as one player can play in various modes ranging from standard arcade style to fighting bosses to survival mode and morein essence street fighter alpha  defines fighting games of the playstation era
it is a smooth balance of speed and strategy
though the graphics are dated by todays standards twodimensional games tend to age gracefully and this game is no exception
street fighter fans owe it to themselves to own a copy of alpha  if not to check a popular franchises history then to own the best street fighter game ever madebut still excellent
highly recommende for th fighter fan who still plays the old ps one
great graphics sound and uberfast gameplaygreat shipping and condition of productand i remember when street fighter ii appeared in arcades someuhwas it  years ago or more
 with cast of incredible  characters and incredible  attack buttons
my cousin had to master all  fighters and asked me which end would u like to see
alpha series brought modernisation and superattack option which you can use when your super meter is upalpha  is the best sequel  and dont download rom for arcade since ps version has several fighters more than arcade versioni know this is age of tekken  and virtua fighter evolution but if you can run ps games buy sfa alpha  has a roster that will take you months to master each character
i havent seen so many street fighter characters  in one game before for the ps and ps
the unique feature of this game is the ism system where you can choose which finisher move you want
the best feature is the world tour which is practically a street fighter rpg why cant the new street fighter games have this
where you level up your character as you win matchesif you are a street fighter die hard fan then this game must be in your collection
as a sfii fan myself i rate this the best compared to even the playstation  versions
it is simply the most playable and the most fun incarnation of the game
do yourself a favor and get this one
you wont regret itto be perfectly frank the microsoft sidewinder is the most underrated  joystick ever made
my previous joystick was a logitech wingman extreme
within six months of purchase the wingman was falling apart  calibration  was nonexistent and the rubber case was disintegratingso i bought the  microsoft sidewinder pro
and what a fantastic joystick it was  its  excellent for flightspace simulators like iwar or xwing alliance
the  precision of this joystick is amazingso if youre looking for a  highquality joystick at a reasonable price get this one
its still one  of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the marketthis joystick is great for all kinds of games particularly flight sims
i love its rudder controls
all you have to do is twist the stick left or right
it has tons of buttons all fully programmable
if you want to buy a  joystick definetly purchase this one dont get the force feedback that  stick is just plain annoyingim not a great fun of microsoft but i have to admit that they did a great job with this joystick just for once
i bought the saitek cyborg d
same price
it was horrible
unstable
it was cool looking but whats the use a  cool joystick when you cant land your plane with it because it sends  random signals to your pc
sidewinder is precise and reliable
also its  multipurpose
i use it for falcon  and need for speed and its great with  bothi have flown regularly for almost  years on airwarrior  using the same stick nonusb model
it works as well as it did on day  the microsoft site has an updated win control panel for programming the stick fast free and easy download painlessly
it is bulletproofafter i oiled up the joystick it was much more responsive afterward
the controller worked well when i got it but now it works even betterover the years there has been many video game systems starting from the atari in the early s to the playstation  in the early s
each one has a unique controller
the early ones such as nes and super nes are awkward
same with the playstation playstation  and the dreamcast
but when we come to the nintendo  controller we find something completely different
the designers seem to have gotten the shape just right so that your hands can fit comfortably in the best position to play games with each button placed at the most convenient places so you dont have to reach for them
and unlike the old controllers your hands arent cramped so the only pain you feel is if youre playing mario party without the glovesand black is just a cool coloralas my controller has been the victim of my frustrations so i would need a new oneit was as described and as well as clean great product
ive been playing with it for a few weeks now and it feels nostalgic to be using a like new controllerthis is the best used controller i have bought in my hunt
the stick worked great as well as all the buttons
i am very happy with this
thank you so muchcontroller was much needed after tossing it on the floor a few times lol it is still working so it was a good buythe seller i bought it from sold it to me with brandnew conditions but what else can i say its a black controller that suits me welljust as difficult as i rememberthis is one of the great games to have ever come out
it is not enough to even call it a true classic
its not only an absolute top quality puzzlestyle game but it has a great story unique and original characters and settings and beautiful graphics
and just the originality of that beautiful new world mythology and fantastic concepts make this game a cut above the restwhy is it great
its a real puzzle game
not that theres always one solution or a right or wrong way to do things but it is a game that focuses on technique creative thinking finesse and sometimes quick reflexes
there is no life bar the game doesnt focus on that or combat it focuses on simply being able to figure out a solution and being able to execute it
and its fun not boring and repetitive but also very challenging
and you have unlimited lives which makes for playing with friends a lot of fun as you can pass around the controller to see who has the best ideas and skills
it is as much fun to watch as it is to playone of the original concepts behind the game was that the main character was supposed to be nonviolent but that isnt entirely the case as there is violence of a sort
the main character just isnt directly violent
but this is one of the highlights of the game not a detraction as i and most gamers would normally consider it to be
you cant just plow your way through levels you have to think watch time your actions and adapt to the challenges
but when you do get those few opportunities to just gun your way through a level it only makes it that much more funand the game is tight
the controls are very well done
you can easily master the fast maneuvers to coordinate with the necessary actions and specific spacing needed
youll get frustrated in some hard areas but you will be able to play fast and risky just kind of show off or you can play slow and cautious
its all up to you and if you want to take your time and get through it with as few attempts as possible or if you want to just try to fly through an area and risk killing yourself a lot
sometimes luck favors the braveand the game environment is solid
a very well done andor tested
i dont recall ever finding anything that was glitchyif you like quality puzzlefocused games that have straightforward challenges the game doesnt scale or do anything cheap to mess with you  try to make the game more challenging and enjoy a good storyline with great humor that doesnt take away from the game you really should check out abe in oddworld abes oddysee and oddworld abes exoddus
it is a really great game that is nothing but quality
this is definitely one of those rare games worth owning and replayingoh boy whats not to love about this game
its an instant classicin oddworld you play a slave called abe who works at the meatprocessing plant rupture farms
abes a mudokon hardly your typical cute platform hero but a gangly orangeeyed greenskinned creature with a samurais tuft of hair and the posture of an ape
the storys premise is that the factorys owners have found a tasty new treat to whip into production since they ran their last dish into extinction
the problem is its you
or more precisely the mudokons
when an eavesdropping abe finds this out he starts hamstepping stage left right quick proving that curiosity can save the cat too
your goal as abe is to escape rupture farms liberating as many fellow mudokons as possible and find a way to bring down the entire plant
but playing a christ figure isnt as easy as wed all like to think
using a limited vocabulary set abe must convince the mudokons to follow him to safety all the while racing through the factory flipping switches avoiding obstacles evading heavily armed guards and staying alivegive me more we need more games like this onea fun and extremely weird game
if i remember it right you had to get pretty far in the game before you were able to save but the fact that you can die as many times as you want made up for thatits good that you can die a lot because you will die a lot
anything and everything kills abe in one shot
great gameplay and a really funny storyi remember playing this game in my teens still as fun now as it was for me back then
thank youthank you so much i havent played this game for a very long time and havent been able to find it anywhere until i came across your site sooo thank you very muchafter  or so inaccurate reviews i have this to say  epic superman has awesome graphics gameplay voiceacting and its flight engine  something alot people dont seem to understand so they bash the game well you see  people like me and mah boi superman can actually fly therefore we can accurately review epic superman
this game also has multiplayer which is nearly as good as black ops
if only there were online play  i have to say this is an accurate simulation of flight and the best game on a nintendo console
everthis needs to be remade on the current systems
this game alone is reason enough to invest in a nintendo  gaming system
the controls are amazing and the gameplay is addictivethis game is so much fun you get to fly through rings then try to stop a car from hitting a business man but you never can its greati had this on the sega cd rom and i think that this is one of the best games ever released
if you havent played it get it and if you have then get it again
althought the story line in lunar  is better the actually game play is a lot more fun in this one
if you are looking for an rpg to play then this is definetly one that you should tryoriginally released on the sega cd the developers thought that there could be some enhancements
so it ended up here and although graphically it looks like it came from the sega cd era the other enhancements and not to mention the great story and characters is more than enough to get this
just good luck finding it since it was in such demand working designs stopped making them and made it incredibly rare to findthe story starts off in the town of burg where the hero alex dreams of becoming like his hero dragonmaster dyne who died under mysterious circumstances
then the hero searches for the white dragon to become like his hero and from there he ends up in a battle for the entire land of lunar
it seems like a straightforward story with plot twists youll probably see a mile away but the way that its executed is so masterfultheres some much needed humor in the game involving some pop culture references such as when a traveller tells nalla flying cat how much licks does it take to get the the center of a tootsie pop when it was an owl in the commercialthe music isnt incredibly memorable but it adds life and great background to each location and event the music is featured
the voice acting is amazing some great voices
the one thing that feels odd to me is the voice of alex ashley angel is a member of the boyband otown
although it isnt the most baddest thing in the world it feels odddont expect mindblowing visuals
these look quite old but they dont retract from the gameplay
the anime scenes though are incredibly beautiful that range from simple character intros to big plot points
the animation seems so colorful and vibrant rather than looking a little too quotadultquot
even has some cg elements like lunas song on the boat or something further in the game im not spoiling for youif you can find it or borrow off somebody play this immediately and experience the world of lunarim one of the ten or so people who actually bought a sega cd and like many if not all i believe this was the best rpg for that otherwise disappointing system
lunar silver star story complete brings me back to the good ol days of rpgs before the likes of final fantasy vii and viii were called the best rpgs ever by newbie gamers who just dont know any better
the story was flawless and breathtaking then and yet somehow it all seems better this time around
what makes lunar lunar though is the fact that working designs was behind it
they can translate even the lamest games and make them playable i even bought shining wisdom for my saturn just because of working designs
the people at working designs are a bunch of comedians
there are so many jokes in this game its unbelievable second only to final fantasy ix in humor
the game has received an upgrade in every single way most notably the graphics
yes the graphics arent an important part of any game but its nice to see that they got an uplift this time around
back to the story though
everything about the story is perfect its beautiful its touching and its one of the best in any game i have ever seen
i could go into more detailbut you should really play it for yourself
what surprised me about playing lunar again was the length of the game
its pretty long
while not as long as its sequel it still offers days of fun like i had with the original version
the characters themselves are great
typical of their rpg times
yes but great nonetheless
especially alex and nall who i just loved
the difficulty of the game is very applaudable as well
not incredibly difficult but its not easy either and thats just another reason why i love this game so much
the one thing that didnt stand the test of time was the battles
theyre very straightforward and basic nothing to it at all
its just taptaptap
boring indeed
thankfully the random number of battles isnt frequent
the packaging also needs mention
lunarsssc comes with a nice box that contains a  page leatherette hardbound artbookinstruction manual a making of lunar cd a music cd and a fullcolor cloth map
who loves ya
working designs
unfortunately newschool gamers might be put off by lunars oldschool look and feel continuously asking quotwheres bahamut zeroquot this is unfortunate because it looks like lunar might go back to the cult status it had on the sega cd instead of selling by the truckloads like it deserves
oh welldefinitely their loss
nevertheless this is a masterpiece
lunarsssc should be as mandatory as the controller for psx owners
truly one of the best rpgs of all timehey you know the drill if youre a gamer you owe it to yourself to buy this
oh yes dont forget to pick up the sequel as welli had just started playing rpgs when i picked this one up it was probably my third or fourth rpg that i played
i absolutely fell in love with this game the moment it started
i never played the orignal or second on the sega cdstoryline what can i say its your typical boy loves girl girl gets kidnapped and boy saves world and girl
fortunately rpgs are great not because of the story but how the story is told and working designs did a brilliant job in the storytelling
they took the story and put a few twists here and there but not to the extreme or completely insane they left it a simple story and made it an epic masterpiece
lastly this game has one of the most memorable villians in an rpg to date
ghaleon is a great villian who has a great background story that unfolds extremely well during the game and in my eyes he ranks right up there with sephirothcombat system for whatever reasons working designs left it simple and turn based and keeping to the sprites instead of trying to make the fights d with games like ffvii legaia and others going d this gave a lot of ridicule to the game itself a very unfortunate thing too
it was nice for the characters to have only certain things they could do like alex could only use special sword attack and no magic as where jessica could only use magic
it kept the fighting more tactical and also made everyone in the group important and not just a space fillergraphics working designs kept to the sprites and kept it looking a  bit rpg
they did do something to keep the story moving along with anime clips wonderfully done by the way which they used to introduce characters and to help the storytellingmusic the battle music gets repetitive and so does the traveling music as i think they couldve done a better job in that department
the voice acting was done really well but the womens voices do get a bit high pitched at times and it happens to the guys on occasionthe characters were developed nicely each having their own background story which adds to your liking and caring about each of your character in your party
you can easily put  hours in the game and also there are whats called bromides to collect
bromides are anime pictures in the game which you can collect throughout your travelsi believe there are  in allextras disc i watched it and enjoyed the voice actors and developers talking about how much fun they had making the game and what they did to add what they thought would help the game outthis game despite its oldschool graphics and traditional fighting system gets a  out of  for its wonderful story and loveable characterslunar silver star story complete is the best remake ever
blows away the original in every possible aspect from graphics to story one of the best d graphics ever everything is crisp and detailed with great anime sequence new soundtrack is great the only song boat blow me awayone of the best cast of characters ever a great story reworked a great improvment over the original no random battle the battle are pretty difficult  specially the boss battle voice acting is good new extras great package the gamplay is on the simple side again a little sidequestsnow my classification of the first lunar versionslunar silver star story complete ps  masterpiece lunar silver star harmony psp  downgraded version of the playstation masterpiecelunar the silver star sega cd  good but very obsolete overshadowed by silver star storylunar legend gba  pure garbageim a little late in reviews since i played its gba remake lunar legend first
i luckily got this game in trade from my local game express well anyway from the other reviews you know the basicsmusic and soundthis music rocks i especially like the final battle theme go
go
gographicsvery nice since being a playstation game the areas can be more exspansive than the tiny gba thus allowing anime cutscenes and more free roaming through places but the gba is nothing to be scoffed at having better sprites and brighter colorsstorylinevery good stroyline im kinda surprised since i usually hate love stories the story is as soild as this game can get
and unlike some rpgs coughfinalfatasycough you wont get bored and say oh please at a useless plot twist that just makes you lose intrest in the gamewell now lets see if i can test my luck and find lunar  eteranl blue or maybe hopefully theyll just remake it for the gba and call it lunar legend coolest charctertempestfav character all of em especially nash kyle alex jessica and tempestfav music fron game go
go
go
 solitary wolf fighting spirits magical weapon nash its me modern boy and mias theme forgot nameif youve played the original lunar for sega cd i need only say quotbuy this collectors edition nowquot  for those of you who are unfamiliar with lunar its a classic old school rpg with d graphics and turn based battles
there are some differences between the sega cd version and the playstation one though
the graphics and color have recieved a noticable face lift some areas have been edited or cut altogether and a few items have also been left out
the music a prime feature in the sega cd version has been reworked also sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse
another new feature is how you encounter enemies
you no longer are forced into random battlesenemies are now only in dungeons and can be seen by icons and therefore avoided in many cases
overall this a great package even if the price tag is high
the music cd and the documentary disc are nothing monumental but fans will appreciate it
if you have not played lunar before and are a fan of rpgs get this playstation version while its still available and find out why it created a cult following on the sega cdi love this game and series i shortly ordered the nd complete copy as well
it has treated me well with a wonderful story and great characters
i recommend this game and franchise to all my friends and fellow gamersthis is one of the best games ever to come out on a console system
the characters the animes and the simple and easy to learn battle system
there are many anime sequences with dialouge and they are funny
the battle system is a simple turn based combat which can be very amusing
the plot is great but the graphics are old saturn style but still rock
this game is worth your moneyi thoroughly enjoyed this game
the packaging and extras you get with it are very nice
the storyline was extremely well written and it was easy for me to connect with the characters on an emotional level
the music in this game is some of the best i have ever heard for an rpg
definitely a good buyhonestly i miss rpgs like lunar now days most rpgs like the newer final fantasies feature a story that is too complicated and sometimes weird to thoroughly enjoy
lunar keeps in simple by making the story a tried and true good versus evil story and by doing an excellant job on developing the charectors within the game
i guess its simplicity could be the downside for some gamers but i personally enjoy a great old school rpg like lunar from time to timei found the lack of polygons and elaborate battle techniques a blessing in the silver star story
id rather see a realistic cartoon than an annoying jerky d anytime
the music is beautiful and id catch myself humming the opening theme occasionally at work
the anime artwork in some of the scenes is breathtaking and the storyline is engaging
i am looking forward to the sequel which will be coming out around the th of novemberthis is an alltime classic game
i have played more puzzle games than i can count in my head and this game has by far the best puzzles of them all
the graphics sound and interaction of this game are stunning
the way that you have to collect information from every available source to solve a puzzle makes the game extraordinary many puzzle games do not work that wayone aspect of the puzzles in this game that makes it different from many other games is that you cannot guess to solve a puzzle
with many games you can get past a tough point just buy clicking on every item in your inventory until you guess the right one
eventually you guess right and youre on to the next puzzle
in myst you must decipher them the oldfashioned wayi agree with other reviewers however that this game has zero replayability
it should take you long enough though so that you wont feel like you didnt get your moneys worththis is the first pc game i ever bought
with its awesome graphics and compelling story its easy to see why this is the top selling game of alltime
in its time this game and the th guest changed the way gaming was to be
most point and click games you see today are following these  trend setting games but its very hard for them to match up to what these games accomplished
it has some very tough puzzles and about the only lacking was there isnt much going on when you click on an area except for sound which is a key for most of the puzzles you will be solving
if you like point and click games with puzzles to solve this is the game for you
a thoroughly enjoyable game that i have played close to a dozen timesok i have played myst a good bit so i can personally atest to the complexity of this game
i will half to admit that i used the strategy guide a great deal to help me because some parts were just impossible
first of all you half to be extremely knowledgeable before you even attempt to play this game
there are things that i dont even understand and im not dumb
but the most difficult thing is tying together little pieces of the game to figure out one piece of the puzzle
i really like this game and have yet to beat it
the music is haunting almost and makes you feel like you are there walking in a realistic d enviorment surrounded by things that you have no idea what they are but will tie into the game as it progresses
there are also  completly diffrent quotagesquot  myst island the selentic age the stoneship age the mechanical age and the channelwood age
this is a very complex and difficult and i would warn anybody who play it to be ready for a good challengethis game is exellent
however i recommend buying the updated version quotrealmystquot
this version you cant pan around to gage your surroundings
they are both the same game but the graphics in the updated realmyst is a vast improvement over this versionone of the best adventure games ever
shame its for older computers and it makes me miss mine
if the gaming companies ever remake myst for xp id buy it again in a heartbeatreleased back in  myst is a classic game that revolutionized the gaming industry
rand and robyn miller created a new type of game which diverted from the typical mass market and took off into a fascinating and innovative direction
its hailed as a landmark in the industry and praised for both its aesthetics and storyi think that myst is best described as an experience rather than merely a video game
its creators strived to develop a world rich with detail and intrigue with a subtle narrative intertwined into the strange yet beautiful surroundings
as the game begins you are dropped onto the island of myst without very much information to guide you
what immediately strikes you as unique about this experience is that there are no friendly characters to help you on your way no enemies to fight and not a very clear purpose
the game is largely about just exploring your surroundings and experimenting with different devices around the various worlds
this is what makes the game so immersive
the graphics of myst though not quite as extravagant as todays were definitely of high quality
cyan built its d world through an extensive layout of still images and quicktime movies and the end result is simply amazing
navigation is nodebased meaning that you dont necessarily walk through the environment but rather point and click your way through your surroundings
each new section loads as if you really had relocated giving the appearance of movement
making a d world in this manner might seem strange but at the time it was a necessary shortcut to make it possible to run the game on computers without a lot of ram and processor power
even by todays standards i still think the environments look impressiveso what exactly does the gameplay entail
as you explore the island you discover two journals with missing pages each of which belong to atruss sons sirrus and achenar
your main objective is to travel through the different worlds or ages and retrieve the missing pages from each book
as you recover each page you learn more about each brother and you must try to discover who is lying and who is telling the truth
in the end it will be up to you to decide their respective fates
your journey is not easy for you will have to solve rather challenging puzzles in order to progress throughout the worlds
this can often be frustrating for the puzzles solutions are not always intuitive
it will take much patience and observation and perhaps even a little helpthe sounds in this game are mysterious and enchanting
the soundtrack consists of strange sometimes haunting tunes that blend in remarkably well with each respective area
moreover the sounds are integral to the gameplay for some of the puzzles involve listening in addition to seeing
you will need to observe and interpret different sounds and apply that information to the challenges you face
this is yet another way in which you can truly become immersed within the game
the music makes your surroundings feel foreign and believablemyst was groundbreaking for its time and it started an incredible journey that would spark several sequels
its an experience that is visually musically and intellectually stimulating and though the game is a bit dated now i still think its worth playing if you enjoy a good challenge
as many have mentioned the ending is somewhat anticlimactic but at the same time it will most likely make you want to continue the adventure with riventhis game was fantastic
myst was the very first adventure game i played
that was  years ago
ever since i have been hooked on adventure games
myst made me feel like i was actually there
the puzzles were fantasticrewardinguniqueand challenging
play this game with the lights down and the music loud
you will be there
i love myst as i did riven and i cant wait to got back tomyst iiihere way before arrival date
was a gift for my son and he loved it
will order from here againwhats amazing about how great this game iswell its that it does not rely on insane graphics large amounts of memory lightningquick processing speeds or mindblowing soundin fact this game has none of those thingswhat it has is the ability to get right under your skin suck you in and keep you playing
whats eerie is how much you feel like youre in the game when the graphics really arent much to speak of especially compared to todays gamesi played and finished this game back in   i own other game platforms ps etc and i have played many other games since then
none of them is like this onei cant remember if myst was my first pc game
i know it was the one that got me hookedto the point where i kept upgrading computers and peripherals just to keep up with the games
i tried to replay myst a year ago and found i couldnt figure it out have i lost that many brain cells over the years
 didnt have the patience or something to keep at it
but like a first love i remember it very fondly and treasure it
its almost heart breaking to think that some day soon as windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of os newbies wont be able to experience myst
just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rocknroll burst forth
to confess i liked the graphics in riven better
and i never liked artus whatever or his two sonsthought they were all slackers and whiners with serious emotional problems
i loved that you could not die and nothing attacked youreally allowed me to explore and indulge my curiosity
loved the details little bugs that moved atmosphere just everything
sound effects and musicwasnt myst one of the first to put visuals and music together
all in all many good things started with myst
i know it was the first computer game that spent time and money on the graphics something i always appreciated
at most places the game play wasnt strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted
you could spin around and see everything
it was totally mouse driven
one feature i loved but many others complained about was that it was an empty world you never had togot to interact with anyone else in myst for me it was somewhere of my own where i could explore to my hearts content go back and walk around areas that i liked like tree world cant remember its actual name even after you finished that level
it is an all round beautiful gamealthough the technology behind this game is a little dated now this is still an excellent puzzler for those who like games that dont involve shooting monsters
dont get me wrong i enjoy blowing away bad guys as much as anyone else but its nice to play something a little different every once in a while
this game does not depend at all on weapons or killing anything nor does it require you to do a lot of jumping or physically manuvering around obstacles
it is entirely a quotthinkingquot game
the closest you get to physical action is the fact that some of the puzzles to solve are mazesyou start the game stranded alone on the island of myst with no idea how you got there and no idea how to get home
your only clue is a note found on the ground near the islands library
from this slender beginning you learn about the history of the island about altus and his two feuding sons sirrus and achernar and the four mysterious ages you must visit and explore
be sure and explore the library thoroughly
check everything
the books in the library contain important clues
they are not strictly necessary to solve the game but they help out a lot especially the mechanical age with the rocket ship
personally i found the channelwood age the most difficult but all of the ages can be solved with a little logic and thorough exploration
each age is also filled with little trinkets and gadgets that dont really help you solve the game but they reveal a lot about the personalities of sirrus and achernarvisually the game is absolutely gorgeous
each age has an entirely different look and feel to it
the user interface is extremely simple and intuitive
the haunting soundtrack and welldone quicktime animations also add a lot to the overall feel of the gamethe only people you will actually interact with at all in the game are the aforementioned altus sirrus and achernar
this leads me to my one and only complaint about the game
i wish the millers had spent a little more money to hire some better actors to play these roles as all three of them are badly overacted
but thats a minor gripe
altus acting is so bad its actually funnyonce youve played through this game a couple of times it becomes pretty easy
however i still maintain that the game does have a lot of replay value
why
becuase once you have figured everything out and memorized the solutions to all the puzzles you can get to the end in about  or  hours tops
but that  or  hours is time well spent immersed in the games beautiful environmentive noticed several people who have mentioned that the game does not run well on windows   ive encountered this problem too
if you install the game from the automatic installation dialog box that comes up when you insert the myst cd the game will play ok for a little while but will eventually crash
however i was able to find a solution
if youre running windows  or newer do not install from the dialog box
instead go to the install subdirectory on the cd find the quotinstallexequot file there and click on it to install the game that way
the installation procedure is slightly different
youll know you are doing it the different way when the game installes to a new directory called cmyst
if you use the automatic dialog box it will install to a different subdirectory
i installed the game using this alternate procedure and it has been running fine with windows   i hope this helps anyone out there experiencing problems
it would be a shame to miss out on a game as good as this one becuase of operating system problemsmyst is an awesome game of puzzle solving and exploration
whats nice about myst is that it is completely violencefree and peaceful
this is a must havethere are very experiences in this world that are completely original
in terms of adventure pc gaming however myst is utterly without equal and if you are the right kind of person will quickly become one of the most endearing experiences of all your entertainment pastimesbefore myst computer gaming usually was in the form of either firstperson shooters wolfenstein adventures aimed more towards children kings quest and the tons and tons of sharewarepongsimulator games that flooded the market in the earlytomid s
in myst though gamers are simple dropped into an environment where little to no information is given to them thus requiring much exploring and a logical mind to determine not only the overall point of the game but also how all the levers and puzzles work in conjunction with each otherfor a basic plot summary you the stranger suddenly appear in a universe where a man named atrus can pen books that actually spring to life
however many of his worlds are dyingunstable and you must determine the cause
is it atrus himself who has gone mad and imprisoned his sons in his own prison books or are the sons locked away for good reason
the stranger must explore a series of five islands and piece together the mystery one puzzle and logical deduction at a timethis myst series is not for everyone by any means
if you are a bit lacking in patience and want a lot of action this is not the game for you
it can get a bit tedious at times and one has to resist especially nowadays when walkthroughs are available with a few mouse clicks the urge to look up hints all the time as that truly destroys the beauty of the experience so if you want to be blasting baddies or wreaking warhavoc look elsewhere are the risk of severe disappointmentfor those who really appreciate this kind of thinkingpersons game myst is unrivaled and i have tried many of its subsequent clones in the industry because of its riveting storyline
a lot of other games have tried to duplicate the puzzling style of myst but only myst has been able to successfully capture the emotion of compelling characters that never seem to get oldoverall i consider myst to be one of my alltime favorite pc games because of its groundbreaking intuitive style
in hindsight at least two of its sequels surpass this original but myst is always special because it set the groundwork for the master series
if you want your brainwits to be more involved in a pc game than your trigger finger then i strongly recommend myst if you havent tried it to this point
if you can let yourself become immersed in its worlds you will get hookedthis will be short
simply put riven is my all time favorite game
the story is deep
the graphics are excellent
i was fully absorbed
if they could create a game with graphics like these in real time d  could you imagine
its a great gamei hold a deep affection for this game
my brother bought it for playstation on a whim having never either played or heard of myst i still havent played it and i played the game alongside him both of us consulting the walkthrough the whole time something i now do not condone but we were young  what do you expect
 and thoroughly enjoying it
we had hours of fun playing it over and over memorizing the steps the scenes and every instance of the number this game started my love for everything myst related and made me realize that i can play video games too
until seeing this game i thought that all video games required finger dexterity and quick reflexes neither of which do i havesure it may not be the best as far as graphics when compared to newer games and may not have the threedimensionality of subsequent myst games and many newer games but it still holds a magical quality and the storyline cant be beat
this game is a true classic and everyone who plays adventure games should play it
as far as storyline and puzzles go this is what adventure games should bei cant recommend this game enough
you walk away smarterif you like  a game with a lot of action forget it
if you like to feel like you  accomplished something this is the game for youits predecessor myst  was excellent preparation for the type of game this is
there is no  quotactionquot per se just clues and objects to work through
you  dont get killed you dont get points
you do however get an  appreciation for how intricate details can be interlinkedimagine that  you end up in a land where you have to put together the pieces to figure  out what happened
this is both myst and rivenif you play myst  first it will help you understand what this is all about
i recommend it  highly
it will give you a sense of what you are looking for and why
myst was a land where you realized that two brothers had done something and  were trapped in books for their efforts
their father and mother also were  elsewhere and looking for one another and had left clues in this same area
your assignment is to piece together what happened and use your gut feel  on how to act in regards to that
there are in fact  possible endings to  mystin my opinion and from what i have seen at home unless you have a  very analytical child this will not hold their interest
this is an adult  game and not from the perspective that you are protecting the child
i  honestly think this would be an excellent assignment for a child to hone  their thought processes on
however the lack of action and need for real  thinking most children will think of as work not funput on your  thinking caps and dive inim waiting for the next onei tell you this the creators of riven sure did their homework in the four year gap between the original myst and riven
the graphic improved drastically meaning whatever computer you were running the original myst in  myst first appeared on the mac in  then the pc the following year would probably not be adequate to run riven
certainly myst had made even greater improvements in the graphics department since riven like the  degree panning feature for myst iii exile and even more photorealistic graphics and animation for myst iv revelation but even for  standards the graphics to riven still hold up although its rather obvious the graphics looks a little more pixelated during some of the animated scenes like when you take a ride on the cable car probably to keep the animation fast without slowing it down for the computers of the time
but for the most part the graphics seem so realistic you almost feel like youre there
of course the big pain is this game consisted of  cdrom discs which you have to swap every now and then its too bad they didnt have an install feature where you could install all five discs on to hard drive and only need to use one disc to play the game like the much maligned schizm mysterious journey a game from poland thats very much like myst which had five discs in the cdrom version and you had the option for full install so you didnt have to keep swapping discsits agreed by most everyone that riven is more difficult to solve than the original myst
the puzzles often dont seem obvious and there are some puzzles that can be frustrating like the marble puzzle which you have to solve in order to gain access to the domes found on riven
or the animal puzzle which youll find a bunch of stones in this one room with animal symbols that you have to push in the right order to go to another world
on the original myst after you won it atrus tells you that his wife catherine has been taken prisoner and on riven youre supposed to find and free his wife taken prisoner by atrus father gehn
also it looks like a different guy was playing atrus on riven from the original myst in fact it was none other than myst creator rand miller who plays atrus on riven as well as myst iii and iv though i hadnt played myst v so i cant tell you about the game or the characters although im uncertain who played atrus on the original myst
i really love the ambient music that goes with this not to mention the beautiful scenery found throughoutalthough a bit tricky in places youre certain to enjoy this game if youre in to mystthough i didnt think it would be possible without adding real pictures the graphics on riven exceed those of myst
every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye
the sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic
they also have added more animation
you see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game
they have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater
the game play is much the same as myst but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area
you also have to learn the riven math system to solve other puzzles which i thought was a cool idea
ultimately all these things add up to tougher game play but this game is well worth iti just played it in april of  and it stands up over time as the best adventure game ever made
superbplayed it for the first time after it has been out for over ten years
great game
the puzzles are hard but not impossible to solve
if you truly love myst then you will certainly love this game
do not use walkthroughs it ruins the game
also keep in mind that the cd riven set is for outdated computers
it will most likely not run on vista or xp at least not without some major glitches
wish i had played this soonerif you think you are smart enough to finish every computer game in the world in a few days think againriven is the hardest computer game i have ever played
i know someone who got this game and it took him six months to finish it
i myself have not finished it yetif you get this gamei strongly recommend that you should you have got to turn off the lights turn up the sound and youll step into the strange world of riven
its really coolthis game requires tons of brainwork
if you dont think hard youll never finish the gameso i think you should get this game
the story is great the graphics are great hey everything is greatexcellent
sound story line great graphics and challenging puzzles
although i found i had to cheat just a little using the universal hint system on the net
all in all it is well worth the purchasewow i loved myst when it first came out but riven far exceeded my expectations
gorgeous graphics hours of gameplay with mind bending challenging puzzles
a must have for adventure gamers and collectors
a classic to not miss out on
there are hidden clues throughout the game be openminded and try not to go to fast you could miss a hidden path or a clue
your patience and hard thinking will pay offmyst set the stage for dozens and dozens of adventure games and with such an act to follow cyan had a difficult time topping themselves
but  amazingly they didriven picks up exactly where the myst left off
you are in the chanber with atrius and he sends you to riven to try and  trap his father and rescue his wife and the people of the land
unfortunately the moment you arrive in riven you have your trap book taken  from you and embark on an island hopping trip to try and recover it and  confront gehn once and for allthe thing that makes riven so beautiful  is that there are living creatures around you now
you can walk around one  corner and see a frightened group of villagers runing away from you and  hiding you can catch a child peeking out at you from around a corner bugs  crawl on the walls and large sea mammals bask on rocks at the  beachturn the lights off crank the speakers up and play riven  youll find yourself lost in the world of puzzles of frightened natives  politics and everything else
myst was groundbreaking because it was so  unique and riven is likewise because its alive
probably the most alive  game ive ever playedlike the top and first reviewer said this game is not for everyone
it is almost not a game at all
everything is in first person as you are moving around the area talking to the very few people you encounter some nice some not
the visuals are stunning
and the music is just as beautiful
i played many hours at a time and while a lot of the game is crazy difficult dont get me started on the dni numbers it is still a lot of fun
let me repeat the puzzles in this game are hard they are time consuming and they seem not to make sensethis is not for everyone and only for people with a lot of patience and i would say avid computer gamers and avid computer games who can appreciate slow methodical thinking games that do offer entertainment and beautiful graphics and music
there is some violence and character interaction but this is by far no halo resident evil or gears of war
i must say the first time i played i got very far but then got lost and had to buy a game guide
when i went back to it later i could not figure anything out and got nowhere fast you dont care about that but im baffled i was so lost the second time playing
anyway riven is an old game but the graphics hold up
if you can get it cheap go for it
i will say do not be fooled by a lookalike game rhem it is rivenlite and hardly worth your time
i will also say that even if you are so confused you dont understand anything youre doing or what the story is i still think youll be entertaining
it is really a cool game to playi enjoyed riven more than myst
riven was more difficult than myst for me but i still only needed two hints to complete riven
i would highly recommend riven to adventure gamers
it really has set a new standard for the genre
havent played exile yet but i wanted to complete riven before moving on to  what these cyan games possess  far above any other adventure games ive played  are smart subtle story lines that really keep your attention
how refreshing to play a game that respects the players intelligence and sense of inquisitiveness and adventure
i know im hooked when i think about a game throughout my day
riven does become your world
finally like tolkiens the lord of the rings the myst games possess subtle yet compelling christian symbols  a spiritually fulfilling experiencequotrivenquot is a continuation of the popular roleplaying game quotmystquot  i didnt think it could outdo its predecessor as most sequels are never able to quite live up to the original
but quotrivenquot more than met that task
in fact quotrivenquot so surpasses quotmystquot in scope storyline and task that its almost bogglingthe game opens with you returning to dni again after transporting through the linking book in the library on myst island
the everknowledgeable atrus played by rand miller thanks you for coming back and says he needs your help
and from then the race is on you need to find his wife catherine who is trapped in a prison somewhere on the riven age
her captor turns out to be atrus father gehn a madman who wants to destroy his own son
along the way you encounter people puzzles awesome creatures like sunners and wahrks and dazzling special effectsjust like on myst island the clues you discover on the five islands in riven are what reveal the story to you
quotrivenquot is increasingly more complex than quotmystquot in that regard
everything is just bigger and in my opinion better
the graphics have improved tremendously the quicktime videos used for all the animations in the game are improved the puzzles are harder and are more integrated into the storyline than ever before and there is actually character interaction in this game  much more so than simply meeting people through prison books like in quotmystquotquotrivenquot is definitely habitforming
the first time i played it i ended up just walking around and looking at everything before i decided to actually begin my journey on rescuing catherine
when you step out into the open a few minutes after the real action begins the sense of quotthis is gonna be bigger and more immersive than mystquot sets ini cannot say enough positive things about quotrivenquot  i end up playing it more than quotmystquot and have sometimes preferred it over quotmyst iii exilequot  to say i am fascinated with everything on those five islands is an understatement
i sometimes with i could actually go to the riven age and explore thats how seriously disturbed i really amin short if you love the quotmyst phenomenonquot get quotrivenquot  quotrivenquot improves upon pretty much everything that made quotmystquot such an awesome success
let it capture your heart and your imagination like it did minethis is an older game with great graphics and sound but it will not run on windows   it does run on windows xp and older versions of windows
i had this game years ago but the discs were scratched from being used so much so i bought a new set and am enjoying it all over again
however if you purchase this game it is so hard to solve you will probably need to buy the users guidei really loved riven
after playing myst i was so excited to get my hands on riven
the graphics were just as beautiful as myst
in fact in riven i got a little jumpy at times
there are parts of the game where you know you arent alone
the story line was fantastic and the puzzles also
adventure gamers you have got to own this one
infactown them both
you wont regret itthis is by far my favorite out of the myst series
before i knew better i cheated to get to the ending looking at walkthroughs
unfortunately its not like you can undo that memory in your head and ive forever ruined  the game in my eyes
the two biggie puzzles in this game involve clues from the whole game youve explored up to that point
i wish i had taken the time to fully appreciate their solution and not cheati just purchase this game a few weeks ago
it was the first that i played anything related to myst
this is is user friendly unlike other games where you have to fumble over the keyboard controlsbeautiful landscapes  and exciting roller coaster like transports from one island to another  makes this game enjoyable and excitingclever puzzles are disguised as  rivens natural habitatthis is a slow pace game not for those who like  facepaced game
as always this game is fustrating and after a while you  might get tired with itbut the absorbing story line and the  landscapes should will make you forget all that and you might never want  to leave riven even after you completed riven many timesfirst of all i would like to point out that i did not play myst the first game in the series
i at first was afraid that i would be left confused and in the dark but the game explains everything you need to know
what im trying to say is that you dont have to have played myst before riven though i suggest it stronglythe games graphics first of all are impossibly real
everything looks almost like a photograph from the stone cliffs to the iron railings on the stairs to the various transportation rides around the age of riventhe game is a puzzle game it is not easy
it is not the kind of game you will sit down at and simply beat
it took me at least six hours without the strategy guide
just for reference if one goes through the game and does the absolute minimum ie
already knows some of the codes and knows exactly what to do when and where the game will still take about and hour and a halfthe gameplay itself aside from being beautiful and challenging is an extremely easy to use idiot proof interface of click where you want to go
the game is a masterpiece what more can i saypros  graphics that are fantastically detailed intricate and achingly beautiful
some astonishing joy rides
sound effects and music approach perfection
gameplay is wonderfully balanced
you are never bored and only occasionally frustrated by the harder puzzles
all the  puzzles are logical and give you a great feeling of accomplishment when  you solve them
there is a vast area to explore while you are figuring  things out
you turn a corner and startle mysterious creatures who are  sunning themselves on a rock
you climb up another path turn and the  view makes you gasp
riven creates a fantasy world that is alien yet  it evokes a sense of reality that is in my experience unparalleled in  computer gaming
i wish i could find a way to live in rivencons  if you like exploring new worlds by dashing through them and shooting  things you may find that the pace of this particular game is too  slow
while the storyline is intriguing it is possible to nearly  finish riven before discovering the diaries that further explain the plot
i wish i had known more of the background of the story a little sooner in  the game
riven is so immersive that you forget the everyday world
your children will wonder why you havent cooked dinner
your friends will  speculate as to why you have stopped answering the phone
your spouse will  become jealous of your relationship with a computer game easiest solution  play it togetherbottom line  imho this game is it the numero uno  the king
nobodys made one betteri admittedly played myst and was frustrated with it
i was so used to games giving you hintsdirections so you knew where you had to go to progress the story
myst broke that boundary and let you explore a world
i never finished it and only got maybe  through it before i stopped playingwhen riven came out i initially brushed it off harking back to my myst experience
good reviews and in game screenshots of these lavish environments and devices made me want to try it and i was not disappointedriven at the time it was released was the only game where i played the entire night keeping a scratch pad next to my mouse so i could notate things id find designs shapes items even sounds as the guy at ebgames said he recommended to
while still difficult in terms of puzzles and solving them i found it easier to progress the story and move into the different time periodsthere is a part where you need to remember particular sounds and replay them in order so you can proceed
this took me forever
i couldnt get it right even though i thought i remembered it
it truly tests your mind
getting by that particular puzzle was very gratifyingin short if youve played myst or even its sequels after riven give this one a shot
you will not be disappointedi was bored one day and was watching my motherinlaw play ape escape   looked like it was fun and less stressful than some of my other games that i like tend to be and borrowed her copy of the first ape escapeit starts out simple enough
you catch a few slow monkeys and learn your gadgets thru tutorials
but then it gets difficult
my  year old daughter loves to sit on the bed with spare control in hand and help catch monkeys
the graphics are nice and the storyline is fun
the gadgets are cool tooonly one complaint and that is that the camera angle loves to change when you are at the most challenging parts
anytime you need to use your flying thingy and its for going somewhere difficult the camera changes and you cant see where your destination is
it gets a bit annoying after you die a few times but i did eventually get past the frustration and finished the game
this game is great for young kids and adults alikei used to play the h out of this game when i was little and even more when i got older
its one of those game thats old but never got boring even when i played it multiple times
for those who are new to the series you might think its just running up to monkeys and catching them with a net
youre partially right
if you go into this game and try to catch every monkey by just running up to them with your net you will get a game over fast
i own the other  games in the ape escape series and played them multiple times so its safe for me to say that ape escape  is the hardest of the series
let me go into a little more detaila little background im not sure about other consoles at the time but the ps unlike todays sony consoles had a different control scheme
instead of using the analogue sticks to move your camera and control your character you used the arrow buttons
the analogue sticks didnt have much use
actually with some games no use at all
in other games like spyro the dragon you had the option to turn them on but for some of those games it was glitchy
ape escape prooved revolutionary in that it was the first ps game to solely use analogue controls and im happy it did
i think ape escape is the best moving ps game i have ever played due to analogue controls
it makes controlling your character and changing camera angles way easier than most games at the time
now all games use this control scheme for the betterstory summary  boys spike and jake are heading to the professors laboritory to try out his time machine but once they get there they find the professor and his assistantgranddaughter natalie tied up by a horde of monkeys
the monkeys leader spector has gotten hold of one of the professors inventions called the peak point helmet which increases spectors intellegents and helps him achieve an insane level of power
the other monkeys possess monkey helmets that do pretty much the same thing as spectors helmet but less powerful
spctor sends himself and the other monkeys through time so they can change history in a way thatll make monkeys the dominant creatures of the earth and humans basically nonexistant
its up to spike to capture these monkeys including spector
i know its not the deepest story but its really amusing and fun getting to travel through time through the dinosaur age up to the future
later on in the game i actually found it compelling
you also really grow to love spike by the time you finish the game
i understand now why alot of people who play the sequals wish spike was the main character againgameplay elements and monkeys once again you catch monkeys but its easier said than done
the first  levels are pretty easy but by level  you will be introducesd by some of the harder and more hair pulling to catch monkeys in the game
the task of catching the monkeys is made harder by the fact that you have natural level enemies to worry about while chasing the monkeys down like man eating plants and annoying bees
i also have to mention that alot of monkeys are packing heat
laser guns bombs machine gun hollycow
dont get me started on the red pants monkeys later on who carry almost all these weapons as well as have extremely powerful scratch attacks that you can rarely avoid
there are different kinds of monkeys
ill just summarize what they do
monkeys with light blue pants are wimpy and easy to catch
monkeys with dark blue pants are fast little monsters and require patients to get
yellow pants monkeys are the most common and have normal difficulty
green pant monkeys carry missiles on their back and require stealth to get because their sensitive to movement
white pants monkeys sense you easilly and are hard to sneak up on understatement
impossible unless someone says other wise
black pant monkeys carry ooziesmachine guns
i have to note the black pant monkeys are way harder to catch than the ones in the newer games
then you have the abominations called red pant monkeys
good lord do my heart stop when i have to catch one of these little bastards
catching monkeys takes alot of patients and strategy because as youve already guessed from my description of them they are hard to catch
throughout the game you are given multiple inventions from the professor that are essential to catching certain monkeys in earlier levels that couldnt be caught before
every invention is important in some shape or form and will either make a monkey easier to catch or harder depending on the strategy used
the inventions are way better than the ones they give you in the other games
some of the inventions in the other games are just plain useless
you also have lives in this game that you gain by collecting  gold arrows or a jacket
ive had more game overs in this one then any of the other twolevels the levels are divided by eras the whole travel through time element
for example im in the dinosaur era and i play  levels from this era one after the other unlock them catch the required number of monkeys then leave unlocking a new era with  more levels hope that explains it good
each level is unique and different which makes everything feel fresh and that much more awesomemusic omg
ape escape has one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time
not since donkey kong country  have i entered levels just to pause and listen to the music
ape escape prooves music is a very important part of a videogame
the music excites you and is very enjoyable
it has the best track of the entire series and its ashame ape escape  suffers from its bland soundtrack
in ape escape  the music is reminiscent of the first one so i think the makers learned from their mistake
my favorite tracks are crumbling castle dark ruins galaxy monkey the spector theme and a few others but the soundtrack of the whole game is just epic and fills my heart with nostalgia and joy everytime i hear one of them
its underrated and i wish more people knew about itreplayabillity compared to the other games ape escape  doesnt have much replayabilty unless youre like me and love it so much you just start a new game all the time
throughout the levels there are spector coins you pick up
the coins are used to unlock  minigames in the time station
my favorite of these is galaxy monkey
the other two are meh
i really wish they had a way for you to unlock the soundtrack like the other two games
that would have been awesomeive gone down memory lane long enough
the sad part is i still have my old ape escape game but it no longer works anymore
im definately buying it off amazon
i wish instead of porting ape escape to the psp they would have ported it to the ps with an soundtrack unlockable available
given that attention is mostly put on the ps and other next gen consolesgames nowadays i dont see a port happening soon the ps doesnt even play older games according to some people ive asked
ape escape is definately worth buyingheres the premise  youre this little guy with a net and a light sabre running around trying to capture these monkeys
the monkeys wear different colored pants and have little sirens on their heads
the pants tell you how tough they are to catch and the sirens tell you if theyve caught on to the fact that youre trying to capture themin addition to the trusty tools i mentioned above you get a whole slew of other gadgets you can use to capture the monkeys including an rc car slingshot and monkey radar
unfortunately the monkeys are also armed with everything from grenades to machine guns to canonsin addition to being hilarious the commercials for the game were great if you got a chance to seem them on tv the joy of the game is using the analog controllers to move and manipulate gadgetsthe game was the perfect difficulty not too hard as i had suspected it would be
i still havent completely finished and look forward to hours more fun netting those pesky little chimpswhat can be more fun than running around chasing monkeys
the are plenty of levels and gadgets to play with
the only downside is that the paddle boat is impossible to control in my opinion
each monkey has its own charateristics and weapons
just trying to run up and snag the monkey doesnt always work
special gadgets must be used first
pretty much run around the world getting rid of monkeys using gadgets
the game is pretty explanatory but is loads of platform fun
also includes minigames that can kill some time with friendsi love ape escape
it is the best playstration game ever
just look at the other revues if you do not believe me
you need a dual shock controller to play this awesome game
the mini games are really cooli got to admit i know the game is aimed more towards kids but im  and i had a blast with this game
i never even heard of the game til it was shown to me in someones collection
being bored one day i put it in the playstation to check it out and lo and behold i played that game til early the next morning
the object of the game is to catch all the monkeys lose in each level
trust me it isnt as easy as you might think
it takes some smarts to get them lil critters
armed with several different gadgets youre a oneman monkey catching machine
i know it might seem like a silly game to you but its one of the most fun games ive played in a long while
you definitely owe it to yourself to see what its all aboutwhat can i say
you are catching bad monkeys with a net
how can that not be funit starts off not that impressive the first few levels but dont let it fool you
it gets much better
easily my favorite platformer on the psone of the best ps game ever
it is just plain great
definetly get it if all you have is a psthis is a great game
i had it when i was younger
its still better than  and 
buyah the year was  while sony and nintendo were clashing people thought that  would be the end or at least the end of their computers
spongebob squarepants began to reign to over kids along with pokemon
and some people were wondering why their ape escape game wouldnt work as they threw their nondualshock controllers down on the floor while i was hating the game for not knowing how to play it
however when i got it together it became one of my favorites until its demise in  when wanting to make an iso of my aging disc i found it with a huge crack on it under unknown circumstancesso now that ive got a little of my nostalgia out onto my review of this unique little gamegraphics blocky polygonal and furthermore colorful
in other words it is the typical ps game
nothing like a pss  but who caresmusic  a big kudos to the people who composed to the music because even after ten years it is still fun to listen to
catchy synthlike riffs fill this level each level having a unique soundtrack
whats also cool is when you crouch some of the instruments ceasesoundvoice acting the sounds while sort of primitive are also catchy
the swoosh of the net will be music to your ears along with the footsteps and other stuff
the voice acting while soso is actually the best voice acting in the trilogy
i wish the cast would have stayed for  and  but oh wellstory simple but pretty original
specter the most popular monkey in the monkey amusement park finds the professors peak point helmet which enhances intelligence
once he puts it on he wants revenge for being locked up in there so he makes more gives them to all the monkeys in the park and he raids the professors lab to use his time machine to rewrite history so apes can rule the world
now only spike who kind of looks like yugioh can capture the monkeys defeat specter and save his friend jake who is under specters controlgameplay now heres where the game truly shines
before i talk about the actual gameplay however let me discuss the controlsthe dualshock controller had been out for a while but was still unneeded to enjoy the game
all it provided was vibration and the ability to play with the analogue stick the right stick as useful as wisdom teeth
then ape escape came along and changed everything
those without ds controllers had to get some to enjoy this game whilst many tried to figure out the layout
the directional pads were only used for the camera while the triangle square cross and circle buttons were just used to change gadgets
it was then where the right stick the l and the r the latter both not having a title yet
it was just push the leftright stick down like a button finally got their chance
this paved way for more functions for the playstation controlleras for the gameplay itself it is a blast even if its your th play
you time travel to many eras your mission being to catch the apes
you also got gadgets which help you solve puzzles and catch some out of reach monkeys
you start off with a stun club and a net but you later get a total of nine gadgets each having their unique function
the apes themselves are diverse with each color of pants they wear representing their abilities
some move so fast that you must catch them via stealth
after all this was made a year after metal gear solid came out
you dont have to catch all the monkeys in the level some you cant until later when you got a different gadget but if you do you can play the level with a time trial which gives you nothing but is fun
you also need to catch every single ape if you want to catch specter
your health is represented by cookies
you can also get specter coins which allow you to play three different minigames once you get the required amount
theres a skiing game a boxing game and a space shooter game the last one the best imo
there are also two racing levels where you race the brainwashed jake for specter coinsas for bosses there are none until you get to crumbling castle
its a shame because the bosses are fun to fight
instead the game relies on enemies to keep you at bay besides the apes
you cant kill the apes but you can kill the enemies and get goods
youll have to search everywhere for those damn dirty apes from the ocean to the ice age to even inside a dinosaurape escape overall is quite a fun game
its not too hard but its still entertaining
this is a must buy
they also remade this game for psp but i never tried it
but i think ae is best on the big screen with a controllerthe entire ape escape series is amazing
the graphics are very good for the original ps and the gameplay is fantastic
im pressed for time so i have to give this game a graphics   nothing is ugly in ape escape it all looks totally fabulous
the character movements and designs are extremely nice and the attacks and training scenes are all beautifully put togethersound   a groovy score and neat sound editing techniques make ape escapes sound thoroughly plausiblevalue   endlessly fun to play
ape escape is a game you will start once and start again start once and start again
youll play it so many times you may take over  whole memory cardsoverall   this shouldnt be overlooked because of its frankly silly plot
its stunningly enjoyable to play and really gives a good use to the analogue controllerthis game is awesome
its been a long time since i played it but i know that from playing it its one of the best games you could own
its a very fun and creative game
the various levels and story make it a great game to enjoyyes its probably going to be difficult at times however not impossible just challenging
believe me having the challenge is totally worth iti remember going through it the levels were so very detailed and very well done
youd have to react fast at times and be smarteven more fun they even added some extras
i believe you might have to beat the game to unlock them but they are also great to play throughive played quite a few games since last i played this and this still ranks as one of the best games ive ever played
its a great worthwhile story which i think a lot of people would enjoyits got good length to the story a good difficulty and a reason to play on as well as to play againwhilst i know this is an older game something i know from playing a lot some of the old games are still some of the best games ever madei think breaking out the ps is worth it
although if you have a ps you can play it on there
i should know ive played another ps game on a pswell if youre just reading this to advertise or if youre reading this to buy take my advice this is a great find totally worth it
even if you dont want to get this for you if you know someone who wants to find a great game like this this is a game to getwell thanks for reading enjoy have a blastthis game was so cool it nearly gave me a heart attack literaly
the mad man none as specter who puts on blinking red yellow and blue helmets with sirens
the blue sirens mean they dont hear or see anything
the yellow sirens is when they hears something
and the red sirens is when they see you or if your chasing them
so specter put the helmets on them and formed a monkey army to destroy spike and jake
and you can get thounsands of gatcha gagets and im not telling you what they are
and gatcha coins and specter coins
you have to play this game
also play these games ape escape   ape escape i thought spyro the dragon was greatbut when i was donei was looking for some other great actionadventure gamesape escape took the place of excitmentand it didnt failyoull love this gameback when i first owned my playstation i tried many games from blockbuster
ive been a fan of crash bandicoot and actually it was that series that compelled me to choose a playstation over a saturn thank goodness so i quickly became of fan of platforming games
not to mention that i loved super mario  but since i didnt own an n i was forced to play it only when i visited my cousinsone day while browsing my local blockbuster my sister saw a cover with monkeys on it
with that and rugrats she checked out the counter with my selections and we went home that day to play games
i dont remember what games i checked out ffix
 but ape escape was the one title we played together until we had to return ither following birthday i bought it for her
you may think oh thats nice but i bought it because i actually wanted to play itit was the first game ive ever completed in its entirety and i go back from time to time to replay it no matter how many times ive caught the monkeys
the sequels are good but this stands out as the first game to fully require the dualshock controller and the music in this installment is my favorite in the seriesmonkeys have taken over different periods of history and so its your job to catch them all and bring down the leader
you get helpful gadgetry along the way and theyre all extremely useful and youll find yourself using them all to the very end
sometimes some games give you arsenals that become obsolete a few levels later not here
every level can use all your toolsthe boss fights are sparse but the final boss more than makes up for it
it remains one of my most favorite boss battles though by todays standards its pretty easyi write this review only a couple weeks after my latest playthrough and the game still holds up extremely well
i thought that with my years of gaming experience catching the monkeys would be a lot easier
while i know most of the games secrets and the easier levels were far easier than before the monkeys still prove a challenge to capture
the patterns for boss fights are easy to get down and i experienced no degradation in my original copy of the game when playing on a psthis game should be a requirement for all playstation ownersi got this game as a gift during the christmas of  and since that time it still is ranked as one of my top  favorite games
the graphics my be crap by todays standards but this game had a great story awesome gameplay and at the time mind blowing us of the dualshock controllerwhether youve played this game before or not if you want a trip down the nostalgic lane then play ape escapegreat game i dont really think its a little kid gameim  and i still think its toughthe controls are very hard to get used tobesides the goofy storyline and tough controls its still an awesome gameape escape is an awesome game with amazing graphics and great storyline
the game has over  different monkeys each with hilarious attitudes
this was no doubt my favorite game of all time cuz i just love playing adventureplatform games
this game is not easy to beat if you want to complete it 
there are time trials for almost every level and cool minigames
it took me over a month to beat the game  but im just an average gamer
i recommend this game cuz its fun exciting cool and cheap i read alots of review about this gamealot of people said that ape escape was goodso i decided to buy ape escape for myselfgeez they were rightthis game is great and funthis is a fun game i mean i have to catch those monkey on different level and sometime each land have  or  or over  that each of the land that the monkey staythere about  weapongaget that i can use to kill the enamy and to help me out on some hard place to reachthis game have  level and  monkey to catchthis game can be play for everyonequotlike the esrb rated said on the frontquotape escape is mild animated violencethere no gore or bad word on it quotjust wanted the parents to know itquoti never get tired of playing ape escapethis is a really fun to catch the monkeyget this game you wont be dissappointedi havent tooduke nukem  is a very well made game despite the fact that some people only know it for its controversial material most of it removed for the n version and its cheesy oneliners
it turns out that this game is much more than thatpros thirty challenging levels and they arent short either
were talking ten or more minutes on each for the first run secrets are abundant and it will take ages to find them all by yourself duke as a character is great adding humor to the game with his oneliners a well put together coop mode and a deathmatch mode with working bots four levels of difficulty even for the deathmatch mode a great control scheme for the n controller with added control schemes to have you pick fromcons hiccups in frame rate occur when several explosions appear on the screen the only music in the game is the title music no ability to save in the middle of the game you have to save at the beginning of a levelall in all this game is worth it
if you are looking for some challenging retro gaming action this is a musthave for your collectioni love this alien killing game
like every game they got there easy then there harder areas
from  to  a  i will say a great n
you may not be able to tell what he is standing on well that is the aliens he killedever since this was released iv heard nonstop complaints about this game from pc owners about the n port
yes it has some censorship the strippers dont strip
maybe the graphics werent as good
but for many of us this was our only option of playing this game
not everyone had pcs capable of playing games like duke d back in the late s so this was our best option
and hot damn
i got my moneys worth out of this game
not only is the single player tons of fun and have so much replay value
but the multiplayer as well
endless hours of death match wmy friends  i  it seems like especially in the s that pc gamers would get mad anytime a port of their games made it to the consoles
the graphics arent good enough the sound sucks the gameplay engine is broken ect ect
duke doom myst quakei heard it a million times
but imo opinion the ports were a way for the rest of us to experience these games
and i was glad to have emif you are a huge fan of the doom games then you will love this
its doom with more of a humorous sidethis game is the best
 people or  dukebots computer controlled multiplayer opponents hella cool to challenge in multiplayer each higher difficulty meaning more bodies flying in the airyou can have ppl and dukebots play at the same time  player coop and one heck of a single player experiance
who wouldnt want to save babes while bustin in a movie theater shooting alien scum all over the place
pig cop with a shotgun
introduce him to your grenade launcher battlelord giving you a hard time
throw him a pipe bomb party
your options of fighting opponents are endless with dukes arsenal of guns ranging from shotguns sub machine guns grenade launchers missle launchers all the way to trip minesgreat in multiplayer and shrink guns which allows you to shrink your opponents and crush like a bug with your  size boot
the guns are the best yet in an fps
the gameplay is hot as well your environment is your playground use toilets blow up toilets bust open a movie screen in the theatres discover cool secrets by blowing open walls play pool the list goes on
bust open aliens as you make your way saving babes searching for key cards finding hot new weapons and having one helluva time
do you have what it takes to save earth from aliens can duke save his babes before aliens use them for mass production weird i know always bet on duke
are you bored of my review and eager to get this game
stop reading the thing and get duke nukem this is my favorite duke nukem game
its got a ton of levels to explore and the variety in the levels keeps things interesting
i played it when it first came out for the n and after beating it traded it
i got nostalgic for it so bought it again last year to play
what a great trip down memory lane
i was taken back to the first time i played it and it was just as fun
the graphics look even better on my  lcd than they ever did on my old tube tv
a great game for those who like older shooters with some humornever did i think i would be able to own this game because of the prices ive seen it listed as found it for a steal brand new and works great
havent stopped playing this hardcore final fantasy fan is beyond pleasedi saved my allowance for weeks to buy this game when it first game out
now that im an adultunless you ask my wife this game is just as awesome as it was then as it is now
the graphics are a bit old but the storyline is one of the best i have ever seen to datethey really hit the mark on this one
characters storyline play music graphics everything just superb for its time
i played this game over and over again just to play it
its a fun game but out of all the times i played it i could never defeat the ruby weapon
i think hes like impossible or something
lol  but even so that wasnt much of a let down because the rest of the game was so cool
and sephiroth what a perfect villan
he looked pretty cool
if youve never played any of the ff series and even if you have this is a definite must havefinal fantasy  is a classic
the game is great
the characters are special the graphics were pretty good for its time the game play was on point and who can really mention final fantasy  without mentioning the freaking music
i really love the characters and just about everything else about the game
however when you mix in the music everything just fit
i think this was the second final fantasy title i played after  after playing       tactics and the first tactics advance game i must say that this game is still my favorite final fantasy
its spectacular
and while i honestly dont think i could play through the game again today it still holds up as one of the best games ive ever played
definitely the best rpg game ive ever played
if i hadnt booted it up and played it so much in the past i might feel different about owning it again
however if youve never played the game do you live under a rock
then its really a great idea to try it somehow
if you missed it because you were too youngnot born when it came out in  then do so
now
 starswow the reviews here run the gamut while i am not surprised to see many bad reviews sometimes i think that people are just feeling spiteful as i myself have another incarnation that does the same thing it is odd to read such statements as quotthis is destined to be the most disappointing rpg everquot and forgive me for ruining your writing for the sake of comprehensiblilty
ffvii was released in  became possibly the bestselling rpg ever has been lauded by most critics for years and this is  i think the ship of destiny has sailedanyway i love this game
i have played it multiple times and while it isnt my favorite ff title that honor is shared by ffvi and ffviii it holds a special place in my heart
i read in the spotlight above that one reviewer gave up on the game because aeris died this seems odd i mean really these are only video game characters and can someone really get worked up that much over the merelyphysical death of a single heroine
i myself found this a bit silly characters get killed all the time in rpgs didnt cloud have a phoenix down on hand
 but it didnt detract from my enjoyment of the game
the gameplay the sidequests the graphics for their time the chocobos  all come together quite well in this title
i particularly enjoyed the frustration and ultimate satisfaction of defeating emerald and ruby and the storyline is ok as well
im sure that everyone has played this but if you havent well give it a tryi love this game
its probably not the best final fantasy but its still just so awesome
the graphics make the characters look like theyre built of legos by todays standards and the story is confusing but i still love it
its got some of the best characters and one of the best soundtracks of any video game and if youre a video gameplayer and havent yet played this then get on itsephiroth the main villian of the game is probably the bestdressed villian in a ff game
also he has the most sinister theme of any villian in any game
everything about sephiroth is sinisteryou play cloud a man from the small city of nibelheim sounds like a city in germany
cloud works for avalanche a terrorist group thats fighting against the evil shirna inc  as the game unfolds you learn that shirna inc does far more evil than avalanche does
shirna inc knows no end to its evilone of the best games for the psfinal fantasy  is the first final fantasy on the psx and the first ff to not go through quotthe nintendo filter see ff ii usquot
this game is an instant classic and if you have never played this game or even seen it you are missing out
this game has it all
a good story which i still debate certain things about with friends excellent battles fun characters and all kinds of mini games aka
the gold saucer
this also was the pioneering of fmv on gamesthe materia system in this game takes quite a long time to understand but it will happen while you go through the game the first time
thankfully there are plenty of tutorials in the game and the manual does a good job of explaining thingsone thing i didnt like in this game is you can only have  party members in your battling party
this takes away from the strategy of battles
the only things that make your characters different is their limit breaks and what materia you have equipped to that character and what weapon each uses
the translation is a little weird at times but acceptable
after all it was sony that translated it i believebut that last paragraph aside why are you still waiting to play this game if you havent already
buy it used buy it new borrow it from a friend do something
rent it and play it for  straight nonsleep hours
you wont regret it no matter what you dowow
this is truly the best game ever
if youre going to buy any game this year buy this one
full of charecters and storyline
just go to the store right now and buy this gamethis is the best game i have ever played in my whole existence
it has a great story and great fighting any one who likes rpgs will like this game
i have beaten it three times and i still want to beat it a lot moreno matter how ugly this game is i will never stop loving itthe characters are great the story is awesome i like the battle system and materia is easy to train and usetheres a lot of places to visit lots of bosses to defeatit is really the characters that makes this gamesimply the best rpg ever made  final fantasy  is the frist d final fantasy for playstation and it is the best rpg with the best grafics best songs  and best plots no rpg compares to him as a video game perfectionist i have played this game repeatedly over and over and over again in the past  years its been available for two reasons
one to experience the game that it is again and againthis game never gets old or boringever
ill be  years old and i would turn to this game to play it instead of helping the wife find her denturesthe second reason is because i am currently in a playthrough of this game that i intend to make the absolute perfect fileand i am actually  chocobracelets and  precious watch away from doing soby perfect and i could go on forever here since it took me forever without cheating whatsoever to achieve perfection i mean every item vagyrisk claw earth mallet fourth bracelet behemoth horn or umbrella anyone
those are just a few of the rarest items int he game all available materias set up on all  characters with the perfect combination so you can go into any and all battles press attack once or cast knights of the round once put the controller down and go take a leak while the game beats itselfalso i have  of all the items possible to have  ofexcept some of the weapons and armoryou dont really need  gold bangles or  wmachine gunsone of each weapon and  of each armor will sufficeone for each characterand lastly and this is the hardest and most important to achieve  status of every possible stat strength speed luck vitality spirit and magicive spent over  hours alone in the crashed gelnika morphing enemies for the sources to max out my statsand it is no easy taskyoull need to morph about  unknown s for power sources per character  poodlers for speed sources per character  bad raps for luck sources per character  unknown s for guard sources per character  serpents for mind sources the hardest one to obtain per character and  unknown s for magic sourcesper character
so in the end youre looking at morphing over  enemiesfun fun funbut if youre dedicated or insane whatever you like like meit can be donei love this game so much and am so dedicated from all these years i could go into a boss battle stripped of all materia and weapons and armor and not take a hitand win the battle with ease
 luck evades all enemy hits on me  strength guarantees a hell of a hit on the enemy in retaliation for even thinking they can touch me
not to mention the  speedallowing me to get in sometimes  or  hits on the enemy before they can even notice who just killed their pathetic ahehegraphics sound playability controlsetcall  out of 
dont miss out on the experience that is final fantasy whenever im asked what my favorite game of all time is the answer is always rather clear final fantasy vii
no game before it and no game since then has managed to pull me so deeply into the story and have me hanging on every word like this one did
the characters the music the graphics the story its all goldenthe characters are simply unforgettable
cloud aeris and yuffie were my favorites of the bunch
each character has such wonderful design half realistic half cartoonish full detailed backgrounds and such personality and potential to develop that i enjoyed following everyone one of themthe music and graphics sticks in my mind like nothing else
they worked so well together
from simple cut scenes to the most glorious of fmv
and unlike todays games that throw long boring fmv in just for the sake of filling  dvds this game used fmv to make a point so poetically you couldnt help but feel like you just watched an epic film
to this day theres scenes that i cheer and nearly tear up over when i see them replayed
there were scenes that i would literally hold my breath through just in awe of not just the graphics but the sound the motion the story unfolding so elegantly
squaresoft has a knack for this no doubt about it
this is the lord of the rings film of video gamesi wish i could sit here and just ramble on and on about the beautiful story and the twists turns and major events but obviously that would ruin it for any who still havent played this masterpiece of a game
i see many many people today who have never played a game like this and are simply enthralled by todays crop of ps rpg wannabes and it really irks me
they simply dont know what theyve missed and  times of  simply dont careive probably played through this  some hour quest at least  times and i enjoyed it every bit as much each time through
it may not have the  hours of todays games but unlike todays games its not freaking simulated boredom
its  hours of fun and story like youve never seen before
this game changed my perspective of how videogames could be and is guaranteed a lifetime place in my favorite collection rirathcomff is the greatest installment in the whole final fantasy genre
its d graphics badass music and intense deep storyline make it a classic to all ff fans out there
this game really got me hooked on ff
i beat  and  but they didnt pull me in like this one
this game has the coolest villian in any of the games
sephiroths looks attitude and sword skills can really kick your ass
the music in this game is also kick ass
so i would reccomend this game to a ff beginner or a veteran because it is absolutely flawless and i think its the best game ever madewhat other video game has had a review put in quotes on the back saying quite possibly the greatest game ever madeive just bought my  and love playing it
ive been playing games since oldschool nintendo
i remember getting mario bros  for christmastheres only one game that has ever been able to take me completely out of my element and take hold of everything i love about games and never let gothis is the masterpiece that is final fantasy viifinal fantasy  aka
final fantasy  on the snes was a great success
many magazines like gamepro and egm have praised it for its rich plot and complex scenarios
nintendo power even called it the rpg hit of the decade
fans of the super nintendo and rpgs rejoiced over how great this game was and with a slew of other rpgs on the system like chrono trigger actraiser and nintendos a link to the past a lot of fansmyself includedgenerally regard this period as one of the best video game production times of our generation if not the bestalong comes the sony playstation
for some this marks the end of the golden age of classic video games
i dont entirely agree as that system was the home of a handful classics castlevania symphony of the night revitalized the castlevania series and outranked many of the d games that cropped up at the time
metal gear solid redefined stealth action and brought solid snake into the mainstream
mega man x continued the saga of mega man x and combined the oldschool flavor of mega man with arcadestyle frenetic actionnow we get into final fantasy   the first game besides the original to be correctly numbered
if youve read my ff review i said that that game was the end of the magic era and the introduction of industrial technology
ff takes that further into a dystopian technological atmosphere its bleak dark outlook is not dissimilar to ridley scotts blade runner
this was a stark contrast to the previous games that were about grandiose medieval adventure
no more dragons colorful highlands and sorcery
no more saving the princess from mortal doom
no more four crystals and light warriorswhen i first played this game back in  my first thought was this isnt final fantasy
i mean they curse in the game too
how dare they change my final fantasy
how dare they take away what i loved about it
yet many of my friends loved it and still love it for its nostalgic factor
heck its sold over ten million copies worldwide making it the highestselling final fantasy of all timecoming from that stubborn mold i didnt give the game an objective eye and realized years later that i initally rejected it under a false pretense
is it my favorite final fantasy game of all time
well no but i am giving it its credit now and there are many aspects of the game that help make it the topselling final fantasy gamethe story centers on a former soldier named cloud strife who joins the avalanche group in trying to take down shinra inc a megolomaniacal corporation thats draining the planets life force
hes a bit less colorful than some of the main characters of past final fantasies even further games but through the course of the game he has a very interesting backstory
he is joined by barrett the leader of avalanche and the closest video game character akin to mr t tifa lockhart a sexy martial artist and friend of clouds aeris a flower merchant who turns out to be a cetra the previous owners of the planet red xiii a cat creature that was experimented on by shinra cid highwind a pilot with dragoon knight characteristics and ironically shares the same last name as kain from final fantasy 
what delight
 vincent an immortal that previously worked with shinra before his deathand yuffie a young thief who plays tricks on the party
oh and then theres cait sith but lets move onthe villain that everyone talks about from this game is sephiroth
in my ff review i thought kefka was the best final fantasy villain ever
i still believe that but sephiroth is still one of the greatest villains in any rpg
sephiroth does have some interesting motives he is originally clouds friend even a mentor and the best member of soldier for a time
however upon learning what appeared to be his real past not quite real but no spoilers here
 he progressively goes insane and is hell bent on bringing back the promised land which basically means wounding the planet and sucking its life force
while hes not your typical heartless villain not saying kefka is typical but you feel from the first hour of that game that he is downright evil
 he is a mentally distraught horribly twisted person and that progression of madness that worsens throughout the game is actually very well transitioned
plus he is responsible for murdering aeris scarring the mind of my rpg generation foreverwhile the battle system only allows three people the materia system and the limit breaks add fun to the game
while i adore final fantasy  s limit breaks worked better and they also level up
the materia system is based on your weapons and items slots allowing you to interchange materia like ice fire lightning restore and other things
they also do things differently depending on how theyre linked to other materia and also if theyre attached to your weapon or your accessory
this adds some fun to the battle and you can even interchange materia without disrupting the level of the particular materia slot youre usingthe story is as epic as any great final fantasy should be although i do admit that the ending is a bit laxstill it was followed up by sequels so at least the story did continue
most of the characters are interesting even colorful cid and barretts constant swearing definitely added flavor to this ff entry
clouds complex relationships with aeris and tifa are among the storys highlights and of course the culmination of cloud facing his former friend and idolthe music is once again composed by nobou uematsu and he delivers once again
my only complaint is not with his compositions itself but with the sound quality
the sony playstation had a superior sound chip system in comparison to the super nes yet the sound quality of games like chrono trigger and final fantasy  er 
blasted you with superb sound quality
i dont hold this against the game to any large degree but i did find that kind of oddespecially if you hear michiru yamanes score for symphony of the night or toshihiko horiyamas score for mega man xoverall my final opinion of the game
ive grown to like this game despite my love for the more medievalstyled final fantasies of the past
this one was a departure from the past adding more mature elements into the game colorful language sexual references etc
etc
definitely your big brothers kind of rpg
while some may dispute its overrated longevity its success on the sony playstation became a part of that systems legacy and it also brought rpgs to the mainstream audienceyes its insanely popular but give the game its due
its worthy of the qualities that have made it the bestselling final fantasy and while it may not be my personal favorite it kicks major amounts of awesome nonethelessother recommendationsfinal fantasy  in my opinion perfectly accompanies this gamechrono trigger snesbreath of fires  and  snespsxxenogears psxcastlevania symphony of the night psxthis game brings back memories of when jason came over my house with his ps memory card and he was playing parappa the rapper in the basement and he was cool and this little girl she was a baby back then and now she should be around  years old well she was sucking on the memory card and when we put the card in everything was deleted lol
and this game is great from graphics to gameplay to music
it has everything
you want a love story it has it
you wanna cry it has it
you wanna feel good it has it
everything it has to offer
the only this it doesnt have is for  attracting ignoramouses that overlook the game and only care about whats new and graphics
and mike used to like it and he is in sog  lifepeople seem to forget the number one reason final fantasy  is loved so fondly and remembered all these years later it was one of the first video games able to tell a story that millions of people cared about
in fact its probably the first rpg to ever tell such an incredible story
it was also groundbreaking back in the day having extremelyrealistic cutscenes featured along with a quest that carried over  discs
thats why the game is rememberedhowever i have no idea why the price for the game jumped up to almost  bucks these days
i guess because everyone who owns the game refuses to give up their copyplaystation  owners out there with a penchant for rpg games probably need no good word of mout from me as this game is one of the staples for the system
however for those who dont have this game get itit wasnt until the greatest hits version came out that i ever really took an interest in final fantasy vii
i guess it was because i wanted to pursue the game in my own time
besides back when this game first came out you hardly ever found a copy on the shelf to buy
i was always one of the unlucky ones it seemed
finally after obtaining a copy for myself i got to see what all the hoopla was aboutthe story itselfas you probably already know by playing it is about cloud strife
cloud is a mercenary who joins with a group of othersavalanche to stop a megacorporation callled shinra
shinra is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source
course the story progresses and deepens when sephiroththe games main antagonist comes into play
sephiroths part in this storyif the world is damaged its lifestream will gather together in an attempt to heal the wound
sephiroth plans to use a powerful spell called meteor to cause this injury and then merge with the planets energy allowing him to be reborn as a god
then he plans to rule over the planetfinal fantasy vii has a long history behind it
ff was planned first as a new game for the snes and was quickly moved to nintendos new system at the time the nintendo  due to lack of catridge storage capacity it eventually led to a dispute between nintendo and square that resulted in square ending its long relationship with nintendo
square decided from that point to release final fantasy vii for the sony playstation
the game has went on to sell well over  million copies worldwide
its spawned a series of other games under the ff name but none have quite reached the status that the original has
a remake has been rumored for quite some time now but as of yet no remake has been produced by square
my opinion on the remake or lack thereof
well considering at to how they made a killing on fans buying the first game when it came out its almost guaranteed that they would make a killing a second time
i dont understand why they wont give the fans what they want
theyd come out alot better because of it
it would definitely put them back on top as the leader of rpgsto be sure
course enough on the subject rightonto the meat of this reviewwhat do i think of final fantasy vii
first and foremost it is quite an achievement in the rpg genre
it was the rpg where players found themselves in a threedimensional world that after playing the game they actually felt like theyd went on an epic journey
its the only game other than legend of zeldaocarina of time where i ever felt that way
it was also the first rpg to really evoke some emotion out of me
the characters werent twodimensional they had character and you could invest in that
it helped set the standard for all other rpgs to follow to this day
too bad though you hardly see traditional turnbased rpgs like these anymore
sure you may on the nintendo ds and the sony playstation portable but not much on any of the console systems these days
while it may seem dated in a time when everything is in d and not d on prerendered backgrounds it still stands the test of time
the story holds up as well even if it is a little hard to figure things out at times
the battles are engaging and the game is just fun
while i wont say its my most favorite ff game its one of the games that got me hooked on rpgs
theres never a shortage of good things that can be said about this gamedo i have any gripes about the game
just one thingthe ending
the ending is kind of sudden and as another reviewer stated elsewhere it just ends
not quite like legacy of kainsoul reaver did back in the day thoughnothing like that
the way it ends leaves you wanting more
maybe it was intended to be that wayyou thinkall in all final fantasy vii is a game that i highly highly recommend that everyoneand i do mean everyone should playat least onceeven if youre not into rpgs
itll definitely give you a better understanding of rpgs and why people love playing them so muchlet me start off by saying final fantasy vii is highly revered by many gamers as the best of the series and like stated before like the indie music scene its cool to hate what is so popular strictly because it has mass appeal
i am a musician and ive fallen victim to this mindset many times before with pop music and ive learned when it boils down to it like what you like and dont worry about the mass appeal
i am not afraid to stick to my gun this game is the best ive ever playedthis game was released in  and it was a launch game for the ps
i own a ps now and surely the games graphics cannot compare to anything today but when it was released it had beautiful graphics compared to snes or genisis graphics weve seen before and brought to life d textures which has not been seen in video gaming before
i still recall to this day playing through this game on the brand new playstation and getting fully absorbed in the story graphics and game play
i still play through this game to this day atleast once a year just to recap the wonders of this gamethis games story is easily the most impressive story line i have encountered in video gaming history
i could read this story as a book and it would be the best book ive ever read
the character development with the exception of cait sith strictly matter of opinion there always seems to be one character that never gets much use in rpgs for me and twists and turns make this game a epic timeless classic even if you can muster through the bad graphics compared to this generation
i am a huge rpg fan spanning back to the snes days first game system and playing the greats like chrono trigger and final fantasy  and  and really enjoyed those
needless to say this trumps all those games
i also played the more recent final fantasy games and still feel this game overtakes those
i was disapointed to see such neglect from final fantasy  because of its roots to the old school ff titles because ff quite possibly was most peoples first ff game
ff is easily number  in my game rankings
now there seems to be a clear cut line between fans of ff and ff
its usually you either like ff or you like ff and you cant like both
this is the case for me and many of my fellow ff gamers
i disliked  very much because it strayed away from what was beautiful about the ff series
i also feel the same with ff
ff strayed away from the ff series but kept old school ff gamers still intregedthis is your typical turn based ff battle system which many people tend to claim is a bad thing about rpgs and i think the exact opposite
turn based games let you think and figure out what you need to do to defeat a certain enemy and not the same technique is going to work for every enemy which i feel other genres tend to look over
needless to say if story is more important than gameplay to you than this game is worth a run through
if youre like many others and hate turn based games and could care less about a story and you just want to have fun without any of those constrictions you might want to save your time and skip this titleanother thing that is worth an honorable mention is ffs wonderful lush soundtrack
i can listen to the soundtrack to this day and it will bring in the great memories of playing this game
the experiences of the game are excelently tied into the music and it will stick with you everytime you hear the score
i feel the strongest out of the ffs sound track is ff for its pure variety in musical concepts but ff comes in a close secondknights of the round materia makes this game fairly unfair but to balance it out they added two super bosses which are incredibly fun and even out the playing fieldi dont consider myself a hardcore gamer but when it comes to rpg games ill make the exception
ive played nearly every ff game to date and enjoy the ups and downs of each game
i also play other genres too and even through genre crossing this is my favorite game of all time and i think that wont change
the story is emotional ill admit it it made me cry thats how intense i felt it was alright time to man up and very intense if you can follow it
this game made me offically a follower of rpg video gamingif you own a ps psone ps or a shutter ps
then you need this gamei cannot express how good it is
go to any fan website on the internet and read up on ityou will get a good  hours of gameplayanyone can just pick up and play although this is not a game for those under  many many cusses suggestive themes and animated violencebut that is why it is rated t of courseplease note that the aforemetioned warning isnt that graphic just enough to not be suitable for an  year oldoverallgameplayoriginalitystorylinefun overall score  yeah i love it that much  lets face itfinal fantasy vii got the whole thing started again
back in the old days of bit consoles and commodore s when apple computers wasnt nerdspeak for i dont know how to run my machine rpgs were a very narrowly targeted genre with little flavor or flash in them and as the consoles outpaced the appeal of the text based graphics poor style they started to fall out of favor
it was this game that opened the door for the whole next generation of rpgs and brought the genre into the mainstream and this game did all those things for very good reasonsill start with the good because i feel the need to stress that this is a game youll probably enjoy
there are a lot of flaws but the fact of the matter is that youll probably only notice them if you go looking for them
what the game has going for it is a fairly intuitive gameplay interface a cast of interesting characters and a story that combines innovation with the same old epic qualities to make a nice comforting blend
those are the most evident qualities this game has and they outweigh the shortcomings by a long waybut there are shortcomings they are significant and they need to be admitted to
first off the graphics are just terrible by todays standards
forget historyi want to know if this things going to look good right now and this is probably the worst game in the entire series in terms of current presentability
the cg movies while impressive are exceeded with flagrant ease by every other subsequent square release the screens are drawn in a fuzzy fashion that gave me a headache if i tried to play for more than two hours in a row and the game suffers from severe graphical design schizophrenia
while i have enough imagination to reconcile the blocky superdeformed character models used through most of the game with the slick properly proportioned cg figures that will definitely cause some people trouble
while this game was certainly visually impressive when it came out these days it just doesnt cut muster and you need to keep that in mind when you pick it up even its next closest sequel in the series was infinitely betteryou will notice the graphics problemsthis game also can have race issues if you want it to
if youre overly sensitive about the issue id avoid this title
barrett is the only black man in the entire universe and hes not that complimentary a character
i dont particularly carehe was supposed to be mr t and he turned out well in that regard but if you intend to read some kind of general statement on the merit of people of a particular shade you may as well just let this one pass bythe story is also a problem contrary to the high praise that diehard fans often give it
this story is confusing for no particular reason and the writers are totally lost in terms of how they want to tell their tale
i like the characterstell me what happens to them
no
okaythen im saving the world
so why do i care about this schmos childhood trauma
the total effect was that when i got to the end of the game i felt incredibly shortchanged in terms of story fulfillment since the characters significance pretty much takes a nose dive on the third disk
the story is needlessly complex at points and the major inconsistencies arent dealt with particularly well i do not consider a tube of goo an effective address to a plot hole
while the plot is innovative and epic it is also confused and meandering and you may have to play through it twice to figure out whats going onagain though i should stress that these problems arent going to be too big if you dont want them to be
these are things that you can ignore very easily while you play through the game
the gameplay itself ranks among the best balanced ever with random monster encounters a bad idea but one that every game without grandia or chrono in the title seems to stick with well tailored to the characters levels and the game remaining appealing and challenging throughout
this one will appeal to just about anybody and it should be in any rpg fans libraryall in all it is impossible to not recommend final fanatsy vii to anyone who is even vaguely interested in rpgsfinal fantasy  is the best final fantasy game its fun and addicting great story awsome fun overall greatthis for me was truly a wonderful experience
ive played this game countless times yet over and over i find myself wondering why
when i first played this game i had no idea i was immersing myself into the abstract but gorgeous world of final fantasy vii
you are the hero of course and youre out to save the world one step at a time
and really thats exactly what you do in ffvii
in classic final fantasy style the seventh game in the series brings cloud a mercenary now working for a terrorist group into your head
as you play you can really understand where the characters come from and what their real selves are like
it might sound weird but this is truly an incredible game
a wonderful experience for anyone who likes this series or anyone looking for an absolutely outstanding storythis is just one of those classic games to find my childhood
it really was one of the best rpgs money could buy and still is
just look at all the fanfare around the game the reason why people still play and talk about this gamei being a veteran of videogaming have to say im very dissapointed in the recent reviews bashing this game
final fantasy vii is what made rpg gaming what it is todaythat being said this game now well beyond its years is still the best rpg i have ever played
close to being the best game ever
by todays standards the graphics are horrid but couldnt have been done better
very colorful and every part of this game was a refreshing look at something new
your charachter goes from a centrally located city to fortified town to a beach resort to an amusment park and so on and so on
at one point you end up in outerspace
there is to much to describe in a review lets just say there is plenty to see and dothe gameplay is rediculously addictive
the materia gems were a good idea
being able to fit elemental materia to weapons and armor allowed for great flexability
combo certain materia together and your charachter could attack from two to eight times in one turn
the junction system in ff  is based on the materia system
those who perfer  over  should compare and see that they are in fact fairly similar
changing materia in midbattle would have been nice in case of an attack that heals instead of hurting takes one or more members of the attack team out of actionthe amount of mini games is the most ever for any ff
the amusment park has an arcade and rides
a battle arena to compete for really good prizes
you can bet on race and breed chocobos
the amount of things to do is astounding
the sidequest are fun and can help your party if you complete them
one could easily get lost and forget about the main storythe story is not the greatest but it held my intrest when i first played ff
you never really take it seriously until one of your party members is killed  way in the game
the true enemy of this game is a cold blooded man with destruction and death left in his wake
the corporate enemy is nothing more than sidetracking cannon fodder for you to level up with
i guarentee a sense of satisfaction when finally putting the last boss awayfor anything else just for revenge would be motive enough
all charachter development is well done but a little awkward at times
trying to make this story serious and funny at the same time often leaves players wondering where the story is headed
for the most part no complaints about the story
its told with the player in mind
trying to find a way to connect with the playerthe musical score fits this game
only ff ff in the states is done better
at no point in this game does the music not fit the scenario the player is currently travelingthis game got a lot of publicity during its arrival and rightfully so
a magnificent piece of not only gaming but art
every rpg made after ff is based on what this game revolutionized
rpg before this were all d and pretty much cookie cutter rpg
this game literally changed rpg into what it is now i hope those who recently bought this game at least attempt to finish it to gain the games beauty as a whole
those who had this game from the beginning already know that final fantasy vii is not only a great game but arguably psx best of all time
a milestone periodmany years have passed since i first played this amazing title
love it or hate it final fantasy  broke new ground in the rpg market and games today have a lot to be thankful for that final fantasy  made possiblefor those who havent played this title it is going to appear very dated especially the hideously deformed polygon characters
but the backgrounds are beautiful scenes based on hand drawn pictures
the backgrounds are set so they dont move
instead you move around them
it was a style used extensively on the ps and still used in other games today especially on the portable systems
granted many of us would love to see a remake and that might happen someday but not likely any year sooni will just sum up what i love about this game even in todays market of amazing games and a lot of terrible games or super easy games also
first the game was insanely easy
i died once on my first play through against lost number before i realized what to do and i dont believe i saw a gameover screen since
but the ease of the game is not an issue
there is still some challenge and part of what makes the game enjoyable is the lack of cheap enemies
but once you get the hang of things it is super easythe story is amazing and only final fantasy  has really compared
final fantasy  was such a great title that i never thought anything could top it but ff just drew me in and didnt let me go
i couldnt believe the intrigue the depth the complexity of the story
i found myself on edge at school i was in high school when it first released and i couldnt wait to get home to play it
when cloud goes against rufus near the end of the midgar arc i knew i loved this game
when it took over  hours of game play to get to a world map i knew something was special
and when the game cuts in real time to the cg of junons cannon i was stunnedwith the pretty games of this era one might be unimpressed but if you remember the era when this game was made it broke ground that developers feared
first true epic big budget rpg with cut scene cgi
low to zero loading times so happy for that
a central character that is killed mid way through the game
and an amazing depth of side quests and extras at the end of the game that were fun and rewardinggoing back it may not match up against some more recent titles in every facet but overall this is still a solid and spectacular game
in my opinion only zelda the ocarina of time and super mario world can compare with this title in overall quality and fun
though i have other personal favorites big shout out for ogre battle
 i cannot argue that final fantasy  is among the three best games of all time and easily the most ground breaking rpg ever
as nostalgic as the earlier titles are and i love them all this game just proves that solid gameplay and an amazing story are timelessyou know a game is probably pretty good when it has over  reviews written about it
this review hopefully will be slightly different than most  i love rpgs but never played ffvii back in the day and just completed it for the first time
so im not really biased due to loving the game back in my younger years and will try to review with an objective eyeas you can probably gather from the mountain of other reviews this was the game that for better and worse changed the rpg genre
the somewhat dense storyline basically revolves around cloud and company in their quest to save the planet from various forces mainly the evil company shinra and the very very evil bad guy sephiroth
several traditional rpg elements are present  battle monsters equip magic find new and better weapons grind your character up etcso what made the game different
basically two things in my opinion
the first as talked about above is the storyline
yeah its the typical save the world stuff that can be found in oodles of other rpgs but this it is different  it was deep filled with twists and turns and was more like an actual story you would find in a novel
some would say the story borders on being convoluted a complaint i have a hard time arguing with but it holds up well today and was nothing short of groundbreaking  years agothe second was the amazing graphics and cut scenes
of course neither are nearly as good as the more recent stuff but again it was revolutionary at the time and everybody loved it
combining the fun elements of rpgs that were already present with a deeper story and amazing graphics and it is no wonder this is one of the most beloved games of all timestill the game does have its warts
first it is a very linear story
part of the charm of some of those early final fantasy games and other rpgs was the feeling you could explore the entire world
here for about twothirds of the game you have no control over where your characters go or what happens its really like reading a book
by the time you actually get the airship and can really start exploring you are just about ready for the final showdown
plus some of the really cool weapons to found cannot be obtained until you have virtually completed the game final fantasy games have done this for years and i have never understood it what is the point of these amazing weapons when by the time you can acquire them your characters are so leveled up they are killing everything with ease anyway
the second major issue touched on above is the fact that this story is tough to keep up with at times
ive played crisis core the prequel to this game and that helped a lot but there are times when you are just going to be like what in the blue sane hll is going on here
yeah the story is different but different isnt always betteroverall the game is one of those games that should be played by all gamers
yeah there are problems the story the somewhat dated graphics the linear game play but its still an amazing play
by the way you can download the game from the playstation store for both the psp and ps for  so do not pay these insanely high pricesthis is probably the best rpg that ever has and ever will be released
ive had it since its release in  and beat it several times and i plan to again
it just doesnt get old
the graphics are still great but a little outdated of course because technology is getting better
but it still looks pretty
the battle system is the best of any of the final fantasy games even the newer ones
in fact i think that the battle system of ff is the best of any rpg
the music composition is great as well even if it is just one guy on a synthesizer
its great
lets see the gameplay is perfect the music is perfect the battle system is perfect the characters are loveable and the best part isthe story
this game is truly a classic and i recommend it to collectors and gamers alikethis game blew me away when i first bought it
its one of the best final fantasy games out there
the graphics arent great but you should mostly enjoy the storyline not how it looksthe story begins when cloud strife a teenager who joined a secret organization known as avalanche tries to help destroy huge machines called mako reactors which suck the planets life energy away in order for electricity to exist in midgar a city
oh and as for the evil man whos behind this deed
president shinra
it was the president of midgar who built the reactors and now its up to cloud tifa barret and the rest of avalanche to bring shinra co downbut after cloud meets an old friend from long ago the story quickly takes an unexpected twistin this game youll experience many different emotions for the characters youll fight hideously powerful bosses find two secret characters even breed chocobos like you could in previous final fantasy games
and dont forget that you can even enter them in races as well
there are just so many more reasons to call this game classic so i recommend you find it and have huge loads of funi doubt that there will ever be an equal to this epic game final fantasy vii
its the reason i became the gamer i am todayfinal fantasy vii puts you in the shoes of a young man by the name of cloud strife
starting off youre simply a mercenary hired by a resistance force called avalanche whom are fighting against the earthdominating orginization shinra
progressing through the story however you find it goes much deeper than that
throughout his adventure cloud strives to find the link between him and his arch enemy but once friend sephiroth what shinra is planning for the world and struggles to find where his emotions lie in a deep love triangle between his longtime friend tifa and the kindhearted flower girl aeris
of course along the game there are many other characters and submissions that lead to different stories but either way this game promises to leave a lasting impressionthe gameplay much like the story is simply amazing
as you progress through the game you will find new accesories items such as rings ear rings ribbons etc
 armor and weapons
depending on each items power your overall strength for attacks defense against attacks magic effectiveness and magic defense will increase however the true depth comes in the junction system
each item you equip to yourself will give you junction blocks
these blocks are used to equip magic that you buy or find along your journey
magic comes in many formssome increase stats some heal some are attacks some are devastating monsters called summons that unleash devastating attacks on all enemies and some help you attain more items such as the ability to steal
junctioning magic can also lower stats bringing more strategy into the game
junction too much magic and your characters overall hp or health points which decrease with each hit will be minimized in the next battle
junction to little and your character will be to weak to inflict any useful damage on the enemymy final great aspect in this epic edition of this great series is the music
the music in the game effects your overall emotions as you play making the game look and feel even more amazing
i guarantee that after playing this game youll find yourself humming at least two of its tracksso in conclusion this game is flawless
if you want something that will satisfy your gaming pleasure for many a day this is it
final fantasy vii is quite possibly the best game ever made and in my opinion is still unrivaledmy cousin was a huge rpg fan before i was and one day i got money for my birthday and i went uptown and he came along
he saw final fantasy vii on the shelves and bugged me to get it
so i eventually got it but found he was playing it more than me
so when he wasnt around i sneaked and played his game and i got so wrapped up in the game i forgot i was still playing his game and he missed some plot elements
but i couldnt contain myself cause this was one of the best games i played and still do im currently on my th playstory cloud a former soldierkind of like an elite squad member is recruited by avalanche to help bring down the shinra corporation whose reactors are draining the planet of its energy
where it goes from there involves a being from the sky genetic experimentation and mind freakoutsmusic some of the best music ever is on the soundtrack
one track aeriss theme is worth the price of it alone
this song cant be put into words one of the most beautiful compositions ive ever listened toand its played in a sad scene but i wont spoil it
but this soundtrack also included a wide variety of music like rockboss battle themenew age soundingcity of the ancients funk likewall market to ominousthose chosen by the planetgraphics back in  these graphics were jawdropping
that opening sequence with aeris the entrance to gold saucer and awakening of ancient beings were just amazing
they seem tame now but back then they were gorgeous
it isnt flawless though the characters look blocky like itll have a big block for a hand and in some cases you can see them without a mouth but it doesnt detract from the feel of the gameand one thing to note if youve havent played a final fantasy before yes it is part vii but its not like a saga where each part is a continuation of the story
its all new story characters villains worlds etcfor your spells and abilities it includes the materia system
while im not gonna spoil what a materia is the basic function of it is to give you special abilities
equip it on your weapon or armor and you can cast magic summon beasts counterattack steal or give you some benefits
master it and itll create a new one
so awesome materia like ultima knights of the round or mime can be replicated giving you almost an endless string of summonsin vi and in viii certain special attacks can be accessed when a character was low health
here its a bar that fills up whenever you get attacked
fill it up and you can unleash a string of powerful attacks one big beam or even cure party members
one flaw is that regular attacks cant be accessed so you cant save it for an approaching boss you either have to use magic or just defendthis is one of the best games youll play and even though theres other games out currently that can distract it always helps to go back to what started it all what brought people into the rpg genre in a huge way final fantasy viii have played final fantasy vii everyday since it came out those many years ago
ive beaten it countless dozens of times and the orgasmic pleasure derived from every second of this divine piece of art has yet to decrease in fact it gets greater
every time i select a new attack every time i click to continue the speech tree every second i wander across the beatiful and brilliant landscape waiting for yet another titillating random encounter is an experience that i will treasure for the rest of my life
you have lived and died in vain if you go through your life with out experiencing this unparalelled joybut there is so much more than just joy
the first time that aeris died i i was so stunned that i had a stroke and a heart attack simultaneously while vomiting and pooping myself as the tears streamed down my face
it was so intense that i passed out and slipped into a coma
fortunately my dear friends set up a playstation in my room and placed the controller in my flacid comatose hands allowing me to continue the godly adventure
the serene yet powerful beautiful yet frightening music turned my coma dreams into joyous visions of wonder which made me wish never to awake were it not for my urgent need to complete the mystic questthe combat is a spectacularly intense cerebral affair
the earthshattering visual effects and spells leave me weak and nauseated every time yet i cannot and will not stop no matter the price
words could not attempt to do justice to the intensity of even the calmest final fantasy battlethe story is like no other the spectacular dialogue is an emulsification of the greatest aspects of shakespeare chaucer eliot tennyson donne homer marlow plato aristotle hardy faulkner and joyce rolled into a package so malifluent that each of these great writers would destroy their work from shame
the plot creates a rich tapestry of joy wonder fear and awe that leaves my head spinning my heart pounding my bowels clenching my hair raised my stomach turning and roiling my knees shaking and my extremities cold and shivering while a joyous passion still burns from within
the characters are universal archetypes of every man woman and child yet they are utterly distinct utterly alive chillingly real lovable and erotic to the end
the stoic heroic and christlike cloud stands as a symbol of all that is good and true in humanity earth and all of eternity
the lovable gruff n tumble barret is classic example of the indomitable negro spirit
aeris is a frail flower of beauty and wonder a representation of the loss and sacrifice that inevitably occurs before one reaches the apex of true enlightenment
sephiroth is as black as the deepest pits of hell an embodiment of the satanic ungodly blasphemous and profane forces which seek to crush the frail yet unbending rose of the right
still one as meek as i couldnt hope to analyze all the intricacies metaphors chiasmas similes hyperboles analogies fables and parables which fill up this text which is easily the densest and richest of all known human and alien languagesall the beauty truth meaning wonder significance and interest in all the world are as nothing once you have discovered this hidden treasure
i for one would trade all my remaining days for but one more minute of final fantasy vii inspired pleasure rather than being forced to live a hollow bitter joyless existence without iti got this game right when it came out in  it was  then
and people were literaly fighting in line
when i took it home i began to play play play and play
ive beat it  times and i still wanna go round a few more times
its a great gameenjoy yourselfever since  i got in the habit of beating this at least once a year
i love this game so much that i never get tired of playing it
there are very few games that i fall in love with and have to play over and over
mass effect heavy rain and fable to name a few
the story is great the characters are very memorable and it has one of the best villains out of most of the games ive played
at certain points in the game you actually feel there is no way you can win against a guy like sephiroth and why botheryeah the graphics may be outdated and the characters may be blocky looking but that is no reason not to play this game
the story is great and kept me interested all the way to the end
if you like playing final fantasy but havent tried any of the older ones this is a great place to start
its a stand alone game and has nothing to do with the other ones  even though it is the seventh game
i love it and still plan on beating it at least once a year for as long as i canthe greatest ff is hands down iv
this game offers cutscenes and a story that will keep your eyes glued to the screen until you beat it
the characters are very enjoyable as well
the bosses can get a little tough but if your a hardcore gamer this shouldnt bother you at all
i highly recommend this game even if you are not a fan of the series
this game does take a long time to beat but thats another positive thing this game has to offer as do most ff gamestheres much i could say about this amazing unrivaled classic however ill keep it swift since its infamous status as best ff game ever is worldknownthis is proof of squares original gold standard days before they became square enixneedless to say the final fantasy name is tarnished by recent ff titles that dont even need to be mentioned in this classica review all in all there beth not another grand final fantasy since  a hui kaua final fantasy viilets face it people this is the reason you bought a playstation
its the game that made me buy one
although the game is not without its problems that are irritatingly noticble now a horrible translation bad grammer etc for its time this game was revolutionary
square made great use of fmv technology to progress this very anime like story line
ff vii is one of three titles argued to be the best of them vi vii and viii and is the game that started the rpg revolution that made playstation what it is todaythese days this game is sorely dated and this game should be remade using gcn technlogy
i do not believe that they should make it realistic
idealy id like to see them use toon shading in this remake idea to replace the d monstosities which were featured in the game originally
the original charcter models were inconsistant and largely overly blocky
however the battle scenes and major fmvs offered a whole lot of anime potential
this game needs to be toon shadedoh my god
ive had this game for about  years now and it still kicks a
the plot is amazing and totally unique and never gets old the characters are dynamic and well done the combat system is well thought out and the magic system is much better than that of ffviii
the only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics but when everything else is so amazing who gives a f
the story follows a rebel group known as avalanche as they battle a large evil multinational corporation but as they get closer to bringing it down they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth the greatest villain ever concievedtries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet but amke him an all powerful being
plot twists galore and about  hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experiencei will never get rid of my ff i will hurt somebody who trys to take my ff
thank you for reading my reviewff if youve ever played this game the words send shivers of delight down your spine
squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one
the worlds in trouble thanks to a large corporation shinra who is basically sucking the planet dry of its natural resources
bummer
thats where cloud barrett and tifa oh yeah theres this girl named aeris hint be nice to her at al times come in equipped with huge swords a gunarm gotta get me one of those and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos
the game is a marvel to play and is clearly addictive
the gameplay is perfect with tight controls which respond perfectly an intuitive materia magic sysetm and some kick  bossesprobably one of the best games for rpg players
however too expensive currently as of august 
i bought the pc version and the playstation version years back and still have them
the pc version does look better especially during fight scenes
unfortunately for use on windows xp you have to get a software patch for later in the game chocobo race
great great game
i would say shame on you to the sellers that are charging so much for the games but i understand their reasonsfind it cheap buy it play it enjoy iti realized how much i sucked at rpgs when i beat this game purely by chance but i still love it and think its one of the best games in the franchise
the graphics are horrible but being a game from  you cant really expect them to look much better than the picasso cubic figures that they are
the animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like viii the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal
the story is great and just like the other ff titles the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well
the final fantasy games dont just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and lifei hope square enix believes ffxv is a better game than vii so that it can finally be remade in hd
ffvii is a classic
good luck trying to beat it
crosses fingersaccording the the guiness book of video game records this game is in the top five best selling games for the playstation   that means that it is also the most common
so why why  would this  game used jump to sky high prices
i am guessing that the younger generation wants to see what all the hype was about and that the dvd based on this game did not hurt demand either  either way the game is still awesomereleased in  ffvii is considered one of the best rpgs ever created
here is my review on this masterpiecegraphics  now a lot of the reviewers are complaining that the graphics bite and thus giving it one star
what is wrong with gamers today
all they care about is graphics not gameplay
back then the graphics looked revolutionary
and dont give me any of the oh they sucked even back then
thats not true
just read the back of the box
sure the character designs on the field looked bad but the battle graphics backgrounds and fmvs make these look greatsoundmusic  clash
bang
boom
lots of neat sound effects
as for music well the final boss music is the best piece of music ever
the heavymetal boss theme is coolstory  i dont know why everybody bashes this
it starts out simple then turns complex with many twists and turns and a lot of character developmentgameplay the game is  long
the battle system is awesome
lots of cool manigames
chocobobreeding
lots of swearing
tough optional bosses
i could keep telling you about it but i dont wanna
habuy
buy
buy buy
this is one of the coolest games
best of all its cheap
i can imangine  years from now everybody will still be talking about this game
if you want a feast of music graphics gameplay and spicy language buy thisedit wtfs with the monsters inc coverthis is it
the best game of all time even ff cant stand over this game i did not like rpgs tell i played this game there is no reason not to buy itwell you might lose your job get kicked out of school lose your boygirlfriend because you will do nothing but play this game
and belive me or not i stayed up for a full week to play this game with only a  min brake every  hrs
and i had my parants get me homeschool just so i could play this game more
no im not lieing
buy the gamefinal fantasy vii was a major hit in  it was also the first final fantasy game not to be on a nintendo console
this game has gone on to be without a doubt the most popular final fantasy game if not the most popular jrpg game ever made and with good reasonif i had any complaints about this game its the fact that the graphics while amazing back in  look a bit dated in  which while some of the other final fantasys might look a little jagged around the edges but the have aged better
which isnt the games fought or nothing given that companys where still getting the foot on the ground in the whole d fad in  but it might turn off other players
everyone kinda has a legoie look to them
in the battle scenes however are really detailed and graphically hold up today
now for the music  of the games soundtrack is amazing for a psx game its highly catchy and without the music i doubt the game would have been quite as popular as it is today
with that being said there is a few tracks in the game that are hard to listen to but most of it is greatof coarse the important part about final fantasy is the story and game play
the story without giving out any spoilers for the few that havent played it yet in this game is probably the best we will be able to see in a video game besides final fantasy  and maybe star wars knights of the old republic
what i like about the earlier final fantasy games is that its kinda like reading a book only that your playing and immersed into it
so with that being said i actually preferred this over the newer ones with the voice acting
if your a younger gamer or have kids the may have a hard time getting into a final fantasy game until the have reached the age the can read and perhaps this game can even help them learn or want to learn how to read
also for newcomers of the series you do not need to play any of the previous final fantasys to understand the story
most final fantasys with the exception of the ons that have  on them have nothing to do with one another story wise other than a few minor references here and there so if you just want to play one final fantasy you are invited to do thatgame play wise this game is very similar to the previous final fantasys ivvi with the active time battle
this makes the battles a lot more fun as you can not scroll threw everything all day and get a shower before you make your move
with that being said you do have some time before making a move but you do have to be careful
anyway this is on of the more easier final fantasys although it is still challenging none of the final fantasys while maybe  are casual friendly and this is no different there is a learning curve however if you dont play games much and are sucked into this on you will learn it eventually
just might have to start over a time or toanyway believe it or not despite popular believe this is not the best final fantasy game
now it is on of the best and is the best final fantasy game to get started with since its slightly easier but i would recommend playing threw final fantasy vi as well since after beating vii i discovered more games in the series and found that this game was a lot more fun although similar plus the story of that game completely sucks you in even more than vii does
along with the soundtrack of vi is just as great if not betteranyway even though vi is a better game although a bit more hardcore
vii is still a great follow up for that game and was the game that got me hooked in the series although i did played the first on on the old nes back in the day and is on of the best rpgs ever made anyone into rpgs both western and japanese ones will be happy with this game as long as there willing to sit threw the outdated graphics they will find a very fun and likable game with great characters although this is somewhat where final fantasy started going to stereotypical anime people and a great storyin my opinion this is the greatest playstation game ever released
the storyline is intense and profusely indepth and really grasps you into the storyline which revolves around many characters instead of one
the music is beautiful and many times envokes emotions during parts of the game this game  in my opinion has the greatest musical score
i have noticed people complain about this games graphics well if you have a problem with graphics in an rpgthen i have to say your intellectual level is very low
first of all this games graphics are fineeven compared to the graphics of more recent video game titlesand the game does not revolve around its graphicsthere are many other factors that seperate this game from other rpgs
this game also has the best story in a video game title to date and there are situations that occur during the game that add to the story perfectly
if you want a solid and deep rpg this is for youill keep it short since everyone else said what i willthe goodengaging storylineside quests and minigamesgood soundtrackinteresting charachterscloud aerith and sepheroththats about iteasy to use battle systemi like the materia systemthe badberrethes anoying in every wayocasional typosmusical scores in some areas is annoyingnot so good dialougesome sound effects are annoyingfinal dungeon was rushedthe uglylogging in  hours only to find out your saved file is corruptedalso try final fantasy this game is a three disc rpg turn based game with the best storyline of its time
it revolutionized gaming
it literally has weeks worth of playtime value being that you could sit down and play it for weeks on end straight through non stop and still not do everything there is to do
i absolutely love this game
you find yourself spending so much time playing the characters  that you cant help but care about what happens next which is a big kudos to the writers at squaresoft no squareenix
they really know their stuff
im not going to say what the game is about on the off chance that youve never played it
i would want to spoil it
i will say be prepared for long hours and late night snacks
i dont recommend this to anyone who works long hours at a job or around heavy machinery
you tend to daze off thinking about the game when you arent playingits been called everything from the greatest game of all time to the undeniable peak of an already legendary series
its a big part of the reason sony overtook nintendo and ultimately won the bit chapter of the console wars
and truth be told its single handedly responsible for reviving a passion for video games that had lain dormant within me for years
so cutting to the chase is it worth the hype does it really measure up to those previously mentioned simplistic cherished classics of the bit era can it really be as good as its been portrayed
well yes and no
final fantasy vii is not the best game ive ever played period
what it is well its easily in the top fivethe story basically throws players into the fast lane right off the bat
the opening video montage leads directly into a latenight raid on the planets largest governing body the shinra a raid in which the player is actively a part
as events unfold the point becomes clear youre a mercenary aiding a terrorist organization in their efforts to destroy a significant portion of the city to make a point that the shinra cannot ignore
five minutes into the game and already its covered more mature material than the previous six combined
make no mistake final fantasy vii is not a game youll want to hand your six year old to help him pass some time in front of the tv
not only does it cover some rough psychological terrain mortality semitism terrorism and political espionage are discussed in depth and confronted just to name a few but the characters and dialog themselves arent nearly as squeaky clean as they were in previous installmentswith that said the ingame visuals of ff are very much lacking especially in comparison to later titles
this was obviously a very early release for the rugged psone
edges were extremely jaggedy especially so when not in a battle live renderings of the characters left a lot to be desired and even the cutscenes themselves were compressed poorly leaving huge artifacts all over the glorious video renderings
in sharp contrast though the animation and design of the hundreds of different enemies players items and boss characters is amazing and the variety of static immovable backgrounds are superbly concepted executed and presentedto a much lesser degree than the visuals the musical score is undermined by the medium in which its been presented
this is a soundtrack that would have shaken the earth if it were performed by a master orchestra
unfortunately the difference between a symphonic performance of these classic songs and the spotty digitized portrayal that shipped with ff is as large as the difference between the sketches of the characters themselves and their eventual presentation onscreen
sure youll recognize them without a second glance but theyve been crammed into a format that really cant do them any justiceas has been the case with each new chapter in the final fantasy legacy one new tweak has been thrown into the mix in this case going under the name quotmateriaquot as the game progresses youll find these colorful blocks of concentrated energy be it on the body of a defeated enemy alone in a cave somewhere or for sale in a shop that grant the holder magical abilities
theyre the only way to upgrade your characters abilities and are completely interchangeable between the members of your party
by equipping a block of materia and then defeating enemies the magic quotlevels upquot and gains new abilities while simultaneously strengthening its previous benefits
each weapon and bit of armor you find throughout the game has a slot for the employment of materia which effectively limits the number of them you can use at any one time
youll eventually need to make some tough choices over which materia to develop and which to ignorea lot of players have voiced a strong dislike for the materia system claiming it kills the variety of your characters
the common consensus says that by giving the player the ability to assign any skill or spell to any character square has basically given you a bunch of clones with which to do battle
id have to disagree
if you really want to nitpick and pay attention to the specifics of each characters stats like that youll notice that each character has a different affinity to the various materia commands in the world
sure you can give anybody in your party the ability to cast quotfirequot but its going to cause more damage if you give it to someone with an inherently high magic ability
squares kept the variety in this cast theyve simply given you the ability to ignore each characters strengths and sculpt an army on your own accordthe theory behind final fantasy vii is outstanding yet simple create a game with an untouchable story tremendous characters amazing design mouth watering special effects and great musical accompaniment
it was the right game with the right pop culture appeal at the right moment
it accomplished every single one of its goals and its going to win quotbest video game everquot polls from now until the end of time because of it
what it wont win though is a perfect ten from yours truly
while id be more than happy to go so far as to say the story contained herein is the best of all the final fantasy games i cant say the same for most of the other aspects of the game
the visuals and audibles are hampered by the psones own internal limitations the characters are topped by those of ff and the mini games make me shake my head more than they entertain me
this is very very close to perfection but ive admittedly played a few titles that are betterthat hasnt already been said a million times by a million people
the game is that good  it has without question earned its place among the top  or  all time rpgs to date
i played many before and hundreds since and this is the only game that had me invested enough in a character and a story line that when that character died i dropped my controller in shock and a small tear may have found its way down my cheek
its a game that  especially at the time of its release was just that good
if you have had enough interest you found yourself already at this page and remarkably reading my humble review than all i can tell you isstop reading now and go buy itit is just that damn good
beware on price though
an original black label version can top  in auctions if collecting is your thing  avoid the scammers asking hundreds
depending on current market  to  are about right for the black label ones
if you just want to play it and collecting isnt for you the greatest hits version is more reasonable at  to   its the same game either way and the greatest hits one is a steal in terms of entertainment valuethis is a really good game but its aimed more at rpg lovers than at hardcore gamers
if you are one of those people who simply wont buy anything with a e rating you probably wont like this game
theres nothing obscene about this game except for some minor swearing and sexually suggestive scenesno actual nudity
this is not a game to be rushed through at high speeds
to fully enjoy this game you should delve deep into the hidden aspects of this world and learn more about the story as well as obtaining useful items
many people are spitting on ffviii and ffix because of this game
in my opinion ffvii is better only by a very very slight marginalso i think that there definitely were better games during the time period in which this game came out
zelda ocarina of time was definitely better than ffvii even though it was shorter and the revolutionary goldeneye for n is just as good as ffviidont let those comparisons prevent you from buying this game though
in an industry with so many good games to buycomparison will really get into the way of buying an enjoyable game
buy this before buying ffviii and ffix because its much easier to learn and it will be a nice introduction to how final fantasies on ps workthe game is awesome
the story is memorable almost all of the characters are likable and the game basically becomes more fun as you get closer to the endit two words buy itwhile that alone should be enough i guess ill tell you whythis is the greatest game ever made
it surpasses the mighty metal gear solid commonly thought to be the greatest by a million miles
it also wastes any other ff rpg game movie book anythingive finished it nine times
im yet to be bored
i reckon i never will bethis is my second time playing final fantasy vii and i forgot how perfect it was
everything about this story had such a nostalgic feeling to it
i am really glad i got to replay this game and i hope all gamers give this game a chancepros
the story and the soundtrack are awesome
i really enjoyed the soundtrack this time more then last time because i guess i am older and i feel what the music is expressing with the characters and the mood of the situation as well
the boss fights are fair in this game but i forgot how hard chocobo breeding is lol
i also forgot how hard the ruby and emerald weapon were in this game
i actually like aeris the most in this game
i loved her goofy and flirty personality in this game
she became my favorite character in this game and then i would say nanki was my second favorite lolcons
the graphics are dated but a good story comes before great graphics
final fantasy xiii is prime example of great graphics and a terrible story
a great story is more importantoverall this is great game to pick up again just to see your favorite ff characters 
anybody new to the series i recommend playing this one first or ff game oni have played final fantasy  and although i liked the game overalli also gave it  starsi like final fantasy  much much better
from the moment you pop the first cd in you are nothing but impressed
i wish all games started out the way this one doeswith a bang
you are cloud a selfish newcomer to a resistance group known as avalanche
you dont care about the planet
no way
as soon as this job is done you want to get your cut and split
the dialogue is truly something else
and the storyline wow
the whole idea of a city on a quotplatequot was really original and appealing
great moviesequences
i could go on and on praising this game
even after playing final fantasy  i cant help but go back and play this great game
yeah it is more science fiction than fantasy but it is science fiction done right
although the game is only three cds long the game lasts anywhere from  to  hours
in the first cd you spend  hours in the huge city of midgar alone
then you go on for another  hours or so before going to disc  this game has great music especially the ending boss music
that song is called quotonewinged angelquot
by the way sephiroth is pronounced quotseafeerothquot
at least thats how they pronounce it in the song
speaking of sephiroth hes really cool
definitely the best villian ive ever seen
overall this is either the first or second best rpg ive ever played
first place might go to final fantasy  sure the graphics are way outdated on that game but the storyline more than made up for it
anyway buy final fantasy  right nowthis is one of the most wonderful games ever
it has a great story and really cool characters
this game is really exciting
this is an unforgettable game and i recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a totally awesome rpgthis is the best rpg ever
that just involves you the player
other people will argue that diablo or warcraft are superior
this game offers you a minnimum of  hour of game play
lot of side quests
great story line
and you wont have to divorce your significant other over it because youre playin with some kid on the other side of the country you dont know
graphics are about the best for the era from which the game came from
if you are lookning for a good rpg with a good story this is it
ive had my copy for  years
ever  years or so i just get an itch to play it againi cans say enough about final fantasy vii
even though it is no longer on the cutting edge of rpg games it is still one of the best
the story is very complex and flows very smoothly
the game system is great
the  materia system really works well to customize the game somewhat by  specializing weapons and armours
replay value is  high because its very  intersting to see the different characters
this is definitely a  timesucking game
ive played for hours trying to breed chocobos just to  see whats in some of the quotunreachablequot places
if you own a  playstation you should own final fantasy viithe world of final fantasy vii is waiting to be explored only question is are you ready for ityou play as cloud the serious male protagonist who cannot remember much about his past due to the injection of jenova cells and the fact that hes a wouldbe sephiroth clone
clouds adventures take him to many wonderful sites you have the gold saucer his hometown with beautiful but creep mountains and even the temple of the ancientsplayers will be kept hooked until the finale as meteor crashes down upon earth
the only real turnoff to those who havent played it yet is the graphics but think of this final fantasy vii was made in  so the beauty of viii and ix were but a dreamplay it if you havent already
you wont be disappointedalthough this game is frequently criticized for featuring angsty characters and a large number of anime and video game cliches critics of this games plot should consider that fan perception of the originality of this game has been lessened considerably by the future inclusion of similar character and plot dynamics in the final fantasy series particularly in ffviii and ffx
this video game features truly incredible storytelling and this game should be called cinematic not just because of the inclusion of fmv but because of the large number of visual metaphors expressed in the games visual direction
consider the parallel between the stars in the games opening and the sparks aerith watches shooting out of the open electrical panel or the fact that midgars poor literally live underneath its rich
the lowpolygoncount d presentation of this game gives it a visual style which emphasizes the geometric nature of objects and the producers of the game have changed a technical limitation into a stylistic enhancement
the games usage of light and dark squalor and cleanliness gloom and beauty give it a literary theme of naturalism by representing the products of human technology as ugly
the sweeping theme of final fantasy vii which compliments the wideopen world map prior to the summoning of meteor is first hinted at in holding my thoughts in my heart which plays at the precipice of the dystopian technopolis of midgar
the games various themes communicate the producers vision of which environments represent hell and which represent heaven
even the ironic reallife doublemeaning of finding the promised land is parallelled in the game by shinras misinterpretation of the religion of aeriths race
the game spends a lot of time exploring the identities of the characters of cloud aerith tifa and sephiroth through dreams memories and hallucinations and rather than including definitive conclusive scenes in which the whole truth of the characters are revealed the game challenges you much like a david lynch film to discover the reality of various events by logically reconciling the various perspectives from which they are viewed
this is angsty storytelling at its most beautiful as it challenges the players to make an effort to understand the characters much in the same ways that the game designers would probably like to see more interpersonal understanding within humanitythis game improved upon the limit breaks of ff which could only be used by deliberately keeping the characters at dangerously low hp levels by adding the limit bar and the barrier and mbarrier bars also made combat more interesting leading many players to wonder why they were subsequently removed from the series
some minor design flaws in this game include the threecharacter limit in battle which reduces the players ability to diversify the roles of the heroes and leads the player on a logical level to wonder why the other heroes are unable to participate
also the overavailability of gil makes purchasing weapons and items too easy and minimalizes the usefulness of alternate methods for party growth such as stealing weapons and itemsif the battles as a whole seem too easy in this game it is because the game was designed with the intention of challenging the player to experience it rather than challenging the player to get through it
the game is filled with a variety of fun methods for winning battles from highpowered summons to enemy skills and some otherwise difficult boss battles become unloseable after equipping a specific accessory
part of the coolness of this game is the fact that it was the first major rpg to allow the players to develop extremely poweful heroes by combining abilities such as autoresurrection autohaste multiple counter attacks mp absorbtion and much more
in other words the lack of challenge is largely deliberate and designed to give the players freedom to choose which resources to throw at a particular battle rather than forcing the players to throw everything they have at most battles in order to have a chance for victory
the inessentialbutfun nature of the sidegames such as snowboarding and chocobobreeding mirrors the inessentialbutfun nature of the majority of the special abilities in this game which may be used during battleff vii must also be commended for the distinctively unique visual design of every dungeon and section of the map
walking on the snowy north continent of the overworld leaving footprints in the snow feels completely different than walking in the shadow of midgar and getting lost in previouslyunexplored environments such as the chaoticallymapped great glacier is more of a pleasure than an annoyance
experimenting with different characters and weapons is fun in this game and this is complimented by visual touches which were unique to this game at the time of its release such as showing a different weapon in the battle character models hand depending on what is equippedi played ffi ffiv and ffvi before this game and on my first playthrough of ffvii i mourned the absence of some elements included in ffvi such as multiparty battles and ffvis nonlinear second act but in time i came to realize that in terms of characterization and presentation ffvii is the quintessential final fantasy gamecan it get any better
yes but only with ffx
i love rpg games and ive owened all the ff games from ffv and on the previous ones werent that great in my opinionthose of my friends who dont like playing the game have always wanted me to let them know when im playing it so they can watch
imagine your family watching the game with you instead of nagging you to quotstop playingquot and get a life seriously its  why am i reviewing this game so long after it came out
well because i want to
so there
anyway this game is marvelous i still replay it every once in awhile and it never gets old for me
youd think id get sick of it after awhile but i notice and appreciate something new each time i play it
i personally think this game has aged pretty well and ill continue to play it until my discs break in half
warning this review can be considered to contain spoilers
well mostly just in the story sectiongraphics  well by todays standards the graphics arent so good
however for their time they deserved a  out of   theres something about seeing a character in d albeit rather blocky d that helps you identify more easily with the characters and even though we now have such advanced graphics with current gen systems i still find ff completely playable and not too hard on the eyesmusic   what can i say
the music in this game is both evocative and distinctive
the music fits the scenes and conveys mood very well
this is especially true of the overworld musici feel like the world really is in dire straights whenever i hear it
and let me tell you the first time i heard onewinged angel it put the fear in me consequently i died and had to try again  ha ha
anyway i loved this games music so much i had to buy the soundtrackcharacters  wow
characters are excellently portrayed they all have personalities and some kind of backstory
even yuffie
i mean after playing a certain recent ff  cough ive really come to appreciate the fact that no character in ff is just tacked on to the party cough ffs penelo cough
every single character has a backstory thats relevant or ties into the main story in some waystory  wow
thats all i can say
ff has an amazing intricate network of subplots and character histories on top of the main story
i love the complexity of it
however the one drawback to this complex story is that it requires multiple playthroughs and some thought before you catch everything
to me though this makes the game better not worse
also the pacing of the story is excellent
i never felt bored or compelled to continue just to reach the endplus i love the fact that your main character cloud has a flawed memory spoiler i know but who doesnt know the story of ff by now
because you see the events of the game through his eyes you never quite know what actually happened and  what is the product of his confusion
i believe that having a less than  reliable narrator makes for a much more interesting story for the player because it keeps you guessing
loads of rpgs feature narratorsmain characters with some sort of amnesia but this is one of the few games ive seen that that actually puts a large focus on unreliable narration
some people have complained that ffs story is confusing and poorly told but i strongly disagree
stories in literature that feature unreliable narration edgar allen poe used this alot he doesnt catch any flak for it
are completely legitimate ways of telling a story
in the case of final fantasy  it serves to let the player know in a dynamic and creative way that cloud is possibly psychologically unstable
if you pay attention to the game you might need multiple playthroughs to catch it you can figure out whats really going on
this is in direct contrast to a game that just has a crap story and doesnt make any sense because of poor writing for an example of this sort of game see my grandia iii reviewbattle system  once again i have no complaints here
i absolutely love menudriven combat i know you all are going to laugh at me but i cant be the only one who likes turnbased stuff
i love the materia systemit allows for some good customization which i enjoyed
in many ways the materia system is awesome because it allows you to use any character to do anything which means that no one character is so worthless that you just never use them with the possible exception of aeris since her attack is so lowgameplay  this is my catchall category
the game is just chock full of extras and sidequests
plenty to explore and accomplish
the sidequests are a good balance of combat related things like destroying the weapon monsters and more relaxing noncombat things like racing and breeding chocobos
the controls are easy to use and are rather intuitive
i really have no complaintsoverall  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
personally i cannot recommend this game enough
i realize that it looks rather dated by todays standards but its whats inside that counts right
the core of this game is still gold
ff is like a fine piece of literatureit may be old but its still a classicthere is very little about this game that cant be enjoyed
because of that simple statement and resident fact the game has become an absolute joy and cultural icon in the gaming world
if youve gamed youve heard about ffvii if youve played final fantasies before youve most likely been inundated with information about this ff
ten to one youve probably played it
over and over and over again
and for good reasonif youre a stickler for graphics this is not your game
true there are patches for the computer version that makes the graphics of the characters a bit more bearable but half the charm is the ludicrously sharp angles and style that was just pulling out of bit gaming
the cut scenes for its time were remarkable and had blown our young minds away all those years ago
now however it pales in comparison to what is being put out on next gen software
still if you can look past the blocky animation the game will still blow your mindits a game that you actually go figure have to work at
the easiest route is not always the most accessible and youll spend a lot of time bashing poor cloud the main character into walls trying to find the damn door
on top of that you have to battle beasts that arent going to level up or down with you to present a challenge
they are what they are and if you cant beat them you better be ready to run around the world a couple hundred times leveling yourself and your characters
but the upside to that is the convenience of crap to do
theres a whole world of mini games and side quests that take up a majority of your time and energy
the main story is captivating and you wish to see it to its conclusion but at the same time gold saucer and chocobo breeding might very well make you into an addict
this makes the game in the later hours a bit easy to beat since you might very well grab every summon and every materia known to the planet which will make your characters into walking talking nuclear bombs without the falloutthe characters are all very rounded and all have a depth of story to them that is very typical of final fantasy but they are not loosely connected by coincidence but rather a drive to see the world saved
their reasons are all unique to them and it makes the story as believable as any since we all know what its like to be part of a group that stands for something even if its something small
the antagonist is just as round
sephiroth is as complicated as the rest and will present quite a challenge to you as you progress through the gamethere were many breakthroughs with this game that helped to pave the road for future ffs and separate future rpgs but it makes it no less fun to play because its so called old or outdated
a definite gem worth the time and effort and all kinds of funvery expensive but this game is worth it
for anyone looking to buy it know that the ps has it as an available download for like  bucks
ya its no on a cd like you remeber but hey it saves you some cash
this game is great its a must have game for any true rpg gammerthis game is ahead of its timealways something to learnalways adventure to enjoy
i highly endorse this game
it is one of a kind a classicthis game was truely ground breaking for its time
i cant think of a single rpg for a game console that had so much depth with character development story and optional side quests as this
the graphics and sound were phenominal in their day
any rpg or ff fan should give this game a shotrecommended party  cloud cid and barret youll be laughing like crazyno rpg has come close to having the kind of stories and atmosphere that the final fantasy series has
but no final fantasy game has come close to the timeless masterpiece of final fantasy vii
the characters are superb
i will never forget cloud aeris tifa barrett cid highwind and the others
the story is incredible and the music is classic
sure the sound and graphics dont measure up to ps xbox or gamecube
but this game is above all that
video games have never left as deep an impression on me like this one has
this is the defining title in the final fantasy seriesi dont even know where to begin
this is the game that made me want a playstation in the first place
the storyjeez its better than most books
it has so much so many twists and lots of unexpected surprises that once you finish this great game youll feel proud of yourself and youll go to everyone and say quoti just beat final fantasy 
yesquot  its that good
the fmv is excellent i wouldnt expect anything else for sqaresoft and the music fits the mood
the ingame graphics could use some work
they have blocks for hands and have no mouths but its the graphics are not that important
with battle dont expect this to be a shooter or anything the battle system is called turned based
that means that each character has a meeter and when it fills up they can attack cast magic summon a monster or whatever
one annoying thing about battles is that when you walk around there are too many random battles
one fun thing to do is equiping weapons armor and materia
materia is the magic get to use
its also the summons
the game world is huge
it is
and there is so much to do that the list is nameless and its just like a real world
there is also a place where you can breed chocobos they are giant birds
doing this takes a long time but its very rewarding
thats just one of the things you can do
trust me get this gamethis is the musthave of the series
skip viii get ix and x and throw yourself into the mists of time to rekindle that old flame called final fantasy vii
this game brought the nonhardcore gamers and hardcore gamers together
much like star trek iv did with non trekkies trekkers the cg effects left a mark on the people who played it and introduced final fantasy to the mainstream
i never played any ff before this and wasnt the least bit interested but i tried itthe rest is history
the statue of mario was replaced in 
one last thing dont let the release year fool youvii stands as outstanding graphically as it did then and weaves a tale that will still amazeok  this game is way way way too underrated
whats wrong with everyone
i know the graphics are not as good as any later rpg games
but does that really matter that much
he storyline is an absolute kick too
i cant believe some people dont like it
yeah it might be a little confusing at first but as you put yourself in the game it really gets much better
the good thing about this game is that you can have many different choices and events going on everytime you play it
choose different options the second time you play it and you can get different responses and items
im not gonna say this game is the best bc everyone has different opinions but this game is really a great rpg kick
and all you people who do not agree with me try to stop comparing this game to all these other new rpgs and the later final fantasies that has like perfect graphics and other advanced techs
view this game as a whole new rpg that you have never heard or thought about then maybe you will start to appreciate the beauty of it
this is really a great game i will never regret buying this rpg
and i dont know if you noticed but check the other reviews many of the reviewers do not know how to use the ratings and gave it  star or  stars when they actually intend to give it full stars
so this game is really greater than its ratingafter being on the snes for a number of years nintendo and squaresoft split up and square created its own game console the playstation
and ff just might be the best game ever made for it
ff defined what an rpg should be with an intricate storyline characters with attitude an addictive battle system and everything else that makes an rpg worth playing
this is what rpgs should look play and feel like but it seems like none are as good as this one
the action starts from the very beginning starting with a terrorist group called avalanche on their way to destroy a power plant called a mako reactor which sucks the life out of the planet in order to provide the people of the city midgar with electricity
these reactors are spread across the world and avalanches main goal is to destroy all of them to save the planet
however a creation of the shinra inc company has come back to haunt them a humanoid creature named sephiroth who takes his makofilled disfigured mother to find the promised land and destroy the planet
then cloud a shallow character with a mysterious past and his team must pursue sephiroth in order to save the planet
the storyline then gets even more exciting as other problems arise but youll have to play to figure it out
a good rpg for any game fan this is something youll have to play to believeoverall music storyline characters replay value the greatness of this game doesnt have to be typed
if youve been living under a rock for the past  years let me tell you this game is quite possibly the best in history
new rpg fans must try this classic
this game could play on pswhen it comes to an rpg none can top final fantasy
with quests galore a great story amazing visuals considering the time period and customization that is pretty respectable it still can hold its own against games today
there are even multiple optional characters
yuffie and vincent
for anyone interested in gaming and rpgs this game is a must without a doubtthis game was my first rpg back in the day
i absolutely loved it
i really would love to play it again and im sure this game is overhyped for many that didnt play it back in the day
this game had charm great cg cutscenes and it totally captured me in the last few hours
some say it wouldnt hold up by todays standards and maybe not
but i would love to play it again someday maybe on psn and would love even more a remake done in hdive been an rpg fan ever sincei think that this is the greatest game ever done by squaresoft
i say the weapons were the best part besides the cool equip weapons like speacials ultimate weapons or summons were also pretty cool
i spent many hours on this game but still i never got all the things
i think the most funnest part of it was finding or buying things you neede
the battles were pretty fun too
johni heard people say this game sucks because they say the story is stupid but they dont understand how good of a game this was in its time it was a masterpiece and if you can find a place to buy it from do not resell it this game will be hard to find in the future so its only good to buy it and keep it as a collectors item this is arguably the greatest final fantasy game of all time
some of the best heroes villans story line and character dynamic in video game historyproduct arrived as described and on timefor me this was my first final fantasy experience and i am proud to say this is not only one of my favorite final fantasys its also one of my most favorite rpgs
i dont give vii  stars because its the first final fantasy game i played i give it  stars because it truly is an amazing roller coaster of excitement emotion and even add humor into the mix as well as not being just kid friendly
not only that but it has the one of the most memorable vilians if not the most memorable one sephirothstoryline in vii you play as cloud strife a mercenary for hire
as the game begins you are thrust into battle immediately as you have joined up with a rebel or terrorist if you will group called avolanche who either its members or supporters needs to learn how to spell to blow up a shinra reactor in the city of midgar
shinra is a corporation that is sucking the energy called mako out of the planet which is slowly killing the planet
after this job and the next you end up joining avolanche and pretty much becoming the leader of the group taking over barrets spot
as the story progresses you find out you were a member of a group called soldier shinras elite soldiers and befriending the main villian sephiroth
thats the introduction to vii as i will not go into it any deeper
i will say that the story gets more complex very emotional and has some really good twists along the way
it also deals with more adult themes such as cussing and even some crossdressing to name a fewcharacters square dived in really deep on some characters background and left others barely scratched
cloud and sephiroth have the most character develpment in the game and their storys intertwine quite a bit
as the game progresses though sephiroth and clouds stories start developing on their own and not relying on each others
aeris role and story in the game is probably the most important supporting characters in the game followed closely by red xiii
tifa barret and cid get good stories into their backgrounds and definately add their importance in the story as well
another member is cait sith who you find little about and forces his way into the party
vincent and yuffie are optional characters to have in your party and can easily be missed to get if you arent paying attention assuming you want them in the party in the first place
they dont play much part in the story and have very little background insight on them during the gamecombat system the combat system is developed around whats called materia
its what you need to use magic and can be found after defeating bosses lying around in room or just bought in stores
everything that has to do with fighting is centered around materia from equipping your weapons and items to casting magicits a must to be knowledgeable about how to use your materia and use it properly
your materia also gains experience in battles not by using it though but by equipping it to your armor and items you have equipped on your character
you can also use materia together such as the all and fire materia
you equip it on your weapon or item that has a sideways figure  looking thing on it and when you cast fire you hit all your enemies instead of one
the last thing about materia is once you max out your experience in say your fire materia it reproduces another one starting the new materia experince at  and you now have  fire materias instead of oneyou can also do that to the summon materias too
a few other things about the combat is its an active time battle system which means while your choosing your commands for characters the enemy wont hang around and wait to attack
the last thing is your limit breaks which are special attacks that you get after your anger meter i guess that what you can call it fills up
you can set it to allies getting hit or if that particular character gets hit
there is a lot of materia out there so dont be afraid to mix and match to see what goes with whatgraphics the graphics in this game especially for its time i thought to be simply unbelievable
the random battles are done in d a first that i know of for an rpg to do that on a console system and definately set the bar for rpgs to follow
the cg clips were simply breathtaking at the time but after todays games its hard to believe i thought that when i first played the game
you can tell that they were definitely trying to move past the sprite based characters which they did in battles from the previous games but they just couldnt leap that hurdle until final fantasy viii
the backgrounds were interactive instead of just being completely preset but werent fully d i guess you could call it d interactivemusic music is definitely one thing that can single handedly ruin an rpg such as repetitive fight music and travelling music
this is another area where vii excelled at
sephiroth was given his own theme music one that most players if they heard would identify it in a split second and music at the gold saucer was definitely theme park music
aeris theme was also very memorable and after a certain event in the game upon hearing it you might be caught off guard and you could find yourself tearing up
even orhestras have had concerts where you could find them playing music from vii and even other final fantasy titlesminigames this is one area where square couldve done better
they have many minigames but few of the games are fun like the snowboarding and motorcycle chase
the others were rather boring and got old really quick
the chocobo races were fun but chocobo breeding was time consuming and ultimately a pain to do
the gold chocobo was random in breeding and you could end up reseting you playstation for over an hour trying to get it
i persisted and got mine but the reward was almost not worth the hours slaving over it
just remember if you dont do it you never get to get the knights of the round materia which is the most powerful summon in the gamefinal fantasy vii came from out of nowhere hitting the world like an asteroid sending shockwaves all over the video game nation
it single handedly put rpgs on the map for the nonhardcore gamers and sent hardcore gamers into an rpg frenzy
everyone is entitled to their own opinion but you cant deny that final fantasy vii deserved the hype that it created
it took all the best aspects of rpgs such as the story love story character buildup an easy to use and tactical fighting system and combined d models for its random battles an interactive background and music that has been remembered for over a decade
also having follow up games years later coming out because of the huge fan base
you can say that another rpg would have done it sooner or later but the truth is square put one heck of a game together and they did it firstyou can call me a square fanboy if you want but the truth is im an rpg lover
yes i have played almost all the final fantasy rpgs out there
i have also played the incredible lunar games grandia games xenogears xenosaga legend of legaia legend of dragoon and the list goes on and on to more recent titles on the ps and  the truth is that none of those rpgs shook the foundation of the entire gaming world and turned it completely upside down
even people who hate rpgs hate this game the most out of all the rpgs out there because its the one they had to hear about the mostfinal fantasy vii gets a straight  out of  and deserves more for the bars they broke and limits they pushed
not only that but its characters are timeless and memorable its story is amazing and emotional and the music is like none other for its timei remember back in the old playstation days where final fantasy  was all that you wanted play which is not surprising since this very unique game has a very touching plot graphics that are so very sharp characters that you remembereven  years back from the game its just a solid rpg game that should never be turned downanybody will love this game
continue on to hear details that i remember from ffthe music was amazing
the music from many battles where cloud the main character faces enemies that are in his way lets put it is very powerful and makes your heart race
orchestrated how would you say music composed from a symphonic orchestra just pure classical musicthroughout the entire game
its great
one of the many strong points in this gamecloud the main character starts off in a large urbanized city which you will see once you start the game once you get off the train with that big muscular guy your with
this huge city youre in is defiantly humungous it really is skyscrapers apartments high rise buildings and smokestacks its impressive im telling you and you guessed youre going to have to explore the whole city in this adventure
there will be instances where cloud meets friends in different places as you progress through the gameapartments hospitals highrise towersthe story is very real with characters that respond like in real life
for example i was playing a quarter of the way through the game where we cloud other dude a couple other of clouds friends had to walk up many flights of stairs to the top of this monstrously tall buildingclouds friend gets tired of going up the whole stairway how much longer do we have to go
that was when cloud had to face another chaotic enemy this time on the exterior elevatorhey its challenging but at least you get a good view of the city from a  feet upanother instance is where in this large scientific industry cloud falls off a bridge not a bridge just an overpass to walk on  feet up in the air with his girlfriend shouting for helpa very great movie sequence that i recall vividlyobviously i remember ff very well because this game is like a movie that you as cloud progress through with obstacles battles conflict even love scenes with cloud and his girlfriend dont worrythats nothing compared to todays standards
i tell you without the enthralling and emotional orchestrated music this game would not be so great
but the ff has itmusic that is very suitable for the battleground hideous situations emotional moments and many more instancesoverall this game is spectacular and it will leave an impression on you
this game is that good and im telling you you definitely need to get this gameat a first glance final fantasy vii appears to have boxy graphics lack of special effects and perhaps even a dull storyline with the stoic hero cloud strife
however this game offers so much more than what a quick glance can give
the characters graphics may not be fully detailed but their personalities and body language make up for all of that
each character was thoughtfully created with unique story backgroundand demeanor
unlike many of the final fantasy games one does not get to know the villan as well as the mighty sephiroth on final fantasy vii
i hated him yet felt sorry for him at the same time
to make it an even more intriguing game along side of the storyline and character development the battle system was well constructed
the materia system allowed the player to equip materia magic to their weapons
certain weapons had more materia slots than others  when some materia is linked together such as all and lighting it can create an overall attack on all the enemies versus just one
though some may debate that the graphics sucked one has to understand that this game came out in   graphics six years ago were bound to be worse than what they are nowpros characters that were deeply thought out and well woven into the plota fun and addicting battle systemseveral minigames and great incentives for winningchocobo breeding and racingcons graphics may bother those that are use to newer gamesoverall this game has so much to offer
i am always tempted to replay it because of things i missed such as getting clouds final limit break omnislash or beating ruby and emerald weapon
just twenty minutes into the game i was hooked
it was the first rpg i had ever played and ever since i loved the genrefinal fantasy vii is worth all the five stars i give because i believe it set the standard to the rpgs to followif i dont play this game for a period of time i go through withdrawl and im not kidding
this game features so many epic events and cinematic sequences
you start the game out wondering what its about then you come attatched to it and you cant quit
soon you are one with the game and you understand every little detail and you feel you are cloud strife the main character
from the assault on reactor no
 to the northern cave to save the world from sephiroth this is beautifully thought out and planned
i believe there is not a better game out there
this is the game that made me an official rpg player
i didnt even know what an rpg was before this
my first time playing this was on a japanese demo now out of print and very rareit came with the tobal no
 double package
this demo had final fantasy  demo final fantasy tactics cinematic and bushido blade cinematic
i heard about this game and good things about it so i decided to try it out
i played it and it was very different from the regular game for instance you start out with aerith cloud and barret and magics bolt bolt ice ice demi demi fire fire and leviathan summon
it was the assault on reactor no
 then it ended
i soon became addicted and i played this demo every other day and played it more than tobal by far
i became very intrested in this game and everyday i played the reactor level
i found more and more things and i didnt have enough money to buy it so i had to wait a whole year and finally bought the  disc epic for playstation
now i play it at least every two weeks and i have beaten the game  times and find a new secret and learn something new every time
this game is absolutely amazing
with a fivestar rating and not a fourstar rating in sight you know this has to be a good game and it doesnt lie
i love this game to death and it will soon be out of print so pick your copy up today before it doesfirst let me start off by saying that final fantasy vii was the beginning of the next generation of gamming and im not just talking about ps games im talking about all big games of the present day
ffvii is and was the blueprint for all the next generation games of today
now thats out of the way lets talk about the game
ffvii is still the greatest rpg of all time graphically the game shows its age circa  and the game play isnt exactly the easy movinguser friendly style were used to today but those so called draw backs dont hinder the awesome story the great fantasy atmosphere and the wonderful characters including cloud the quiet and reserved hero of the story and of course sephiroth who is in my opinion the greatest bad guy gamming has ever seen any fan of this game knows what im talking about
im not going to tell you about the story because i dont want to ruin a great experience just take my word for it final fantasy vii is still my favorite video game of all time and if you give this masterpiece a chance you wont be disappointed
five starsafter playing all the us released predecessors to this title i saw the commercials and got actually mixed feelings feeling it would be hard core but not as epic
boy was i wrongthe gameplay matches that of final fantasy vi ffiii in the us but the controller for the playstation adds a new stability element to control
the battle system is very simple any person can win random battles with the clean interface
also the materia system magic system is very user freindly and gives the characters powers that you can almost feel you now posess yourselfto add to this interactive realism is the greatest graphics before resident evil   the prerendered backgrounds are more artistic than most entire games are the battles are cool with cool monsters and amazing spell effects and the cinematics  well just wowto continue this interacive movieaddition to life itself is yet another great soundtrack composed by gamemusic god nobuo uematsu bigger than any other composer name
the music arranges from mysical to energetic from simple to epic and from peaceful to apacalyptic
quotaerisquot quotcidquot quotthe worldquot quotjenovaquot and quotthe one winged angelquot the last battle theme are the best tracks in the game and some of the finest tracks ever devisedto complete this circle squaresoft gave this game a storyline of true epic preportions
while i did tear several times in earlier final fantasy titles i never really cried but when the big plot twist at the end of cd  occurs i still ball my eyes out
never before has emotion and narrative been combined so well into one epic
when done with the game and watching the stunning ending thats beyond description i felt like i just finished a novel one in which was beyond the puny use of words could elaborate
i was in awe and i think anyone who pays attention to this game would be tooi was playing the other final fantasy games and i heard this one was like  of dollers but i find this and i am glad to casue i really wanted to play this
so yeah i am really happy with the item i gotokay as you already know this game has received a greatest hits not for graphics but for gameplay and story
the complete idiots who gave this one star obviously know nothing about real games and they probably spend their time playing final fantasy viii the single worst rpg ever conceived and  is my lucky number toofinal fantasy vii is a phenominal story about an exmercenary soldier named cloud strife joining up with an underground resistance avalanche to help people in the city and stop the evildoers trying to destroy them
later on after hours of nonstop fun gameplay and twists in the storyspoiler hereaeris is stabbed in the back by sephirothspoiler endand that fmv scene is the first and so far the only video game to ever force me to shed a tear
i remember i was  when i got the game and after reaching that part i cried saved shut it off then went to hug my motheras this definately does not match up with final fantasy vi it rivals with the second best rpg ever made final fantasy ii
considering that ffii had more challenge to it but ffvii had a much better story they both beat each other up pretty badlyall in all i would shell out  dollars just to watch someone play it the storyline is so good
the only game that can beat this one story wise is ffvi but this is a really good game with very good gameply even though its a little too easyi recommend you buy this game beat it then get ffvii would first like to begin with a short complaint of those that dislike this game but dont say why
all we ever here from those that hate the game is quotbad graphics bad storyline bad gameplayquot
to be quite honest one should not be writing a review on a game if one does not state reasons why the game is in fact so good or so bad
if you are trying to persuade someone to not like a game then give the facts why something stinks just dont say it does
filling games with bad reveiws just gives a bad rap for no reason for all of you who didnt in fact like this game fill out a review with enough detail to describe what made the game so badanyways enough about bad reviews
this is the first game i played when i got my very first playstation so long ago when they were just coming out
i wasnt a gamer then but this game turned me into one
final fantasy  must be the best game i have ever played
if you think about it the games graphics were amazing considering the time it was introduced
i am still amazed today with the battle effects and cut scenes
simply exceptional
the gameplay well to say in short is wonderful
the game does an excellent job drawing the player into the storyline and making the player feel like he or she is part of the game
i must have replayed this game over  times each time finding new things
the fmv sequences are amazing and cannot be beaten
there are too many people that state the game has bad graphics the final fantasy series in itself has always had a cartoonish side to things so i do not understand why anyone would say the graphics are bad
sure we all have our playstation s and saw how amazing final fantasy x looked but keep in mind the time final fantasy  was brought out
also the music is amazing
when aeris died the situation and music almost made me cry
then the battle afterwards had you so mad that you felt like pummeling genova with everything you had
which is what most didanyways rather than subject this review with every little detail of the game i will simply state the game rocks because it is so innovative so drawing and so damn good just plain and simple
a must have for any gamerfinal fantasy  is still my favorite even tho i am currently wrapped up in final fantasy  but thats a different gameby this game and see yourself how wondrous it islet me get this out of the way i came late to final fantasy vii
i played final fantasy adventure on the original game boy as a kid and now that ive grown up into a gamer i figured id better go back and play some of the classics and ffvii was near the top of every list i could think of
so this review will be free of nostalgia since i didnt ever play the game before two months agoif youre reading this i assume you know the basics this is an rpg the first d final fantasy et cetera
im also going to take for granted that you realize that is game is over a decade old and as such its a liitle unfair to compare it to todays games though it has aged remarkably wellthis is an original playstation title so it will play on your ps where its also available as a download from the psn and your ps
you will only be able to save it on the ps if you have a ps memory card
i dont own a ps so i cant vouch for its saving capabilityyoure tossed into the action from the moment you start the game this becomes a plot device later actually
that made me wonder about if the game would be lacking in any kind of noncharactermodel cutscenes but i was soon proven wrong the cutscenes are beautiful even by todays standardsthe combat system uses whats called the active time battle atb system a decent blend of turnbased and realtime
each character has a time bar and when it fills you input a command
commands are executed one at a time in the order they were chosen
bars fill up during selection and sometimes during the execution depending on the action giving an element of realtime
i had a gripe with this system as the game went on as trying to locate one of the hundred or so items on my list was getting my characters hurt but the feature can be turned off without penalty in the menuthe story is pleasingly deep both in the main storyline as well as individual storylines for each character
the list of items and equipment is extensive
there is also an extremely high replay value for a singleplayer game as the world is so vast the items so plentiful and the rewards for sidequesting high including yuffie and vincent two party characters and a wealth of exclusive items usually materia used to cast magic add a buff or add extra abilities or limit items which give characters a sort of ultra attackthough few and minor the game does have its flaws
perhaps the most glaring is the lack of save points you only get one in the final level which is pretty bad considering how devastating a lot of the enemies are
the game usually is portrayed as d character running around on what appears to be a d matte painting it looks beautiful but occasionally is hard to figure out whats a path or exit and what isntall told though the gripes are far outweighed by the quality of the game
yes this game is a classic for a reason
if you have ever played an rpg and liked it give ffvii a try
i did and now im a believeri got this game  years ago and couldnt stand it
only played it for about  minutes
i thought i was reading a book not playing a video game so i gave it away
 years later i played crisis core final fantasy  for the psp and thought wow this is a good story so i decided to play the original final fantasy  to my surprise it was selling for well over  dollars then i thought this must be a really good game
come to find out this is a true masterpiece after playing it i am hooked on final fantasy they have such a wonderfully story the graphics are always state of the art
and they are timeless treasures you can come back to even  years and say wowfor all gamers out there this is an excellent game to get
it is a role playing game takes you around clouds you world and you battle monsters and evil things
you meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end
the graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in final fantasy viii
it kept me entertained for quite a while
i have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do
but your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game
jordanthanks of final fantasy product give a series of game that kid enjoy for hours in a different kind of wordyes i said one of the best games ever made but not the best
this game falls right behind xenogears
you probably havent played it since its very hard to get
but its definently in my opinnion the best game ever and if u have the chance then get it
anyways ff has great graphics but the character models are totally ugly
the backrounds are very nice though and so are the fmvsthe gameplay is fun and addicting except the battle system
why is it that every final fantasy game has had a completely boring battle system
why cant they make them like xenogears
xenogears had a very very great and fun battle system
with battles like this in ff youll always be wishing not to run into a enemythe sound is perfectthe controls are easythis game is great period
and if you havent bought it yet then you are insanebesides xenogears no game comes close to thisthis game is excellent
even more so for beginners or people whove never played a final fantasy game before
the battle system is pretty easy and the equipment and command systems arent hard to get either
the storyline is deep and memorable too which is definitely a plus
you definitely wont regret picking this game upi spent pretty much a whole mounth of my life just playin this game and i dont regret it
this game is just so intence it pretty much starts to rub off on you a lil bit
the story is very deep and even change a lil depending on how you play the game
alas theyre are people who should never play this game ever
i like to call these people morons because all they can do while playing this is complain about the graphics
people need to look beyond graphics to see weather are not its worth playingexcellently plotted and paced ff features several welldeveloped characters event the minor characters get some character development a very welldeveloped villain plenty of optional quests and things to do off the main quest and a great scorethe plot unfolds throughout the game picking up its pace toward the end but not falling prey to the common problem of tying up all the plot threads in two minutes
its wellpaced the plot twists arising out of the characters and situations as presented and nothing really shows up as a deus ex machina except for the bit with the blasted snake the characters are generally welldeveloped  while the three main characters get most of the development each of the other characters including the optional ones get a few scenes with insight into their actions or their pasts
these characters also have reasons to be working together rather than just thrown together haphazardly
the female characters are excellent though aeris is just a bit too perkythe villain is excellent wellhandled and welldeveloped
the lesser villains and some of the other npcs also get a bit of character development the optional quest in wutai with the turks has to be one of my favorite bits in the game and the villains actions make sense within the contextthe materia system is complicated
expect to spend some time fussing with it to understand how it works
this is not necessarily a negative mindthe music is great
from what i understand its a distinct departure from the earlier games but i havent played them
there are a few mediocre pieces such as honeybee manor but the truly excellent pieces such as the turks theme nightmares beginning vincents theme and onewinged angel final battle music more than make up for them and there are no truly annoying goddontplaythissongagain pieces in itthe only real problem i have with this game is that the fmvs cant be skipped theres only so many times you can watch the thing with the gondola  and that the last battle especially if youve done the optional quests is too easyif youve never played an rpg before this one will spoil you rotten
this is where i really started and ive been trying to find stuff like this one ever since
if youre new at this stuff but would like to nestle inside of a safe nonthreatening experience in the rpg realm look no further
this is the cadillac of rpgs
its easy to play gives you ample opportunity for increasing your skills and really touches base with many gaming experiences including fighting racing puzzlesolving strategizing etci dont even know where to start
i played this game once when it when it just came out and once recenlty
the game is just breathe taking
even with all the kick ass graphics out today they are still no match for this game
i almost shedded a tear when a ceratin someone died
the rpgs in this game are decent compared to what is out there today
but remeber this game came out when psx just game out
at the beginning you are a rebel named cloud strife rebeling against shinra corp in a city called midgar
as you progress in the story you get invovled with clouds past and he finds out revalations he never knew about himself
i palyed this game for  hours and i never got sick of it
if you have never played this game i suggest you get it
its the best game i have ever played
this game had the most profits in squaresoft history
only a playstation game could be this good
nothin xbox would ever havethe game starts when you are cloud a shinra inc soldier and you quit and join a team of mercenaries called avalanche
they want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town
you will fight in over  battles with monsters and hard bosses
you will have a long journey to finally reach your goal to kill seperoth for all people
he was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing
his artificial mother or not real mother jenova is someone you must kill
she is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game
seprioth is the enemy you wont find that out until later in the game
i dont want to spoil the game but its the best game ever madei dont know where to even begin my praises for ff because everything about it is exceptional
the graphics are probably the first thing one should notice
the characters look much like blocks of polygons but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the fms are seamless
the music is orchestral and extremely emotional  aeriss theme is my favorite but one cant forget one winged angel which really heightened the feeling of the final battlebut my favorite part is the plot
in its complexity it is beautiful  there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once
it talks so much of selfsacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause of selfdoubt and selfsearching of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds
the characters lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the futurethis is my favorite video game
i still remember seeing the preview for it on tv an evil empire is sucking the life force from the planet destroying all thats in its path
its up to one soldier of fortune to save the world
if he succeeds you survive
if he fails you can always hit the reset button
after the game came out it was months before i could afford it
it was worth it
over a decade later no game has come close in meaning as much to me as this onethe story has a grownup realistic tone to it
contrary to the old television preview it is not an evil empire or kingdom that has taken over the world but a corporation shinra electric power company
the world is technologically advanced
the heroes sit at bars and ride trains and watch television
but it is also a world where magic is possible
some of your characters use guns some use sorcery or martial arts and of course cloud wields his famously massive sword and because of terrific worldbuilding you can buy into the conceit with ease
of course cloud uses a sword in a world with guns and laser beams
hes a supersoldier created in a complicated combination of magical infusion and injection with the cells of an alien being so hes strong and fast enough that a sword is more useful to him than a gun
the journey of the games heroes through the world is nothing short of epic
i still have fond memories of the places i traveled to in this game the slums of midgar the temple of the ancients rocket town the gold saucer even the lost city of the ancientsthis game almost made me cry
thats how beloved its characters are
sephiroth is the greatest villain of any game
one of my favorite moments in the game is when the heroes had to cross a swamp where a giant snake lived
when they tried to fight the thing it defeated all of them with ease so the heroes had to ride across the swamp on steeds so they could outrun it instead of fighting it
and on the other side of the swamp liesthe cut up corpse of the same kind of giant snake
sephiroth took it out singlehandedly
aeris is just a beautiful character a purehearted girl raised in the slums but born with a special connection to the planets life force
and cloud is the coolest of heroes
hes noble a little bit cocky and kind of psychologically messed up with his repressed memories and all
and when you find out the truth about his pastthat just makes him cooler in my opinionthere are moments in this game that will stay with you forever
they are iconic
if youve played the game you know what i mean
seeing sephiroth destroy clouds hometown comes to mind
hes standing in the fire unharmed and their eyes meet for a moment then he turns and strides casually through the flames
and that spooky music is playing those chosen by the planet with its bells tolling  or when a main character dies the moment that nearly made meand a lot of other peoplecry at a video game then that music plays
on that note the music in this game is pitch perfect
the tense rocking music for the boss battles the creepy alien music when the heroes encounter jenova or parts of her the absolutely beautiful aeris theme
and the exultant darkly emotional one winged angel which plays during the games climax is awesomeso there you have it
video games greatest hero and villain all in one place
the coolest world combining science sorcery robot cats and even a rocket ship
music that will haunt you
an epic story about life and humanitys place in it
characters that feel more like friends
i keep waiting for a game to come along that will match this one and ive played many games since
if you have never played this before then dont let the outdated graphics scare you away i remember how impressed i was with them at the time
even now its still worth itthis is my favorite old game
this game can take well beyond  hours of game play
many side quest like raising choco bos for racing
the best part for kids is that they have to read all the dialog
lots of good cinemasa classic for anybody who still has a playstation or a playstation  this game is pretty freakin awesome
not going to spoil anything but you should play it if you havent alreadythis is possibly the best game i have ever played besides the upcoming mgs if you are a gamefan and dont haveb this game you outa be ishamed of your self
go buy it lowly maggotfinal fantasy vii was the first release for the playstation and the advance in graphics and gameplay brought new popularity to this great seriesyou play as cloud a member of a team of environmental bandits
this rebel group is trying to stop shinra an evil corporation from stealing all of the planets energy makothe leap in graphics between final fantasy vi and this one is pretty amazing
where ff was a d game with  bit graphics this one was fully rendered d graphics
you move your polygonal character through a richly painted mural of a world
the sound quality is also much betteralong the way cloud is joined by barret who looks and talks like mr t from the a team
tifa lockheart and aeris gainsborough also join him  both are characters that are found on the ffdisney blend kingdom heartsof course there is a wedge and biggs named after the star wars characters
in fact one of biggs early lines is almost straight from the movie
theres a cid too  hes an airship pilot
this is the cid they used in kingdom heartsfinally you reach and meet sepiroth and his many forms
the game is very rewarding to play even though its graphics have been surpassed by later versions of final fantasythe highest grossing final fantasy game and still beating out other final fantasy sales on the psn
one who cannot understand the complexity maturity imagination and heart that went into its story would be the kind to give it a rating of one or even be foolish enough to compare it to final fantasy viokay enough of the overly smug and satirical comments
it is entirely subjective what people think of any final fantasy game but what is objective is that it is the best selling final fantasy game to date refer to the following website for further proof if you need a reference the sales of this game will continue to rise with steam support and it is well worth its place in the number one spot
i have tried other final fantasy games because of vii and not found them as impressive based on their rpg elements of leveling up materia upgrading weapons and limit breakscomparing vii to ix you will be frustrated that if your character goes into trance mode which is the limit break of vii just before a different character kills the last remaining enemy then that is a trance gone wasted
in final fantasy vii you can hold on to that limit break until you face the next boss
i understand that viii does the same but i cannot stand its gil earnings system card mechanics or even characters
cloud is a complex and confused character but hes not a total dck like squall
aeris is a character you care for immediately red xiis personal story involving his father will bring tears to your eyes cids rekindling his view of shera changes him as a person even yuffies story with her hometown and father is relatable despite the little punk stealing your materia
the way i review games is based on their performance as a game such as what you find annoying about certain games and how the usual mechanics fair for this one
without further ado allow me to break it down objectivelycamera many games these days suffer camera issues that are downright unbearable but final fantasy viis camera is always placed in the right overhead area and for some levels at in a nice side scrolling style
you can customize how you want the camera to behave during battle sequences and you can even control the camera while on the world map
the camera here is perfect with no complaintsgraphics the graphics are not even that of the typical playstation format but not in a bad way
it still hangs on to its roots during story sequences but during the battles they change entirely to appear more anime inspired and the cutscenes may seem dated are still decent even for today
its late old school gaming at its best which helps you harken back to when what mattered most was thegameplay addicting to say the least
having trouble putting down the controller until you can leave midgar
no one is judging you here
the game mechanics are flawless in what they provide in terms of gameplay
sure you could always add more but why fix what isnt broken in this masterpiece
grinding might seem a little annoying but its not about leveling your character up to be twice as strong as the end level boss
the battles are all about strategy which is understandable why many dont comprehend that
you level up your character level up materia swap items prepare accessories and weapons earn proper amounts of gil from battles sell mastered materia find stronger weapons and armor mingle with townsfolk decide how you want to treat an ally breed and race chocobos go on mini side quests partake in a few hilarious main quests and all of it feels rewarding
the replayability is on high for this because you can always go back and make different choices in another playthrough or just relive the story and imagination
one disc wasnt enough to pack such massive gameplay as it required a full three for the mighty playstation hardware
dont think you have beaten the game if you havent beaten emerald or ruby weapon either
it doesnt end with just sephirothstory this may be the first game where i add story into the review as the story is its own character in the game
every character has an emotional background even the optional characters of vincent and yuffie
what happens to aeris is not groundbreaking even for a final fantasy game but her lacking presence is felt as you journey deeper into the promised land hoping to thwart sephiroth at the reunion for what he has done
yuffies teen angst is terribly relatable despite her annoying dialogue and even red xiiis mistaken view of his father is met with goosebumps
even the hard shelled barret has his past come back to haunt him that must be faced
its stories that are all wrapped up into one incredible story as you journey to save the planet from being destroyed at the hands of a god in the making
step aside kefka sephiroth is no laughing mattercontrols the controls are completely flawless and perfectly responsive
any game with perfect controls are completely playable based off that reason alone but final fantasy vii utilized your controls in different ways many times so you gain the most from your experience
you snowboard defend your allies by motorcycle ride and race chocobos fly the greatest airship in the final fantasy series and battle intimidating monsters
still the controls are a small part of what consists of this legendary gamesound the regular sound effects again take you back to the old school final fantasy days but the music is without incomparable
from when the game first kicks off in midgar to when you first meet aeris to the excitement of the gold saucer to the dramatic confrontation red xiii has with what is left of his father to the final confrontation with sephiroth
every tune strikes a chord that will last forever and is ingeniously constructed as well as perfectly fitting
no final fantasy game sounds as pleasant and that isnt based off of just nostalgia
the music is perfect for listening to outside the game with melodies that will bring you back to your first experiencesin conclusion words do not do this game justice
play for yourself especially if you need to catch up on classic final fantasy games now that theyre going the annoying subscription fee route
enjoy what brought this series to its success and make sephiroth payi love the story in this game the battle systemmusicjust everything about this game is good yes the graphics are are bad but i dont care because its the first d one they did and second its an old game so i would just like to say by this game you will spend hours playing itfun to playgood musicgreat storyall around fantastic gameits would be nice to see it in high def on the ps thoughremaketitle says it all
the final fantasy games that followed this one just werent anywhere near as good
everything about this game is pure goldi wouldnt advise anyone to pay hundreds of dollars for this game when you can get it at gamestop for only dont be fooledthis is official now as psone classicscheck out your playstation account and get onerecently threw this into the ps and revisited what i consider to be not only the best rpg but the best game of all times aeris
all i gotta say
dbooooo yeahbest game ive played
if you like action adventure this is the best game for it
it is sooooo cool the movies are pretty cool also weapon a monster it looks awsome
this game is totally the best best graphics it is just too cool
no blood so parents no fear for children just violence
i recomend this game to everyone
no need to rent buy it while you still can
i cant for one to good of a game i guessyup another game for the kids they really liked this one too
this is played quite a bit and still workingi have been a fan of the final fantasy series since it first came to the us for the nes
this is yet another great game in the series
it has great graphics for its time
it has a very involving story with a lot of plot turns and it has a lot of likable characters that you actually would like to learn more about as the story unfolds
i would recommend this game for anyone that is into scifi fantasy and rpgsfinal fantasy vii in my opinion is the best rpg game ever created and it definately blows away the others that have followed
the graphics are not as good as the ones that followed but one has to think of when this game came out
the story was supurb music was great and theres not too many villians like sephiroth
it took me many many hours to beat this and many days at work struggling to stay awake from staying up all night playing
not too many games have kept my interest like this one did my life wouldnt have been complete if i didnt beat this game
most that like this type of games know what im talking about but to those who havent played this should check it out
this is definately the break through game that changed rpg games foreverwhen i first played this game i was stunned
this game is the basis for any rpg ever put into circulation
there is no way you cannot be moved by the storyplot
the characters in this game have a one of the gratest personality that any rpg game can offer
the scoresoundtack of this game is one of the bests ever put into an rpg because it sets the tone for thisin order to play this game you need to have a mind that can understand the reality of the game and i mean that in a good way
even if youre not into rpgs any true playstation gamer should own a copy because it is a miracle
this game is one for the booksi have beaten this game one time and frickien think this game dominates the rpg section if you are bored and want a very good rpg to play then get final fantasy  it will blow your mind out  this gamen will give u plenty of time before u finally get to the end this game is pretty long thats all  also for help on this game go  for information on it i can surely expect my website to help u beat final fantasy i bought this game back when ps was the new system
i had never played an rpg before and ff was recommended to me by a friend
first night playing i out in  hours i was floored to say the least
everything about the game was great the battle system story length difficulty i love the materia system and overall i have not one bad thing to say about this amazing game
there is nothing else like it ive looked
no other final fantasy even comes close and ive played and beat every single one
in my opinion to date this is the single greatest game ever made and a must have for any rpg fan
i really cant believe the people who gave this game  star
such people are fools and not true gamers in any way
buy the game you wont regret itits been a decade since this game has been released  all i can say is wow
this game gets soo much praise and well blasphemy too  even has been hailed as quite possibly the greatest game ever made however thats not possible only to those who think this is the greatest game ever made
but i urge people to try this game out despite the outdated graphics  no voice oversyou start off as a mercenary an exsoldier named cloud who is working with a group named avalanche a team of members who infiltrates shinras biggest mako city midgar
mako is destroying the planet  avalanche known as hippies or treehuggers is trying to stop that from happening
what cloud doesnt realize is hes closer to shinra then he thinks
and a mysterious man known as sephiroth suddenly attacks midgar after a tragic event that took place incrisis core final fantasy viicloud must search for this man as he deals with shinra  the turks
all while he tries not to lose his sanityok in my opinion the best way to uncover this story is to play the first half of crisis core until you reach nibelheim then start playing ffvii this game until after you get past the part where you find out about zack
then go back to crisis core beat that then finish ffvii
it doesnt really matter what game you play first  vise versa but if you play this game all the way through it pretty much spoils the ending for crisis core
although i still think it was exciting to see the ending in higher graphic quality i just knew what was going to happenanyways on with the reviewstory the story for this game is superb although it lacks a few minor details that not even crisis core reveals it still has one of my favorite storylines in the entire history of videogames or movies
i do recommend you play this game before crisis core before nibelheim just because crisis core reveals what really happens to cloud  then this game wont really keep you interested
besides that though i really think this game is still considered one of the bestgraphics the graphics for this game was superb when it first came out
no one still really cared too much about them yet  square really showed them off for this game this game was originally in production for the n except for the fact that you have blocks as hands
i believe the main game for the n wasnt completely scrapped as they were trying to make this for that system but then realized the potential of having cg clips for the playstation they went with that system instead
so for those wondering why the graphics look so cartoony in this one im pretty sure thats your answer
the cg movies still look amazing for the ps granted that square got better at it with ffviii
either way square is trying to get the original team from this game to pull off a grand remake to make this game look really nice which is still in question however they have other games theyre working on nowgameplay well lets just say that its not hard but its not easy of course the actual battles are fairly simple if you know what your doing
and leveling up your characters  materia are the only main factors you have to worry about in progressing in the game
the problem with moving your character around is that your fumbling around with the directional sometimes because its not quite calibrated right
or its just the camera view however its annoying at timesmusicsound i enjoyed the music from this game i still think its one of the best ones square did
everything from the bombing mission to cids theme this game has it done perfectly
another good reason why square wanted this game on the playstation crystal clear stereo soundconcept while it took me several times to go through the game and beat it which for some people who dont understand the story will have to play it through a few times
the thing that people get most confused on is the materia setup
while it was easy for me to grasp some people were like huh
its like trying to teach a cat how to drive
i thought this concept was easier then some of the ff games that came out after this one
but yet again easy for some hard for othersreplay value personally i think this game should have had a new game function where you can go through the game again with stats materia items ect
but maybe if square gets a remake going theyll throw that function in
only because i never get tired of this game  its one game that does deserve a remakeoverall i did give this a full  star rating only because i still think this game is the best despite its problems
and for those who havent yet check out crisis core as well great prequel to this gamethis is the nd bess final fantasy in the entire series
only final fantasy  us beats this
the story is absolutely the best in the series next to ff
it is sad and exciting
this is definately a halloffamer in the game world final fantasy  brought a brand new battle system by using  materia
it made all gamers want to play it over and over again
while some battles can be tough the game is  magificent
the additon of the tough american monsters gives even the best rpg gamer a hard time
if there was one thing i would have asked for about the game i would have wanted to be able to play has sephiroth
just looking at him its a wonder you could beat him
unless you have knights of the round  the game is good and i would reccomend it to every rpg gamer out therei having been playing role playing games steadily since nintendo and sega master system
and this is the best role playing game i have played with phantasy star of master system a close nd
i am only on disc one still but i cant stop playing this game i have to finish it i just bought ffix after reading a review on ffviii i decided to pass but may go back if someone can change my mindfinal fantasy  is one of the greatest playstation games
it is better than final fantasy  because of its story
final fantasy is a great time if you are looking for something that will keep you happy till you get a playstation   this game is one of the bestbest characters and storyline iv ever playedplot twistsgreat character developmentthis game does everything right cloudthe main character is a bad ass manley mandespite the fatc it probaly takes him  hours in the morning to do his hairbut hes cool none the lessbarret a black guy who is also manley and has a really bad tempertifahuge boobies wears short shorts and is probaly really pretty if the graphics were betteroh and shes nice and obviously wants to get into clouds pantsaeris a good girl who probaly shouldnt stand under balconys or anything somebody can jump on top of her cid foulmouth badassthis game has a lot of bad assesred xiii plays the role of the wise old manthough hes not a man and techinically in his years hes onky a teenagerget this gameull love itif u like rpgs ull love this game and follow it like a religionthis game is truly the best game i ever played on the playstation game console
the character designperfect the mapperfect the storyperfect this is the greatest games ever made by square soft are this game and close behind is chrono trigger which you can get in a joint package with final fantasy another very well made square soft game and very much worth buyinglateris final fantasy  really the best one out of them all
to me yes to the fans yes according to squareenix double yes
this is the companies most cherished and prized game
so much so that they are too afraid to disturb it in any way and have said so openly
but a remake is not lost remember the  ps tech demo
gamers we have a voice if we want this to happen we need to be heard any way possible
look at how fast microsoft removed their xbox one digital downloads only scheme when we united
keep at telling squareenix to remake this game any way possible
the day will come
then well just need to bug sony about legend of dragoon nextanywho one of my favorite games
unless final fantasy  ends up being better its a long shot though
graphics can only take a game so fari remember all the hype surrounding final fantasy vii when it was set to be released
gamepro had allready said it may be the greatest game ever made and that itself is quite a title
i never really liked rpgs im more of an action gamer but with all the hype surrounding this game i figured what the heck and rented it a few days after it came out
i was dumbfounded the first time i played it i was speachless
at the time i had never seen graphics like that and the storyline was so engrossing that i felt a wave of depression actually set over me when i had to take it back
as pathetic as that sounds the day i returned it to the video store i went out and bought final fantasy vii and kept playing for days
eventually i beat it then a buddy of mine showed me his strategy guide and i realized i missed a lot of side stuff and extras so i played through again using the guide and the experience was even better
if you have never played any final fantasy game before this one is worth picking up even if you dont like rpgs youll dig this though i suggest picking up the bradygames strategy guide to make the game even sweeter
truly one of the greatest games ever madethe abdominal escapade rpg game final fantasy vii
quite possibly the most excellent final fantasy ever in a lot of peoples minds
i will agree that this game is extremely great and square deserves every bit of credit
it has its ups and downs just like every other game out there
i really do like everything about this game but i do like the other final fantasys out there
so if you have only played this game i suggest you try the other final fantasys that have been releasedif the intro made you mad then im sure that the rest of the review will make you happy
starting out as a former member of soldier you take the main role of cloud
you start out with a rebellion group by the name of avalanche and dont forget it
your inaugural mission is to blow up the reactor to get the attention of shinra inc to let them know they are ruining the planet by having these mako reactors
so make your point grab your huge sword and let the adventure beginstory every body who has played this game knows that the story line is what makes ffvii live up to its title
you are an ex soldier member and joined a group called avalance to stop shinra the bad guys from using all the energy from the planet
why
because stealing stuff from the planet is not good thats why
on your way from destroying a mako reactor steals energy you run into a pretty flower girl
that whose name i will not say its a secret
one of your beginning characters is barret who is the leader of avalanche and with him is tifa who runs the bar they all hide at and she also watches his daughter marlene
cloud use to live with tifa in their town called nibelheim surprised to see cloud she runs up to him and asks him how he has been over the past  years since they have seen each otherstarting out kind of fast you will notice the game makes a more pace able progress in the story line
the story isnt as long as xenogears but at least you will understand what is going on if you might happen to miss something earlier
even on my th or so time going through the game i still just go through for the story and the game play but for the most part the story
you have a main villain of course and he goes by the name of sephiroth
you will meet all kinds of exciting characters and go to new towns that are perfectly designed
like any other story there are sad times and the good times but we all want to remember the good times
as we all know the story is one of the best and it keeps you coming back for more
if they just made this game a book it would definitely be on the top  list in no time
that is how good the story is its hard to put into words how much you should like it
so just enjoy and move on with the gamegame play the battling system is as normal as any other final fantasy
you attack the enemy they attack you heal and use magic all of those good things
at least they dont have the same boss music over and over
some of the bosses even have dialog in your battles nothing too major just a grunt or two about how they dont like you and they think that they are going to win the battle
the magic is the basic elements plus your non elementals
there are summons to use which have extraordinary graphics and a lot of them are just cool looking
the bosses have certain types of skills that you can use by getting a certain materia called enemy skill all you have to do is wait for them to use the move and your character absorbs the move into there little materia for later use
the materia is what contains your magic and special techniques
it can have magic all the way to your little friends called the summons
each of the first couple of summons they are elemental too such as ifrit he is a fire based monster
along with shiva whom is an ice based monster
they all have their own special move that will help you in each of your battlesthere is also a little feature called limit breaks
so if you ever get tired of using summonings or using magic use one of these
when that little red bar fills up you use that limit skill and blow those enemies away
each character has  levels limit breaks except for one of them
and when you do a certain amount of using one limit you can get the next extravagant limit
with the first  levels of limit breaks there are two in each one
but the forth level of limits is the ultimate which you might have to work youre butt off to get that special item
so there is a lot to keep up with in the game play make sure you dont forget to check for items hidden in secret places when it comes to fighting every item you find will helpgraphics being the best graphics of this time of gaming ffvii tops it all
to start off the characters have no mouths which is ok at least its better than having no faces at all like the grand stream saga
but we will continue on with this game
the magic has ok graphics at the beginning but as you get stronger magic the graphics glint every where all over the screen
each element of magic fire thunder earth ice are the major ones has  levels and each graphic is bigger each time and can grow even larger when youre fighting multiple enemies and use it on all of them
the summonings probably are the better detailed of graphics when it comes to battles
there are sixteen bundles of joy waiting for you in the wonderful world out there
each one you summon has there own special element or nonelement attack when you summon themthe graphics can be very beautiful the first hundred times that you summon them but after a while they can get exasperating of seeing them do the same thing over and over again
now on to the videos each video is really greatly detailed
the characters and the surroundings are spectacular they have mouths in the videos they actually move to the words but you dont hear them unfortunately
you can tell they tried not to get too detailed with the characters so they wouldnt look nothing like they do in the game but they basically paint the picture for what they would look like if the game had better graphics
the limit breaks as i mentioned earlier have really sole graphics for each one of them
the limits seem to actually fit the characters look such as cloud he will use his sword and completely ruin everything around him
barret will use his handgun to blow away the enemies with ammunition
each character has graphics to go with them and fit their attitude and square really did a good job emphasizing on their details
with ever bit of effort they put into the graphics they really deserve all of the love from everyonesound one of nobuo uematsus best works in music ever
this is definitely a buy worthy soundtrack
if you do not own the game or the soundtrack i suggest you save up some money and get both of them right after you get through reading my review
each song fits with the surroundings perfectly the best part is when you listen to the song by itself then it will remind you of when you were in that specific area or a certain video in the game
i believe if music can do that than it is how the title music is deserved
while talking about the music the sounds that characters and monsters make are special in their own way too
unfortunately as i mentioned earlier the characters talk in videos but there is no sound
so pft to them
but i am sure that you can tell from the dialog when the character may be excited or very angrythe magic and summons have sounds to them also
when you have a larger leveled magic the sound lasts longer
because the bigger the magic the longer it takes to finish its use
each of the summons makes a noise when they perform their duties
such as when ifrit sets out his meteor fire ball i am sure you can imagine the big explosion noise that gargantuan rock lets out
when you use items they make noises too nothing special though just a nice little ring to let you know that you have used it i guess
when you fill up your limit break bar it makes a noise to let you know youre ready to use it but if the sound doesnt let you know im sure the bright flash of fire around your character should get your attention
every little noise you should notice and remember the rest of your measly life
if you dont then i guess youre not as big of a loser you thought you were now huh
so to nobuo i thank you for giving us this wonderful piece of art you call the ffvii soundtrack
i am sure that everyone would agree with mestory game play graphics sound overall rating 
if you havent figured it out by now you need to go out and play this game
do what you have to and make sure you go through the whole thing and enjoy yourself
a lot of people will tell you this game is over rated
even if it is so what its a good game and that is all that matters
while mentioning this great ff title i suggest that you try some of the older titles that are great too such as ffiii or ff the original
this is one of the best series of games out there and if you havent heard of it yet then you need to have a better source of information for games
so go out and play this you will love it
i bet when you find a penny on the ground you will be thankful it helped you buy this gameman if you want to experience the greatest video game ever then this is it look no farther
this game has it all
the most well thought out story ever on a video game
great character development
many many side quest
dymatic ending and great finishif you can find any game that can match that criteria and do it as well as ff then ill eat your hat
screw  stars starswith impressive graphics unforgettable characters and a simply amazing storyline final fantasy vii is definately a game that shouldnt be underestimated
there are many ways to go about playing the game you can go straight through the story or you can take your time and explore
and thats one of the things i like about rpgs
its a must have for any gamer in my opinionback when this game came out i received a video tape of the game in the mail i watched it several times that was the day i decided that the  playstation was a good system i ended up buying the game first then  getting the system for my birthday  weeks later
this game is the best  playstation game ever made not to mention the best rpg
i have played  through it twice the first time by myself and the second time with the  official guide book it was amazing both time through i spen  hours the  first time and  hours the second
the second time took longer because i  got my characters levels up really high like even though the final fantasy series was already incredibly popular in japan before this game was released in the united states rpgs were not quite as well known as other kinds of games
final fantasy  the first final fantasy on the playstation and to use d graphics changed everything about the console rpg genre
even though people will have differing opinions about the enjoyability of this game no serious gamer would deny the tremendous influence final fantasy  has had on videogamingby todays standards the graphics in this game are quite primitive but at the time they were absolutely amazing
the d backgrounds are still great to look at today as well
the music in this game is also great despite the rather limited selection of sounds nobou uematsu had at his disposal
of particular note is the song that plays during the final boss encounter one winged angel which is still beloved by final fantasy fans todaydespite the move from d to d the gameplay in final fantasy  is  similar to the previous six final fantasy games
as you control your character on an overworld map you encounter random mobs which you fight in an active time battle system
the magic system based on materia is new and just complicated enough to provide some strategic depth without overwhelming new players
playing through the main story is not particularly challenging some bosses may require a few tries but there are extensive side quests available at the end of the game some of which are very involved and difficult without a solid strategyhowever the main attraction of this game is the story
anyone who has played through the game will remember cloud his friends and the enigmatic sephiroth who are still iconic figures in the game world
that squareenix still releases games and movies based on the ff world helps no doubt
the plot is quite strange and frequently confusing but in its essentials it worked for me
the translation could have used some more polish but is of good enough quality as to not distract from the rest of the gameif there are people studying the history of video games fifty years from now there is little doubt that final fantasy  would be one of the games they would look at since it is probably the most influential console rpg ever
if you havent played this game yet and have any interest in rpgs at all you should try to find a copy of this game and play it
if only squareenix would remake this game for the psthe artwork is badthereive said itthis was the first ff to ever become d and for that it should be revolutionary alone but the best part is the storyline
the characters grow on you and there is a twist at the end if i told you it wouldnt be a surprise and all characters are individual even though some characters are barely used does anyone put cait sith in their party
the gameplay uses the atb system and learning comes from the materia system which allows you to customise what characters can learn
and not to mention the puzzles from sneaking into the dons mansion to finding a way to defeat the emerald weaponthis game will keep you entertained for years
buy itthis game is a beautiful work of art that takes you on a trip through happiness sadness anger and just about every other emotion conceivable by man
this game will attach itself to your brain and never let you forget about it
this game never ceases to evoke a reaction from the player and never ceases to amaze everyone who plays itstoryline  one of the most intricate that i have ever played
the storyline rivals that of albert odyssey which i regarded as being the greatest rpg before i played this
what initially begins as a fight to destroy an evil corporation becomes an entire journey towards revenge and the defending of things greater than the world
music  the music is beautiful always fitting and stays in your head for days
aeris theme alone is enough to motivate you to buy the soundtrack
absolutely wonderful
almost the best aspect of the game
characters  the best
cloud looks so cool with his gigantic sword and the ability to rename them just adds on to the fun
as one man already said this is probably the first game that ive played in which a main character dies without a huge rescue or love scene right before it
even though theyre just game characters they feel real
overall  final fantasy vii is the best rpg if not the best game ever created by man
you must buy this game
periodive played final fantasy   and  and i have to say  is the best
every part of this game is perfect
sure the characters arent highly detailed but for the time when this game was made theyre perfect
you find yourself falling in love with these super deformed people
especially cloud who is the best main character in all of the final fantasy games
the story line is very involving
people wouldnt play this game for  hours if the story wasnt good
its almost disappointing that they didnt base the final fantasy movie on this game butif they did that youd already know the ending
this game is a masterpiece
i wouldnt change one thing about this game
i love iti was one of the people who were diehard final fantasy fanatics way before the mainstream hype
furthermore i was a fan of ff way before it got all hypedup
while ff is still my favorite the sheer magnitude of revolutionary changes that this game brought about not only for the franchise but for the industry altogether make this game welldeserving of its current fanbase and subsequent prequel and sequel
the story is immersive and fulfilling for those interested in getting into the intricacies of it
the gameplay is original
the rpg aspects are unique
the graphics are tolerable unless you are a picky newage gamer
one must keep in mind that for its time the graphics and cgi cutscenes were extraordinary
this game was the first to introduce the ultimate weapons and superbosses to the franchise
although it is the first to keep them attainable and within reason
no obnoxious grinding or farming necessary to attain victory
just the classic strategies and game play that make final fantasy greatanyone hesitant because of its current status or its vintage status or any other reason should give it a chance
i can assure any respectable gamer that they will be pleasantly surprised by this outstanding title
greatest game ever to some outstanding adventure to mei love ffvii its my favorite rpg
i bought this because my old copy was damaged
the replacement worked well and was much cheaper than any i found in game storesi love this game
it is absolutely the best vg i have ever playedfollow the life of cloud strife an exsoldier who joins avalanche a club who is full of crime fighting agents such as tifa barret and yuffie
one time on a dangerous mission he meets aeris a flower girl from the slumsthey then set out on an adventure to defeat shinraunquestionbly the best rpg ever and a strong candidate for the best game ever squares playstationdebut final fantasy  still stands the test of time today as one of their strongest titles in recent memory and a sort of howto guide to getting computer games rightreleased in  on a tidal wave of publicity rumours remember the memory card debate
and expectations final fantasy  took peoples preconceptions of the genre and utterly redefined them
gone were the traditional topdown viewpoints the dimensional characters and the boring spell effects and we watched in amazement at hithertounparalleled graphics and a completely revolutionary storyline showed us exactly how good a rpg could be
winning legions of new fans over to the genre ff  fully deserved its blockbusting bestselling statusff  follows the story of cloud strife a young mercenaryforhire and his attempts to stop his excolleague and nemesis sephiroth from destroying the world
along the way he meets some memorable characters makes friends and discovers who he truly isthe strongest selling point of ff  at the time of its release was the graphics which today understandably have been surpassed several times over
however some moments in the game still hold their own against the modern consoles and for a seven yearold game thats no small feat
what remains today is one of the best storylines ever coupled with some of the smoothest game mechanics in videogaming historythe emotion behind the characters of aeris cloud sephiroth etc is something which games developers have only recently started to latch on to  for example silent hill  and fatal frame go deep into the psychology of emotion  but in a character and storydriven game like ff  the depth of attachment we form with the characters is simply amazing
its impossible to treat ff  as a piece of retrogaming such is the depth of development behind the storyline
it tackles subjects like political upheaval religion selfworth  and does it all in such a way as to force us to mentally attach ourselves to the little people running about on the screenthe gameplay too is superb with an easy menu system and full ingame tutorials being accessible at pretty much any point in the game
the difficulty level is pitched exactly right theres a steady learning curve and monsters and battles become significantly harder as you progress but not so hard as to be prohibitive
puzzles and secrets abound and each time you play and you will play it multiple times you discover several new features that you didnt see before
with typical square finnesse the game options are customisable so battles and cutscenes dont have to take up too much time and the whole game moves at a speed which you the player dictatei cant rave enough
possibly equalled in terms of absorbing entertainment only by its own sequels ff  is still a rewarding hugely entertaining and very special game
totally recommendedthats my story and im sticking to it
if you were to only have  final fantasies get those   and  aka  also  was pretty funi could tell right at the beginning when the game started that i was going to have fun playing it
it grabs you immediately along with the looks that i had never seen before
it is easy to give this game a perfect  because when i played final fantasy vii it was more fun best looking and a huge free roaming world i had ever experience
i loved all the vehicles that were in the game along with the music
if you have never played this game i believe you would have fun just because of the story line along with the superior game play which is the most important aspect rightthe game is not hard to figure out in terms of fighting and leveling up so getting right to the game play is what you do
it is near and dear to my hearti had purchased a playstation months before this title came out specifically anticipating a great upgrade of the super nintendo titles squaresoft had been producing up til this point
this game far exceeded my hopes and wishes impressing me with the d characters the story the materia system even the music
its what rewarded me for waiting and choosing sony for my new gaming platform
ive been a great fan of their games that followed especially their landmark success final fantasy x for the psthe game has an interesting plot compelling characters and many challenges and secrets to discover
it also has a few plot twists that add spice
if you havent played this game or those that have followed please start here
it just gets better from this point onthis is the huge game were taling about its so huge that your twisted mind will only focus at game and figure your huge mind its the best rpg better then ffxgraphics it may be a little bad but hey its oldgameplayunlimitedover your big headdisks  it has  compacked adventure cdroms and this is the first  disk continued gamethis is always your thumps up games and if u hate it then u are not an rpg player i repeat u are not a rpg playerfinal fantasy  is in my opinion the best game in the entire series
the graphics are crisp the gameplay is as fun as any other ff game and the music is epic
this is nearly a perfect gamei borrowed this game from a friend and it wasawsome
it has all the stuff i likedi dont get how people are dissing this game for its graphicshello you idiots it was made in 
it was made along time ago but for that time the graphics aretop notch
the game is  disk andenjoyable for allget the gamenow let me begin by saying im not an rpg gamer i borrowed this from a friend because i was hearing so much about how great this game is i recently borrowed it during the summer and i must say ilovethisgame
i mean at first i wasnt into the ploti started getting sucked into it as soon as i got to disc and the game aswell but after a few hours of playing i was hooked now as i stated before i am not an rpg gamer but this game had one of those really cool animetype plots and the turned base battles were pretty cool
the gameplay was pretty fun and i was always excited to see were the game would take me next the dialoug if you ask me was a little dumb i mean just because barret is african american every most of the things he says has to always be spelled differently and have  letter words
ok im done gripping
other then plot and gameplay i really liked how the materiamagic worked aswell as the summonsman they are such a treat to look at
and i think im going abit too far but i thought the cg scenesthough very limited in the gamewere beautiful
as for visuals i dont see why people are saying this games visuals are terrible this game was made back in the mid s
i thought the visuals were great
and the pre rendered backrounds were great aswell
stop complaining its an old gamenow audioi kid you not after beating this game i downloaded almost every song from the gamecosmo canyon is by far one of my favorite songs ever played on a video game
the music is just beautiful the song played in cosmo canyon is let alone a reason to get the game sountrack as well as the final battle with sepheroth
the best part about the audio is they fit perfectly well for every scenarioareabattle
i do plan on buying this games soundtrack when i have the timenow being my first rpg i dont know what to expect but ill say it anwaysmy first time through this game was pretty long i never went through every side quest but i did do a few cause i was a little paranoid that id mess up from random battles to leveling up boss battles to getting to every placelandcave that i went through to progress through this great game and my length went down to a total of  hours so yes you bet your sweet keester that your first time through this game will take awhile as it is spanning  discs
ok im getting tired lets just get this over withthe goodi love the music in this gamethe cg in this game is just wonderfulwhy are people complaining about visuals they get a  on my book well for its time atleastthe turn based battles were pretty funomnislashnuff saidthe summons were a treat to seeviva la bahumut zero
i loved all the characters so much in this game its like you cared for them and really wanted them to just survive through the game especially red xiimy favorite character in the game disc more then  hours of gameplay and tons of stuff to do to extend the time period of the games lengththe badi wouldseriously no joke just jump out of my seat when a random battle happend i think its cause i had my volume very highthe random battles do get annoyingi thought leveling up did get pretty annoying and boring at partsi was worried that i had to be in a certain level so i can be strong enough for a boss so id spend like  of the game leveling upother then that i really liked this game i loved the music visuals story especially the characters and the whole worldatmosphere was beautiful and there isnt anything that really botherd me except for a few boss battlesother then that this is a must own for the playstation
in the end i give this fantastic game a out of  starsthis was by far my favorite rpg game
all the other final fantasies and others are good but this one just blew me away
the graphics may not be the best but the touching and unforgettable storyline makes up for that
the characters are soo cool and if someone tried to improve this game it would bevery hard because its already perfect
id definetly recomend this game ive played tons of video games and this is still my fav
even though its olderfinal fantasy  is a masterpiece
what a cliche
masterpiece a term suggesting the undisputed magnum opus of an already venerable company
many things gain this mark but few live up to their expectation
final fantasy  doesin many ways final fantasy  is far from perfect
the graphics compared to today are dated grainy and harsh
the storyline reeks of clicheridden overtones
the characters seem generic
however this is all a product of subsequent gamesfinal fantasy  defined the d graphical engine used in almost all of todays rpgs
its characters still fresh were very unique emotionally unstable and enjoyable to read about
the storyline spins off numerous tangents and undertones that suggested a fully functioning realistic world that presents reallife human troublesthis is far from a typical rpg
from its conception it redefined the genre and introduced the rpg to about  million new gamers
saying that final fantasy  singlehandedly elevated rpgs from niche to mainstream status would be far from an erraneous statementconsidering all of these things a person skeptical about playing final fantasy  should grant reconsideration
though it is far from the prettiest and most unique of games it does represent the model that all of todays successful rpgs follow
and in this case the model is more radiant than its spinoffsthanks for this classic final fantasy game
this will be the first  disk long rpg ive played though but who cares
its greatwellllllthis is your ticket
final fantasy vii is the ultimate in what is the most successful and also greatest series of roleplaying games of all time
there are all sorts of pros to the game but only a few consand the cons barely matterprosan incredible storydeep and engaging playbeautiful battle graphics and cg cinemasplenty of subquestsverrrry lengthyunique charactershollywoodworthy musicplenty of plottwistscons there are fewsometimes a bit tediousbattle system is a bit flawedterrible land animationif you devote your life to gaming you may have to say goodbye to your family and friendsthe bottom line this is an altogether gaming masterpiece spanning three discs of epic conflict timeless romance and magical battles
if your forte in gaming is roleplaying in general or the final fantasy series then i highly recommend this gamepswow
i cant believe how much the price of this game has skyrocketed
im lucky i bought this game when it cost a whopping 
people if you have this game by all means hang on to itwhen my friend told me about this game i was like whateva
when he went home he left it at my house
i decided to se what it was all bout
when i played it i started to enjoy it and i played it for  hours till i got dizzy
there where a few problems but i didnt give bout it cuz i enjoyed the obsorbing storyline and gameplay
pros and cons of the gane whereprosa storyline that is maxed out to  hours characters that are wit ugreat fmv sequencemakes u wanna git everything at the end before u fight sephrothalot of bad language for a game thats rated t i like thata beutiful d backround and world mapmakes u wanna play for hoursconstoo many random battlesgraphics on characters are outdatedlooks like little kids runnintakes too long to git limit breakno talking at alltakes too long to level up materiathis game is one of the greatest rpgs or games ever
and now that it is only  you must buy it
and whatever you do spend your money on this game not  blech
the characters are great with the magic system dealing with materia which have different spells and effects so in other words your characters are all costomizible
the plot is great always surprising and pretty scary
this game is worth every single cent when you buy it and its only twenty buckssure the word quotepicquot is thrown around a lot on the back covers of games but this game really is one
of course you can probably tell that from the fact that its three discs long
from the great music to the excellent battle system to the plot with a depth rarely seen in video games to the wonderful graphics okay so the graphics arent wonderful
in fact they suck
the exception to the graphics comes in the fairly cool looking occasional movie scenes
not being a huge rpg fan i took the fairly direct route through the game
rpg extremists have a ton more to do from raising chocobos to fighting that expletive deleted ruby weapon
also the special attacks are really cool
they range from fancy swordfighting techniques like crossslash to a guy who turns into popular horror movie characters a jason imitation complete with chainsaw helped me defeat safer sephiroth 
anyway this is a great game that is worth more than twenty bucks so get iti was in th grade when this came out
i saved up and bought it
ive played through it many times
this game not only brought the console rpgs into the spot light but it also brought a lot of fun to millions of fansignore all of these peole saying its nothing special because they compare it to everything that came after it
in  this game was ton of fun but if you are going to buy it now and expect bells and whistles like all the more current rpgs then you will be disapointed
i have nothing bad to say about ff its a great game and will always be one of my all time favoritesilove this gameits its just breathtaking
it has a great story but the graphics could have had a bit of work
if you love a  good rpg get this game
i said get this gamethis final fantasy  is one of the most influenced games of all time
the fan bases for this one game blows out all ff fan base out of the water
never has any other ff game seen such an influenced with multiple related gamesstory characters found in different games
multiple movies
toys cards etc based on this game
why was that all necessary for this one gameits just that damn awesome
this game has everything
story characters battle system music humor and more
if it didnt why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after
because it was just damn awesomeyou can play this game over and over before getting tried of it but you will keep it in your hearts forever
the amazing game play the amazing characters and amazing graphics
back in those days
they just cant make anything that even comes close to what they did back then
i wish they did but they cant
it was just too well done
loli think that this is truly one of the best rpgs of all time for the ps
it is very fun and addicting i have played it for around  hours and it is still good
it takes a while to beat and get everything so you should play this game for a good amount of time so it is worth buying
also the summonings in this game are cool
the only down side is that the cgs they are alright for when it came out but now
other than that this is proably one of the best games i have ever played for the psthe first final fantasy on a system is always the best as it seems to bring out the best in squares developers
final fantasy vii is no different with the perfect amount of playstation flair to compliment not overtake the strong story and game system that are the series hallmarkswhile oldschool gamers may prefer predefined roles for each character the materia system is still meritorious on its own allowing uncomplicated customization of characters and adding great depth to gameplay
character development proceeds well with nearly every battle in the game having purpose unlike some rpgs where hours are spent leveling up to get characters past an obstacle and the ingame pointers help clarify locations whenever the lush graphics are unclear
the soundtrack is otherworldly with several haunting beautiful songs that are simply unforgettablebut final fantasys core has always been its great storylines and this installment has one of the best
characters develop and mature realistically and you get to know each one intimately almost feeling kinship with some of them
the plot is suitably but not comically epic and the main struggle plays out better than most hollywood movies
nearly everyone will laugh and cry at various parts of the game a feat precious few video games have ever accomplished
from a storytellers perspective the shocking twist at the games midpoint is perhaps too easy a way to draw emotion from the player but there is no denying its effectiveness as it is one of the most memorable scenes in video game historysquare has released many rpgs on playstation some of them terrific on their own but none have topped their first a mustpurchase for all playstation owners
if you like incredible stories but dont own a playstation its worth buying one just for final fantasy viiby far the best final fantasy ever madeit was the first ff to be made on psx and the gameplay graphics were ok but the cg graphics were really really goodi was speechless at the end of the game where everything comes together and the big twist is revealed
that was awesomeso basically i give it  stars cuz i looove itthis is a fantastic game
its got a great storyline full of twists and turns
it has a lot of optional dungeons and bosses an optional characters too
its your average  hours but obtaining the gold chocobo and gttings couds final limit break can be chalenging and take hours themselves
i recommend this gamebought the game cause i love the series and shockingly this game is the same age as i am feel great to hold a piece of gaming history in my hands storys great every aspect of the game is greatthis is the best game ever
its more than a game its more a way of life
it draws you in and you feel part of the whole gaming experience something that final fantasy viii fails to do
the storyline is immense the characters are varied there is a piloe a dog type lion beast a cat on a mog and an ancient unlike the sequel where everyone is a human
materia collecting is fun the fights are testing the towns and destinations are varied the world map is huge until you get the highwind and the sub games are superbthe only fault with the graphics are the on screen characters which are too cartoony
apart from that though the graphics are brilliant the music is one of the best soundtracks ever and the gameplay and lifespan are both excellent
defenitly worth the money
buy it nowclassic storyline good music sweet battle system
one of if not the best game ever madetheres nothing much to say about this game its the best game ive ever played and well if you have a ps or ps and you do not have this game you are stupid
go and buy it nowthis game is very fun
though this game does have graphics that arent nearly as good as say final fantasy x or final fantasy xii it is still an extremely fun and addicting game
i would suggest this game to any one who likes video games and owns a playstationgraphics  of movies  of the graphics for the opening sequence was amazing  a huge jump from the graphics in ff   right from the start you could tell that the graphics for this game was going to be of a level that we had never seen before on snesworld map  of the d rotatable graphics on the world map was also amazing  there were times i would just walk around just to look at the graphics  it really felt like i was therebattle  of  it was really nice to see a character with realistic proportions fight instead of the deformed chibis we saw in ff  and before
 it was really cool how the characters flashed before doing a limit break
reminds me of street fighter characters right before they do a super combo
 it was interesting how each character had a different winning pose
 a movie for the summons was nice although it got timeconsuming after a whileeverywhere else  of outside of the movies and world map field the characters were so tiny they were hard to see
i cant count the number of times i got lost
and when there was a closeup of the characters they were very blocky and of low quality
even if the graphics are beautiful if i cant see where my characters and the exits are then its more of a hindrance than a sight to beholdmusic  of some of the songs for this soundtracks are the best video game music ive ever heard  in fact my most listened to song on my ipod is the world map theme song which ive listened to over  times
i also like the battle music the music on the bridge slower version of theme song anxiety the opening movie theme song and yuffies hometown songthe only reason i give the music  of  is because some of the music was annoying such as the slum music
was i happy to get out of therestory  characters  of pros cloud aeris tifa barrett and yuffie are easily among my most favorite video game characters of alltime
 the date scene for all of the characters was interesting and even very humorous depending on what choices you made
 aeris was developed so well that she was the reason i cried while playing a video game
 i also like some of the sub characters like elena the man and woman with a distinctive laugh and the boss who didnt like the mans laugh
the only other sub characters ive ever liked are tanya from dq  and gilgamesh from ff   to have  interesting sub characters come from a single game is simply amazing character developmentcons clouds memory loss was implausible and confusing
 whatever happened to sepiroth in the end to become whatever he became was so confusing i still dont understand what happened to him to this day
 i dont understand why a mechanic is an expert with the spear
 vincent was developed poorly  he was not memorable to me at all
 stats wise the characters arent different enough
it doesnt really matter who you give materia to they can still be just as effective as the next character if certain stats boosts like hp up are addeddespite the flaws any video game that can make me cry deserves a  of  for story  character developmentbattle system  of this is hands down the best battle system ive ever seenpros pace that abilities and spells are learned is perfect with the ability system and slots
 the types of combos that could be made with the materia was simply amazing
 the idea of using slots helped to minimize any single character from becoming overpowered
 limit breaks was a very innovative ideacons having more than  of each materia could lead to insane overpowering such as having  counters
 most of the limit breaks are the same  they just do damage
i wish there was more variety
 summons could use more variety   bahamuts were excessive
i missed the golem and carbunkle
 getting the materia that had a lot of abilities in it led to overpowering characters
 only  characters in at a time without being able to switch out hurtalthough this system had some flaws its clearly the best ive ever seen before and since
i really wish the later ff games improved on this to make it perfectmini games  of pros i really loved the snowboarding  condor fortcons i died multiple times trying to beat the submarine mini game
 some of the mini games were annoying to beat like doing the correct soldier moves
can i just defeat a tough monster instead of playing these silly gamesconclusion  of ff  is by no means a perfect game and has its share of flaws
however the good points of this game outshine the flaws to such a point that i have no choice to give it a  of   i never thought in my wildest dreams that a video game could make me cry
clearly one of the best games ive ever played in my lifeprosa very deep engrossing and heartfelt storymemorable charactersvery customizable gameenriching soundtrackvery detailed cinematics and incredible looking prerendered backgrounstons and tons of optional things to doconsthe characters may be memorable but the game does little to develop them beyond a certain pointtheres no big incentive to use one character over anotherit may very well be one of the easiest final fantasy games in the seriesafter eleven years final fantasy vii still manages to be a beast in the rpg field
boasting a colossal story and a few memorable characters
final fantasy vii is the game which made the jrpg genre big in the west and eleven years later it still ranks as one of the greatest games of all timefinal fantasy vii centers on cloud strife
a mercenary who has joined the rebelious group known as avalanche who are taking on the shinra corporation that is slowly draining the planet of its life
the story all comes together by clouds mysterious past a terrifying villain and some heartfelt characters
the story of final fantasy vii spans so much more than just an evil corporation
youll eventually find yourself on a journey that involves you saving the world
even compared to today final fantasy vii is an rpg that breaks the rules of traditional storytelling
rather than being a band of teenagers out to stop some evil adults as the jrpg has been drowned out in in recent years final fantasy vii puts you in the role of characters about something more
if there were any criticism of the story it would be that its a lot to take in
some things never really come together in the end and youll be left with a lot of burning questions
much of this you can bet is due to some of final fantasy viis shoddy translation
there were some pieces in the localization process that were left out entirely and make the story come off as a little more sloppy than it was intended to
another small criticism comes with its characters
while theyre memorable they often times take a backseat to some of the stories progression
once we learn what we need to learn about certain characters the game never really touches them or makes them integral to the plot itself again
if it werent for their stark personalities funny quips and own charms you might forget themever since final fantasy iv the series has used the atb battle system and final fantasy vii is no exception
every character has an atb gauge that lets them take action once its filled
pretty basic but final fantasy vii gets a bump by being very customizable
the materia system allows for nearly endless possibilities for its characters
there are several different kinds of materia
theres your basic magic materia that give you spells to cast but there is also materia to give you more battle commands such as being able to steal or throw items at an enemy
there are other materia there just to boost your stats and others that enhance your spells by giving you the ability to hit all the enemies at once or to absorb health from your enemies
there are far more in each category and they give you infinite ways to play final fantasy viiwithout materia though your characters are naked and can only attack
this brings about small problem
the first being that theres is no incentive to use any one character above another
final fantasy vii remedies this by givng its character ultra powerful limit breaks
every character has a limit gauge and when it fills up as they take damage
when full they can let forth a brutal attack
characters also have limit levels for different limit breaks and the higher the limit level the more damage you have to take before its full
unfortunately this is all that makes any character different in battle
materia gives them legs but you can always transfer over anyone elses materia to anyone else
in the long run this wont bother anyone but it leads to a lack of variety in the characters and you more than likely wont need limit breaks that much to begin with
final fantasy viis pros more than outnumber the cons
the amount of customization is great but it still wouldve been nice to need one characters ability over anotherfinal fantasy vii is by no means a hard game
it is arguably one of the easiest games in the series
in particular the final battle turns out to be one of the easiest fights in the game against someone who has often been labeled one of the most threatening in history
yet final fantasy vii makes for that with several hidden goodies
you wont find too many optional dungeons in final fantasy vii but you will find an incredible number of optional things to do off the beaten path
from breeding and racing chocobos to finding hidden materia to taking on ultra powerful bosses and even finding hidden characters who have more than just a face but actually play into the story itself
there are more secrets in final fantasy vii than even most rpgs of todaygraphically final fantasy vii is a mixed bag
in  these graphics were phenominal
the prerendered backgrounds are still incredible looking even to this day
the seventh final fantasy has a lot of style
the polygons are charming though they dont look as cool as the rest of the environments
the fmvs are still amazing and wonderfully detailed for its time
there are a couple of moments of slowdown with final fantasy vii however and some of the summon animations can get lengthy and repetitive
but they dont take away from its wildly detaile environmentsthe music score may actually be the most rewarding thing for final fantasy vii
the music score manages to fill the situations for the right moment
but it also isnt afraid to showcase a lot of emotion either
there are some moments where it can be dark and others where its very light
in particular the character themes are really nice and memorable
final fantasy vii doesnt have the best soundtrack within the series but it has some of the most memorable music numbers of the entire seriesafter eleven years final fantasy vii is still a force to be reckoned with
there are a few gaps in its storyline that you may have to read a bit more deeply to learn about as not all of it is within the game itself but if anything confuses you there have been countless faqs written as well as spinoffs and sequels and it shuns some of its characters at points but the package is still one of the best playstation outings of all time and every gamer should pick up and play final fantasy vii at least oncethis game really quotisquot the best game in existance
it is just wonderful great besti could go on like this telling how good it is however i can only put  words in my review
this game almost makes it to being perfectalmost
here are my ratings and my discription of this gamegraphics
  starsgraphics are alright
when it comes to how they look for d i would say quotgoodquot but for realism during game playi dunno
theycharacters and people and things looknot so good
however the graphics during battles are very good also during cut scenesmoviesmusic  starsreally very good musici espicially like the battle music and the ancient citycity of the ancients music
oh and the chocobo battle musicstory line  stars very good story line alot of different things other than shinra and sepherothcharacters stars i like most of the characters except for yuffie
here is a hint dont look for her if you get this gameoverall  stars only problems are random battles can get anoying you cant skip cutscenesi guess thats not too bad but the movie at the begining i wish you could skip atleasttakes too long after birth or breeding for a chocobo to be able to breed againyou playwell you actually play several characterscloud strife an exmember of soldierkind of an army police sort of thing working for shinra who has joined with a team avalanche who are against shinraa corporation that is draining mako energy out of the planet with reactors without mako energy the planet will die
but what starts out as a mission against shinra becomes a struggle to save the world
its more than that though so i will leave you to find out for yourself
there are alot of side quests too
like chocobo breedingoh yeahyou gotta try that or the gold saucer which is like a big arcadedisregard all negative reviews about this gamethey dont know what there talking about
go out and get this gameand if you dont have a psplaystation get one just for this gameso go out and get final fantasy  nowthat is a quote from the back of the jewel but i wasnt quite sure to believe it
i saw it in stores  years ago had heard all of the hype and figured id spend the  bucks to get it
it was one of the best  i have ever spent
now wait a sec dont think this review is just biased raving claiming this to be the best game ever of all time and for the rest of time
while at this point i would like to say that i realize that saying it wouldnt help much so ill focus on the actual gameokay so it is from  and it is currently  that makes this game  years old
the graphics have to be pretty bad right
wrong
while the realtime graphics dont compare to current games the cutscenes are fantastic
really they are beautiful
lots of games have the power to make great graphics and they do but these are put together like a movie in that the camera angles are great the render engine is stunning and not to mention the scene layouts are incredible
some of the really great cut scenes dont come until later in the game but you wont be bored during the wait
that brings me to the next subject
the gameplay is very well executed
it is a turnbased rpg which means battles are seperate from when you walk around and such
your moves are executed in the atb active time battle system where you dont wait your turn but rather a time meter fills up that determines when you attack defend cast a spell etc there are several characters you can cycle between who is in your party at most times and they each have their own strengths and weaknesses
skill is aquired by gaining experience points and leveling up
you can also get better armor shields weapons etc
apart from the battle system there is the final fantasy unique world map
it means that instead of having levelsstagesboards you can explore gain experience and level up etc
by going wherever you want on literally an entire planet
although the storyline restricts this at certain timesokay so now that we have the graphics stuff out of the way lets move on to the story
in my opinion the story is the best part of the game
if no other part of this game remains the best for all time then the story will
i truly believe that this is the best storyline ever in a game
although it is slightly cliched i will say that it is a touching but exciting story about love and hate good and evil the horrible effects of an evil corporations technological expansion killing the planet and very original story points that unfortunately trying to explain could very well ruin the game for you
youre just gonna have to spend the  to find out
i would pay  if i knew how great it was gonna befinally the music score
for a video game this is unbelievable
ffvii pulled the game industry out of the horrible pit of midi blip sounds and other bad music with a huge bound
the soundtrack is huge every single song from the opening menu to the ending credits  hours later is absolutely incredible and i would venture to say epic
each one is wonderfully written ranging from lighthearted and happy to melancholy and sad to powerful cut scene tracks if you like them enough they have an  track soundtrack availablei could go on forever about how great all of these things are but i imagine that the review readers wouldnt appreciate that so i will cut the rest shortthis game was stunning in  and it is stunning in  it is like no other game i have ever played and is definately for a more mature crowd as some kids wouldnt understand the plot and some of the themeslanguage might not be very appropriate for kids
i am not kid bashing here
some can understand it but it is all maturity level that counts not age
just use discretionas for weak points good luck finding any because i sure havent
well i hope my review has helped you make a better choice
but for 
come on give it a try
you will at least be somewhat entertained for the  or  hours it takes to play all  discs
happy gamingfinal fantasy is the most popular game in japanese rpg game
the popularity is devide to dragon questowarrior in half
final fantasy is the work more than  years ago
the hard system was nintendo family computer these days
and in final fantasy  the hard changed to super family computer
in this final  the hard changed to play station
as my title the hard spec extended very much by changed from supaer famicon to play station
concletely the soft system changed from casette to cdrom
for that the garafic and sound etc got to be very real
the difference of final was remarkable more than other title of final seriesthe most remakable difference was the changing from d to d
i memorized the first moving when i played finalthank you for reading poor englishffvii is the best
in this ff you get to equip stones called materia and use abilities based on what the materia is
and the best part is after a while when you bring a materia to its higest level it will form another materia of the same type
the amount of materia you can equip is based on what weapon you have equipped
and you can improve materia with other materia on some occassions
there are five different types of materiaamagic materia lets your character cast spellsbcommand materia lets you character use commands such as steal or enemy skill also known as blue magiccindependent materia gives your character improved stats or passive abilitiesdsummon materia lets you summon characters such as ifrit or shivaesupport materia allows you to add abilities to linked materiathere is however one slight problem about a certain materia
in this game there is a support materia called elemental
what this materia does is it adds a connected materias elements to your attack if equipped on a weapon or protects you from connected elements if equipped on armor
the problem comes in play if you equip this to your weapon
if you run into an enemy who is strong against the elements that isare attached to elemental you have no way to change the elemental properties that the weapon currently possesses
so you may have to start back to your last save point if the situation gets really bad and all you can do is attackthis is the first ff to have limits
basically this lets use a unique and usually strong move when you character takes enough damage so its kind of like being in a rage
and as you use limits more and more you can get more and more different attacks you can use when you reach your limit break when you can use a limitif you dont already have ffvii hurry and get it
you wont be disappointedi wanted this game so badly for years so i finally just went for it
i heard it was one of the best games ever made and it is true
i actually beat it today and am so happy
it was made in  and still competes with games made today
it has a great story and some of the best characters ever
i got so attached to these characters
i wont get into too much detail because other reviewers already did a good job explaining that but it truly is a great game
the graphics are fine for an old game and i find the character design very charming
the game is really fun too
i just couldnt stop playing i always was so excited to play more and see what would happen next
i even knew a good amount of what would happen ahead of time because of what i had read and seen and it was still exciting
there is also a lot to do
after about  hours i still havent done everythingi have a few things i want to add
if youre wondering if it works well on a ps
yes perfectly
and one more thing
i bought the game used not greatest hits and it had trouble because of the condition it was in so i bought a new copy that is the greatest hits version
the older one comes with a case that is very annoying because it is really hard to get disc  out
i was worried about having to bend the disc to get it out
i would highly suggest buying the greatest hits version because the case is made better
all of the discs come out easily so no disc bendingso in short if you want to see what all the fuss is about buy it and see
i loved itfinal fantasy vii is easily my favorite final fantasy game and i know them all
i own ffivvviviiviiiix and x and have beaten ffviiviiiixand x and this one is the best
i have to recommend it to everyone rpg fan or not
squaresoft was at its prime in this period what with ffvii  xenogears my favorite squaresoft games
the battle format is the tried and true active form you have a active time battle gauge that fills and when it fills the character can attack
enemies dont have to wait for you to use your turn to use theirs
there are tons of commands ex
attack deathblow magic item morph steal mime etc
but many require materia to use
materia is what you insert into your weapon and armors empty materia slots to gain the materias ability while it is equipped
you gain ap as well as exp and gil  after winning a fight
ap levels up your equipped materia
it is important not to overload your character with materia though because as cloud says in a tutorial it acts as a doublesided sword
while it gives you abilities it also can subtract from your stats
the story starts small as a rebel group avalanche fighting the shinra corporation that is turning the only huge city on gaia midgar into one big industrial market
they are putting up mako reactors that suck the energy from the earth and convert it to power
avalanche destroys a couple of these in missions and shinra devises a plan
 year old cloud is just joining avalanche but reluctantly he is very cruel hearted and troubled do to his past in the beginning but that changes
quickly the scheme becomes much more grandiose as sephiroth gets involved
avalanche falls apart and the core members and a few other characters leave to follow sephiroth while shinra searches for the promised land a land with tons of mako energy
the story is serious
a main character even dies at the climax of the first disc
it leads you through tons of places and aquaints you with many people
of course the ever popular biggs and wedge return as does cid you may not get this if you arent big for final fantasy games
the limit breaks are cool
during battle there is a gauge called limit break which fills when you are attacked
when it fills all the way you can use limit breaks which are very strong attacks
you learn new ones by using previous ones or a variety of other ways for certain characters
the status effects such as poison or mute are used
the ammount of materia is staggering
the summons are great but one stands out as fairly impossible to not be a one hit kill besides on safer sephiroth if he has on wall or emerald and ruby weapon regardless
this summon is common knowledge for final fantasy enthusiasts knights of the round where  knights attack the enemies
if you have a good magic stat they do a good  damage per attack  x    damage
the graphics are standout awesome for their time but nowadays they arent special and the character designs are a disaster but again they were awesome back in the days
the sound is top notch with awesome music
just like xenogears its one of those few games where i like the music
there are a few huge disappointments the chocobo battle music and a few instant favorites the safer sephiroth music one winged angel
the game length is about  hours but youll keep playing it to get to level  and complete every last side quest like me
and clock in  hours if you have one ounce of common sense
the control is flawless except for the x for cancel and circle for confirm but that can be fixed with the customizable controls very easily
i just cant believe that youre still reading this review
buy the game already you wont regret itif youre a fan then theres no need to read this any further
i wont say much but this is truly one of the greatest rpgs ever madeffvii is a role playing game where your decisions during the game will effect the overall outcome of the game
you are in control of a character named cloud an ex member of the famed soldier from shinra inc cloud along with a group of freedom fighters by the name of avalanche try to free the city of midgar from the evil clutches of the president of shinra inc along the way cloud befriends a young flower girl a scientific experiment specimen a fortune teller an assasin a ninja and an ex pilot who help him in freeing midgar
but there is an even deeper evil at work here as cloud and his friends discover that the greatest soldier in the world sephiroth plans to destroy the entire world
now with the help of his newfound comrades cloud must face his teenage past and face his teenage idol in a climatic battle for the freedom of the world and the destruction of evilfinal fantasy vii introduces a new time based system for battle sequences
instead of taking turns hitting each other the time based system makes it so that you have to wait a specific amount of time to attack again
the world map lets you travel anywhere and do almost anything
with stunning cinematography and dazzling graphics final fantasy vii is truly the cream of the crop and the best role playing game this world has ever seenbottom line arguably the best game for the playstation console
final fantasy vii caps them allthis is one of the best final fantasy games there is it rewrote the video gaming at the time and introduced a new system of magic and weapons to the ff series
it is a lot of fun to play and i would buy it again if my copy ever got damagedfinal fantasy vii has the absolute best storyline in an rpg
period
i know very few if any people who have started and not finished this game with a smile
its extremely addictive and you wont get bored with it before you finish it
i just love this game so muchi just finished writing a review of the excellent soundtrack to this game and realised i hadnt even written a review for the game so here goes
in my opinion this is the greatest video game of any genre of all time
the final fantasy series in general is probably my favourite series of games awaiting xii eagerly and vii is the best of allwhat makes it the best
it has to be the plot which by gaming standards is superb the angst driven main character is overdone in rpgs but it works to good effect here
sephiroth is another reason he is the best badguy in a game ever he is just pure evil
he causes the plot to be more unpredictable than your average rpg who honestly expected him to kill aeris when they first played through
main characters rarely die in these sort of games
it is just a joy to play in every sense the mini games compliment it well including in the gold saucer
the soundtrack is great of course the graphics are now dated but it doesnt detract from the gameplay at all a true masterpiece if you dont own it already you couldnt do any better than to buy it nowi have played thousands of games spent countless hours on them
i have played the best with titles such as grand theft auto vice city and i have played some of the worst like total recall
however throughout all the games that i have played only one stands out as the number one game of all time
that title is final fantasy what makes final fantasy  so great especially considering the past titles the sequels and other great titles such as dragon warrior series breath of fire and so on
it has a special something that few games really have
any game can draw you into a story hell old nes titles such as ninja gaiden and zelda could do that
however what makes this so great is that it is one of the select few titles in the relm of video gmaes that can do something that no other games can but i shall reveal that later
lets talk about the gamefinal fantasy  starts off like an action movie might
you control cloud strife an exsoldier equivelent to the  navy seals who is now a mercenary for hire
he is currently working for the terrorist organization known as avalanche ran by barrett a big burly black man with a chaingun for a hand
his second in command is a girl named tifa who was a childhood friend of clouds
after a few succesful missions cloud is seperated from the team where he meets up with a young girl named aeris
little does cloud realize at first is that aeris is beign pursued by the conglomerate shinra shinra is what avalanche is trying to bring down
cloud decideds to help her out but when she is kidnapped he must rescue her
meanwhile a ghost from the past returns to not only haunt him but destroy the worldthis is the main focus of the first few hours
the story itself will slowly evolve into something that if you show dedication to than you will be very satisfied when it is all said and done
now lets talk about some technical aspectsthe graphics for the time are outstanding however when compared to today it is proof of how dated graphics can get quicklycontrols are fluent enough and the menues are asy to scroll throughcombat is never really one sided however if you dont build up your levels by the end of disk one should be level  or higher for the whole party you will be whippedthe music is what seperates this from most games
the music is the pinacle of greatness here
as i am writing this i am listening to aeris theme which is one of the greatest tracks in gaming history
this alone seperates this from most gaems past and presenthowever there is one factor that seperates this from most games
the secret to why this one of he best is that it is one of the few games that can touch you emotionally
any game can give you an adrenaline rush
however it is very select few gaems that can touch you emotionally and even make you cry
final fantasy  has accomplished this
this is one of the select few titles that has ever done this
to date the only other title to do this is the cult hit icoin conclusion final fantasy  is the greatest game of all time because it has an incredible story incredibel music and the fact that you will be sucked in if you give it time
but that is the thing you must give it time and dedication
this is however the greatest game of all timeand i finally got my own copy a few days ago
the graphics for the characters are blocky but i like them because they make me think of legos and it amuses me
i think the quality of the graphics actually work better in certain scenes like with don corneo
betterupdated graphics would ruin the whole corny angle
though updated movie scenes would be nice
the playable characters are nicely varied from all walks of life
of course i hate the timeconsuming leveling up part as i do in all rpgs though the materia addons are the best ones i like of the final fantasy series so farplayed them all from the original up to xii with the exception of v and ix
the story does take a while to get interesting but that doesnt bother me too much with all the side quests availablemy  year old plays this so i dont know anything to say except she loves it as does my wifeas the title says this game is old but its still epic
im a huge fan of the ffvii saga and im glad that i got this because i played the other one so much that i had to get another one
i must be getting rusty because the boss battles in here ive had some trouble with
but as always i find a way to beat them allif some are use to playing d games thenuhhdude go back to d if youre a true gamer
even after  years the grafics are good the fighting is awesome and the story is always as epic as ever knowing that its from square enix
ha i just feel old playing this and im not even  yet
but its a really good game and you should play it for sureea need to remake this exciting game for ps or ps no doubt about it
they need to have hardcore nfs gamers back  bring back what made nfs  need for speed
not autolog or alldrive crap   player racer with criterions hotpursuit graphic is all we needthis is a great game
lots of fun
if you are a game collector i would suggest you grab this game you cant go wrong with this game
the character schemes the fighting mechanics the playstyle the music the stages they are all extraordinary
youre gonna like this game for sure i guarantee iti love this innovative game
the combat system is so fun
picking up objects and throwing them at your oponents will give you significant advantage over them
the transformation after you collect all three power stones is so cool
i like the fact that everyone gets a chance to evolve and to become the strongest fighterpower stone is one of the great gems on the dreamcast
this game was a breakthrough among fightingaction games
it is a d versus fighter with tons of special moves destructable environments weapons and other items you can pick up and use environmental traps and gadgets that can help or hinder you and environmental objects you can use to jump off of climb on tear down etc
it is a combination capture the flagfighter where everyone goes dashing around for powerups and attacks each other to get them to drop their power stones
once someone collects all the power stones they go into their super mode and it becomes a game of cat and mouse until the effects wear off and the power stones fly off in random directions
this game is totally fun totally original and totally worth buying a dreamcast if only to play this one gamedo you like fighting games but wish they had a little more depth
well then power stone might be for you
its a great game where the d arenas fast speed crazy weapons and powerup moves really get your heart pumping
everything here can be used to your advantage from street polls to swing on to boxes amp cafe chairs to throw
the different environments really give you something to look at and each player has their own unique power moves
unlike other games this game makes you look for power stones which transform you into a person with enhanced powers
then they can really do some damage
just getting to the stones first will be hard enough along with defeating your foe
its a cool game and i highly reccomend itpower stone is a fun filled action game that every one will likeit has fast action
fast pace baby
the way i like itthe desighn is great
the level desighn in power stone is awesomegameplay is great
thats what its all about
gameplay
its also easy to use and learn
the game will last for awhile but you will eventually get bored with it
but not for awhilethis game is greati give it its really good trust mei havent played power stone  though
but get this gamelaterthere are so many reviews of this top game around that i will keep to the vital points
is this the best resident evil game yet
yes it looks absolutely fantastic but due to familiarity its not as scary any more unless you have no idea what to expect
the zombies dont even fall to pieces in chunks any more
why
is it in complete d
no
this was hyped up prerelease but the truth is that although the camera follows the characters around a little all scenes are viewed from selected semifixed view points and you cannot look around at will
shame
if you make it through to the bonus game you can play in first person and really see the amount of detail present in those scenes
i actually like the fixed perspective of these games as it looks so cinematic but imagine the whole game with this freedom is it value for money
yes
this is a long game that rewards some serious time investment
there are many many locations and places to explore however although it is a very long game its not that difficult
claire has to battle the tyrant in the back of a plane halfway through and this is the only really tough challenge the rest of the encounters are a bit on the easy side
you should not die much if you are a seasoned player
but the positive details override these small letdowns
everything looks real
locations and characters are perfectly realised and claires lighter provides a really beautiful effect
the sounds and music are also excellent you get to play as three people and what a story dreamcast owners can really boast about this addition to segas line up and it has to be one of the musthaves of the systemthe resident evil games have long been a playstation staple having had three wildly successful games in the series
well move over playstation because the franchise is moving to dreamcast and going hiresresident evil code veronica takes place between resident evil  and  and once again features claire redfield and her brother chris
this time claire is being held prisoner on an umbrellaowned zombie infested island far away from racoon city
on her desperate attempt to escape the island claire meets several characters  some helpful but most not so helpfulcode veronica plays exactly like the other resident evil games ive got them all so if you like that style of control youre in business here
what really sets code veronica apart from its siblings however are the graphics
i think i can confidently say that this is the best looking zombie game ever made
you can see every pusoozing sore on those pathetic zombies and environments are fully rendered in dthis game is a slamdunk if you like the survival horror genrethis is the resident evil game that all people have been waiting for even if they dont realize it yet
it was so good that it refused to die with the failing dreamcast and dove across to the play station   i hear the graphics arent as good on ps
it is the ultimate survival horror gamewhat make veronica so great
the graphics are no small part
sure i reveled like the rest of us in the exploding zombie heads of re  and  but i loved the brain splatter of veronica
the tyrant from re  with his blank stare and overcoat never conveyed the sheer life of a bendersnatch as he trapezed across the room and crushed your head all the while looking at you with those oh so human eyeswhat else you ask makes this game the re
well the story is superbly done and alexia is the mostawesome bad guyerrrgirl that has ever graced the screen
and all your old favorites are back too so expect to see some old friends and new enemies as you crawl and run aroundoh and there is more
guns have always been great in the resident evil games but these guns are crisp
by that i mean they may not be aweimspiring like the electroshocker from  or as satisfying as the enhanced shotgun rounds from  but they will do the job exactly like you would expect
the twin uzis will stop a zombie in its tracks but the spiders will laugh as they pump poison into you
but you can show them who is boss with a blast from the grenade launcher now better built to kill groups
across the board the guns will satisfyand there is just so much else that i cannot write it all
but needless to say if you own a dc or ps this is a good purchase at any price
get it buy it steal it love it
come be a zombie killer with the rest of usi played re and loved it but code veronica for dreamcast was everything that was great about the series and completely perfected itperfect atmospherescary musicspot on controlsdevious puzzlesand of coursezombies zombies and more zombiesgorgeous graphics stunning for its timea story line that advanced the whole series quite a biti really have nothing bad to say about the gamethe only thing i didnt like then is the same thing i dont like nowthe crate pushingwhy is there crate pushing in every re gamehow often do you need to push crates in real life to get from one area to anotherits not like i walk down the street during lunch break and encounter random crates on the sidewalkit might be kind of cool if i did thoughgranted i dont run into zombies eitherhmmmmdo the working people downtown countill have to say yes to that onenever mindre code veronicatook the formula of the original re and perfected ita must play for survival horror fansrecommendedthanks again i didnt know if the other feedback went through or not but i wanted to make sure you got a good review and thanks for the valentines day wrapping sweet as everisnt it time they brought claire back
and not in no operation raccoon city neither
five four three two oneevery part of this game has been permanently burned into the recesses of my brain
maybe not the specifics of plot or location only the fear that sheer terror i had from beginning to end
this is what video games are all about  the ability to step inside a movie or novel and live those incredible moments as if they were your own
i forgot i was sitting safely in my house my life was on that screenif that doesnt tell you this game is good i dont know what to write
the plot is unbelievable the graphics are unbelievable the game is unbelievable the only problem i have is that you arent really motivated to play it again after you finish it but the game is really long so im not too disappointed
ive had a ps since xmas and i still havent seen graphics to beat this game
the story rivals my favorite movies and i hate video game plotsi have to admit that i had never been much of a fan of the resident evil series on play station
but then code veronica came out on dreamcast and i quickly became a convert to the school of quotsurvival horrorquot after watching my brother lay waste to a few zombies
this game will have you on edgethe story is suspenseful and the enemies who pop out from behind corners can even make your heart jump if you try playing at night with the lights off
this is an a title that belongs in every gamers collection
even if you didnt like the other games in the resident evil series code veronica will thrill youthe latest inclusion in the resident evil series is quite simply the best thus far with some fantastic if obvious plot twists it leaps ahead in the survival horror genreim sure you all know the story by no so ill comment on the graphics which are still awesome this is without a doubt the best game on dreamcast even a year after its release it still crushes most other games
the gameplay is only slightly improved from the originals but hell if it aint broke why fix it the game is well structured with a variety of puzzles suspense and plenty of actionunlike the rest of the games in the series if you didnt like the others this game will
change your mind fans of any genre with love and respect this game for years to come and justifiably so
the voice acting is spot on and the characters facial details when they talk is phenomenal to the extent that it at times surpasses the almighty shenmue
in conclusion this is one game that defiantly does the dreamcast justicefollow claire redfield of resident evil  as she searches for her lost brother chris only to uncover another sinister plot to unleash a horrible curse on the world in the name of love
rescue your brother only to be rescued by him
code veronica made for an awesome prehalloween gaming experience kicking back in a bean bag chair with a bag of candy corn and the lights turned down low
code veronica is the true third installment in the franchise but given capcoms contract with sony to produce a mainseries title on their playstation system their nemesis spinoff took this games place and regrettably
veronica is certainly a better game with a better plot better graphics and better gameplay
additionally veronica marks the series last game in the survival horror genre before resident evil  branched the series into an onrails pseudoshooter actionadventure nightmare no pun intended this analysis is accurately and justifiably harsh
it is the only game for the dreamcast all in all worth playing
it makes little use of the hardwares potential and is only enjoyable insofar as it is a resident evil gameresident evil code veronica
if i could only say four words about this game what would it bebuy it right nowif you liked the classy feel and mood of the prere games with the shuffling zombies limited health and your nervous system going haywire because so many signs in the game scream danger then this is definitely a game for youhowever just let you know this game does still have the clunky tank controls associated with re games
however due to the dreamcasts analog stick it will be slightly easier to master the steering of this game then for instance the gamecube remakestoryroughly three months after claire redfield leon s kennedy and sherry birkin escaped raccoon city claire has found her way to paris france the main headquarters of umbrella europe inc she infiltrates but after a stunning cinema that impress even to this day she goes down fighting hardroughly  days later wkd aka claire redfield is transported to rockford island a prison facility and military training ground
while there a bombing raid occurs releasing the tvirus onto the island
claires wounded prison guard releases her but warns that there is no way off this islandhowever res favorite rebel biker sets out to prove him wrong fighting hordes of the undead along with freak mutations while meeting some enemy faces like the ashfords and some slightlyirritating ones like steve burnside
while there she stumbles upon secrets about the islands owners the ashfords and dark secrets on the history of umbrella taking her as far south as one could imagine and even towing her lost brother chris into the mixwhy would i recommend this game
the challenge
this game is very good at starving you of health
probably the second half of the first disc i was wandering about in danger hoping to find at least a green herb while trying to keep the undead and mutants away from mehowever like re it makes up the lack of health with a crap load of ammunition
if you play your cards right nearly half of your inventory at the end of the game before the final boss will be back with guns and ammunition
your classic re weapons are here shotgun handgun grenade launcher etc but so many new types are added its not funnyalso the knife and bow gun in this game they are overpowered
four slashes can kill your average zombie
about  bow gun arrows will take a zombie down as opposed to the  slashes and arrows in re
not to mention that if you combine regular bow gun arrows with explosive powder you have the most powerful weapon in the game
however there are not many of these in the gamethe story is very clean as it progresses taking numerous twists and turns throughout but still being easy to followthe characters are hitandmiss for most
chris and claire are spot on along with a familiar face from a previous game
steve can get a bit annoying but by the time you get to the second disc hell either have grown on you or youll loathe his guts
the ashfords while annoying have their parts done perfectlyafter completing the game
which first time around will probably take about  hours you unlock a battle mode reminiscent of the saturn port of re
its entertaining although limitedjust to note maybe except re ive not played that game yet this game has fewer unlockables then most other re games
you only get the battle mode a special weapon for battle mode after aranking that and a special weapon for normal mode if you can complete the game under  hours with no deaths no firstaid sprays no saves except for the one they prompt you with between discs and no continues
while the first half of the game could easily be done that way the second half is near impossible with the shudders hunters and claires final puzzle in the last part of the last disc
there are no bonus costumes save for claires alternate in the battle mode no other extra weapons etc
compare that to re with alternate costumes extra weapons galore ext battle mode and hunktofu storyjust to let you know this game can be purchased for the ps and gc with some added cutscenes in those versions
however for me having the original dreamcast feel is where its at
if you own a dreamcast or any console that carries this game go for itthis is the best in the re series yet
it looks wonderful on dreamcast
clear and fluid graphics with solid gameplay
the ability to use  weapons  in  different directions is a new feature that has really added to  gameplay and gives the player an opportunity to make it safely through  tight situations
it is a must buy if you have a new dreamcast make this  one of your first gamesive been playing re since it first came out for ps and back then it scared the living daylights out of me
nowadays it still is
this game is just too good to pass up
i highly recommend everyone to buy this game if you are even just a slight fan of the series
i hate myself for waiting this long to buy it
by the way when you first see those arm stretchers prepare to have an extra pair of bvds on hand
yikesok ill admit when i first saw that sega was going to take over the production part of the game i hesistated
being a fan of the resident evil series i thought that it shouldve stayed with sony
all of the games on sony except for thesurvivor shooting game were awesome bringing me to new levels of terror and fear
code veronica however surpasses them all to the point where you will have nightmaresthe story takes place a bit after res  which happened before and during res  if you can keep up
claire redfield while looking for her brother chris has been captured by umbrella and detained on an uncharted island
of course zombies come out from nowhere and claire has to find a way to get off the island
the plot is top notch and some parts had me going what the heck
 while the creatures had me saying other words i shouldnt say
the game is engrossing and with the addition of a dark room and surround sound its really creepy
creaking sounds and footsteps will have you wondering whats behind door  giant spiders make quick thumpthumpthump sounds with their legs before they come to chew on you and the beasts are rendered nicely in a scareyousilly kind of way
the puzzles will make you think as checking everything you collect is the only way to get throughthe graphics are excellent as shading and cutscenes are beautiful to watch
when claire lights her lighter its a sight to behold as it flickers realistically
the only problem is the clunky control as it seems to populate this series a lot
its a problem but one you can adapt to and youd better before you become lunch meatthe replay value comes in the battle game
beat the game and that becomes available successfully complete a puzzle in the game and steve becomes available
you can play as claire chris redfield steve or wesker each complete with certain weapons weskers game is insane you only fight with a knifeall in all with the dreamcast becoming more affordable id suggest you pick this game up
its easily the best of the seriessimply put code veronica is the best in the series
after re i didnt think the series could get any better but i was wrong
cv had an amazing graphics and a superb camera system
the story was huge and awesome so this was the most time consuming re at the time
i think the remake of re on the gamecube is longer and  times scarier than the psx version
if you have a gamecube or dc and love adventureactionhorror games than code veronica and the rest of the series is definately for youwithout a doubt the best resident evil game ever made quotcode veronicaquot will amaze you with its beauty and scare the hell out of you with its zombie shooting action
the graphics are super superb looking almost movie like and giving you such a surreal feeling its like your interacting with a movie rather than playing a game
and like true horror should be theres plenty of thrills chills and a hell of a lot of spills to behold
never has being scared senseless been so fun
essential for the dreamcast ownerthis is the ultimate resident evil
it has way better graphics better sound a better story everything is better but it does feel just like  the old resident evil game it has the same feel to it
if you dont have  this dont consider yourself a fan of the seriesthis is truly the best resident evil made so far
when i first turned it on and watched the first opening movie i was amazed
the graphics are great
so after that i got the first moment of gameplay
same controls
im used to em but they were a little difficult to master when i played the first resident evili go up the stairs what are there
zombies
different zombies actually
there graveyard zombies
i have a knife and try and kill em
i somehow do it
im thinking ugh this game is gonna be hard
what do i do
keep playing and run oit of ammo fast and die
if you really want to be able to beat this game you need to buy some kind of strategy guide or something
so why are you reading this
go buy the game
its the best so farthis resident evil is the best out of the lot
the graphics on this are the best that i have seen of any resident evil game and the puzzles have been taken afurther which i am glad about  as in all of the other rsident evils all of the puzzles were similar
the game is longer than all of the other resident evils and in like some of the previous games you get to take on the roles of other characters
the zombies are more intelligent and there seems to be a better feel to this game than all the others
congratulations to sega for producing the best game out of the serieswhen i bought code veronica i was an amateur with resident evil game but after playing two discs of resident evil pleasure i can beat any resident evil game
gaming is my profession so the game wasnt too hard to beat for me but it would be on a scale of  the hardness is an  for average gamer so be resident evil experienced befor you buy this great game but other than that the game is excellent so the  doesnt matter the game play is worth iti didnt expect this game to be so fun
i just picked it up just expecting to shoot things
i couldnt of been anymore wrong
this game is the best game out for the dreamcast
no question in my mind
first off you just dont shoot thing
there is actually a real plot to this game
which sometimes lacks in others in this genre
there are puzzles to solve so you actually have to think to play
but the best feature in this game is the mood
its just so morbid you feel like your in the game
no joke
if i see a zombie i start to wigout
it draws you in
i really cant describe it
the only way youll know what im talking about is to play the game
its the greatestresident evil codeveronica was the best selling game on the dreamcast
luckily for the ps owners capcom has ported a version for their system
but it all started on segas system
cv was the first game in the series to feature highly detailed polygon backgrounds tapping into the power of the dc
this coupled with some of the deepest most challenging frightening gameplay in the entire series and you have a game that is a musthave for both dreamcast collectors or those who need absolutely every re game ever madelike i said ive played a lot of street fighter games in several arcades and im truly amazed with each and every one of them except for some of the street fighter ex series
street fighter alpha  and  were excellent games and they sold well in the console market
street fighter alpha  improved over all of the street fighter games when it first came to the arcade and playstation
when the dreamcast came out i had second thoughts about the playstation version
i have no problem with the playstation version but the only thing i hated about it was the loading times
on the superior dreamcast version there are absolutely no loading times in this one
the graphics moved at a solid framerate the gameplay still remained solid and for the first time ever you can duke it out with people from around the world using online play 
this is the first street fighter game to ever achieve and online play feature
remember that sorry excuse for a street fighter dan hibiki 
well his shinku gadouken can go faster and farther but stops at a certain point and now it looks bigger than before 
you get to play as several characters like evil ryu fei long the bruce lee lookalike t hawk e honda ken chun li ryu charlie blanka rainbow mika gen and more 
wanna add a street fighter game in your dreamcast library 
get this one if youre reading this then this game may not be for you
i say that because the type of person whod enjoy this game most likely already owns it
if however youre looking to see what the dreamcast version has to offer or youre trying to break into the genre read onfirst and foremost fans of strictly d fighters a la tekken soul calibur or dead or alive need not apply
this game is d only and if youve grown accustomed to the slower pacing of most d fighters the transition can be a bit of a shock
you should know what it is exactly that youre buying before you order
also this game isnt the best looking d fighter you can buy
while it certaintly looks nice it doesnt look really any better than the arcade version as far as character animation and such goesso why the  star rating
simple
the gameplay
this game has it in droves and this isnt the instant pickitupandmasteritinminutes kind of gameplay
the multiple single player missions character saves three different isms and the overall deep build of the game make it seem more like an extremely high speed game of chess than a  fighter
a good player can soundly trounce those with less experience and its very rare that a new player can sometimes oneup a veteran through luck and button mashing
tekken has this problem though some dont consider it a problem
i however prefer a system that rewards those with the patience to master it
to each his ownthis game can and will teach you if youre willing to learn however
a very good single player element lets you build up your characters in a quasirpgish manner
the better you fight the more points you have to spend on making your character more powerful
you newly beefed character can either be left to complete the single player missions on his own which are very creative and fun with set objectives like beat  characters at once or use only super moves or can be exported to the arcade or vs modes
for added fun find a friend with a character hes made and pit your two characters against each other
or just play it in regular old arcade mode which is perfectly translated and looks just perfect on the dreamcast
if you thought the psx version looked nice wait till you see this
it wont turn any heads who are used to d but as far as  d goes it looks mighty good considering the age of the gameall in all an excellent choice if you consider yourself oldschool fighting gamer and have the patience to learn
for those who prefer quick painless flashy and shallow look elsewherefor those in the know this is capcom in top formi have been playing fighting games all my life mostly mortal kombatstreet fightervirtua fighter and tekken gamesi recently bought this game on amazonand its so much fun in dramatic battle p coop against the computer
this game is such an awesome game and has so many different fighting modes to choose fromi like the world tour mode you build up up your character every time you beat an opponentthis game is like the playstation game except the graphics and sound are way betteralso their is little or no loadingthis version is just like the arcade version except their is more modes and more replay valuetheir is so many charactersbut some are almost the same like juli and cammy they have almost the same movesthe fighting is almost the same as street fighter but it has fighting styles like aismsvismsand xisms they are just different ways to do super movesmy favorite fighter is shin akumai played street fighter rd strike and i prefer this game over it because this one has more modes and extra charactersthis game plays just like super street fighter  turbo which is another classic gamethis game is recommend if you like the street fighter or just like d fighting gamesthis game is really fun when you play it on a xarcade joystick or hori arcade stick with a ps adapter to get the arcade experiencepros great selection of fighterstons of modesfun p coop modefun game for playing with your friendsarcade perfectcons too many similar charactersnot everyone likes d gamesi bought this because i had recently aquired a dreamcast and i wanted to collect games for it
i bought it because it was fairly priced but when i received it in the mail to my surprise it was in perfect condition
it felt like the original owner took care of his stuff as the package it self was carefully madeif you thought street fighter alpha  was great in the arcade you aint seen nothin yet
the graphics are crisp clean and very colorful and the best part is there is virtually no loading time whatsoever
the world tour mode is great and the regular arcade mode is still as fun as its always been and at this price id get it now if i were you cause it wont be around for much longerstreet fighter alpha  is what the dreamcast needs at the moment ands thats an excellent fighting game that is familiar with everone
all of your favourite characters are in the game ranging from vega and chunli to deejay and cammy
there are various modes of play and the two player option makes this game more appealing as you will have great fun repeatedly beating your friendsgreat but you can get the entire alpha collection for cheap on the ps nowadaysstill a classicthis is an amazing fighting game you can pick from  characters which include in orderchun li  ryu  zangiefmorrigan  captain commando  mega manstrider hiryu  spiderman  jincaptain america  venom  hulkgambit  war machine  wolverinethe fighting is awsome when you connect on a hyper combo you can go from  hits to  and beyond
if you are very good you might be able to connect on a good aerial combo
sure this aint no marvel vs capcom  but this is still a great game
the last boss is onslaught which i find to be pretty hard and frustrating at times the modes in this game arearcadeversussurvivaltrainingcross feverin this game ryu can transform into either ken or akuma pretty neat and all with moves of their own
charecters with some of the stronget specials would be in my opinionzangiefwar machine ryuakuma and jin
but the best player to use for combos would have to be strider if you know how to use him he could possibly be the deadliest character in the game
heres a little secret once you have beaten the comp or your friend when right after it says ko and the stats appear press start and then you will be able to move around and attack your opponents dead body
but i seriously think you should see your doctor first before playing this because the flashes in this game are extreme the specials make the screen flash in many different ways that can make one have a seizure or get dizzy
but this game is a milestone in fighting game historypros fast paced flashy super moves  characters per team rd characters acts as assist only the team hyper moves are actually a bit better than in marvel vs capcom  in my opinion combo system allows for many consecutive hits colorful levels more comic book looking than marvel vs capcom   different characters to unlock great cast of characters will keep you entertained for hours day weeks and possibly even months two player mode will keep you entertained for years the dreamcast version of this game is much better than the playstation version
they removed tag team fighting from the playstation version due to its memory limitation
that takes a lot of fun out of the gamecons if any it would be for there to be more characters
considering when it was released it does have a very large character lineupi said it before and ill say it again in a different way
im a d fighting veteran and i know which d fighter is worth playing all over again and which is worth ditching
however the playstation version of marvel vs capcom is just one of those games that needs to be ditched except for the dreamcast conversion
unlike its unworthy playstation apprentice the dreamcast version of marvel vs capcom is  arcade perfect in every way 
allow me to give the lowdown on this game 
the graphics are far by the best ive seen
although they seem a bit dated to some people who never played or doubt the vs series the animation is seamless with no frames chopped off
the characters look brighter and they move much faster and smoother than that of the arcade version
including the backgrounds which looks very colorful but some of them looks like theyre featured in an enhanced bit game
but despite of that the dreamcasts power is capable of making d fighters look better than any other d fighters on different home consoles
the sound still remains the same as the arcade and psx original
the music sounds fairly catchy but couldve been better if qsound hadnt made the music too loud and too flashy to bother even the most patient person in the house
as for the sound effects almost as similar to that of the earlier vs series but much improved
youll still hear a whole lot of the same punching noises and the same hits taken from a super beam or a flame toasted fist
and for the voice acting the same again but the only voice that changed was ryus
his character sprite may be based on the original street fighter alpha character but capcom designed him to give him his old red headband he had while he was growing older and make his voice sound a little deeper
as for the gameplay very well done
the psx controls didnt do much of the justice but the design of the dreamcast control fits the gameplay very well
with the dc controller marvel vs capcom plays like a charm 
yes my friendsits that good 
and plus you get the tag feature where you can switch your characters anytime you want especially when your first character is losing energy
and as for the game modes you get five of them which should be enough to please you
you still get the arcade mode along with the  player vs mode survival mode cross fever mode and training mode
as for the selection of characters its okayi guess
you get characters from the marvel universe from the us and the capcom universe from japan
on the capcom side weve got ryu chunli zangief mega man strider hiryu jin morrigan captain commando and roll as a secret character
on the marvel comics side weve got wolverine spiderman venom gambit hulk and war machine
the marvel side does have its share of secret characters but all of them are alternatives of the same character
but still while the dc conversion has some flaws its still arcade perfect and furthermore it has no loading times
marvel vs capcom for the dreamcast is one game that shouldnt be left behind
i know what youre saying
i didnt really explain that much detail on the playstation version
but the reason why is because its hard to explain complete details about a horrible port of a true capcom classic
the dc version was simple to explain because it defined arcade perfect with a vengeance 
like i said if you want the true marvel vs capcom experience play the arcade version or just play this one 
youll be proud you did i absolutely had to have this game when it came out
it was such a great time when console games were finally living up to there arcade counterparts and even surpassing them in waysmvc had better graphics than the arcade
in marvel vs capcom you select two fighters composed of either marvel or capcom charactersor both
you can switch between them during the fight which hadnt been done yet on home consoles due to ram limitations
such a great game and im glad to have it in the collection because its as good as having the arcade machine itselfyou pick from  charactersryustridermega manzangiefmorrigancaptain commando captain americaspider manvenomjinhulkwolverinechun ligambitwar machineonslaught is the boss in this gameakumaken and onslaught are playable with a codethis game is fun and has hyper fast gameplaythe game has  characters which is not that muchbut it is made up in fastnice gameplaysome people whine about the graphics and say its bad and compare it to tekken those games are not in the same categorythe d games are drawn and d games are polygon based graphics they are different types of thingsthe dreamcast joystick is no longer madebut still want to play the game i got a solutionget a playstation  adapter and buy a ps or psone joystick and then have fun just like the arcadei recommend this game to people who like the other cross over games like xmen children of the atom marvel super heroes vs street fighter
this version is the best because its arcade perfect and its to pick up and play  when you feel like fighting your heroespros fast gameplay great graphics awesome charactersfun to playpull off huge comboswhen using the arcade stick enhances gameplaycons not enough characters dreamcast controller not good for this game d graphics not for everyonethis is just as perfect as the arcade version
however i did find that the music is a bit hyped up comparing to the arcade
too bad there isnt really any new secrets in the game
the only thing i still dont like is that out of all the versus series marvel vs capcom has the worsest looking energy bars for your fighters
the dreamcast control pad isnt too great for this game either especially when you try to do striders  hit chain combo from jabroundhouse
still just dont let the controls bother you and if you are willing to spend  for the arcade stick then this game is definetly for youintrook who would pass up an oppertunaty like this unless of course you have the chance to buy the nd one better but yet not as valuable as the first considering they dont make the first marvel vs capcom any more
this game has crisp anamation smooth gameplay cristal clear sound and an awsome soundtrack that pumps you up and gets you in the mood for fightingin the game anyway
dont pass up this golden oppertunity get it if you can find it
first one also available for the sony playstation and nd one also for the sega dreamcast and sony playstation  and soon for microsoft xbox and nintendo gamecubecharactersthe list of characters consist of the following from the capcom universechunliryuwith ken and akuma modezangiefmorrigancaptaincommandomegamanstriderjinfrom the marevel universespidermancaptain americavenomthe incredible hulkgambitwar machinewolverinesecretfrom the capcom universelilithshadow ladyrollmech zangieffrom the marevel universegold war machinehyper venomorange hulkonslaughtscore the character roster could have includedarmored spidermanblackheartcammycyber akumacyclopsdandark sakuradhalsimjuggernautmagnetombisonmephistonashomega redroguesabretoothsakurashadowshuma gorathstormusagentok they did include a few of them but only as helpers if they made them as default playable characters this game would have been way more  awesome than it already is and that would totaly rule
gameplaythe gameplay is based on how fast and fun the game has and how much slowdown the game experiences during playthe gameplay is lighting fast with absolutly no slowdown when i play it unless it is so little and the game is so fast paced that its not noticeable and that just makes the game even better
the game is also ultimate fun especially with playing with the younger kids because the look on their face is priceless and hillarios when you pull off a huge combo with a great character like megaman for examplescore soundsound score is based upon voice overs sfx and musicthe music st of all is awesome they use origonal music from origonal games it starts off with the ps st character music like if ps st character is megaman then it starts off with megamans music used in the game then after a character is killed the next character to pop up has hisher music played like if megaman is koed then the nd characters music for that team plays
the sfx rule they are so good thats all there is to say
the voice overs are perfect in every way and couldnt be any more precice to the charactersscore graphics the graphics in this game are so beautiful and unbelievably awesome looking that you cant even believe why they didnt do this in the earlier vs games
if the graphics look this good on the st for dreamcast then they have to look way better on the nd for the dreamcast and they do
i definetly have to give the graphicsscore overall this is not an average this is what i think about the whole game as awhole game anywayscore get the game unless you cant find it then get the nd onebuy
best graphics on the dreamcast that ive seen and fun gameplay to bootold school but great fightingyou know the only reason i wanted dreamcast was for this game
i didnt care for other games except this game
this game rocks
the graphics  are the best i have every seen and there are like  moves for each charator
the great thing about this is that you can unlock charactors after you have beaten the game with other charators
there is also mission mode where you go on quotsmall missionquot and then you can unlock stuff like stages and special features there is practice mode which i find very useful because i can practice my moves without getting disturbed or attacked by other players
my personal favorite is maxi because i luv the nunchaku and the moves look so good and his moves are easy and powerful
my least favorite charactor is yoshimitsu because he is weak and doesnt have very powerful attacks
i have the prima official strategy book and that tells be all the secrets about this awesome game
let me tell you a little about the story line
there was once a night of cervantes and he had the soul blade
he was a great knight and ruled for many years until taki and sophita destroyed theall these charators you can play in the game
so one day a young german knight named siegfried came across cervantes body
the body burst into flames and siegfried is now nightmare
you are trying to get the soul edge and deafeat infernothis game is very interesting because of its story and the way the charactors battle
there is going to be a soul calibur  for playstation  gamecube and xbox
i cant wait to get it because this game is the best game of all time
i still think that this game is the only good game for dreamcast
they sohld make this game for every system like the tony hawk series becase this is a great fighting gamelet me tell you about maxi
his weapon is the nunchaku and it is very fast and only very experienced people  could see his moves soming
they are also very coolto watch
you might find yourself trying to do those movesi tried to do them he has a lot of combosthe most powerful person is nightmare
he has the soul blade and can destroy a lot of things in his way
but beware
his moves are sooo slow everyone can counter themthe weakest person i would say is taki or another chinese girl
the are fast and efficient but you would find yourself trying to puch and pull
they arent that strong
to make up their strengh they have quick speeds and fast attackshere is a study for the boss inferno
he is a flame and to my opinion the hardest to beat
he only has like  moves of his own but every time you battle him he can be one of any of the fighters
when i mean that he has a same weopon as that fighter and the same moves but he is still a ball of flame
his moves are really powerful and you can like take the person out in like  moves
his stage is in space and very creepy compared to some of the other stagesedge master is just like inferno except he doesnt have any quotonly himquot moves
he is the master of weapons but not as powerful as inferno
he is a old man who has a very long beard
his hair is either red or white depending on his costumeahh
soul calibur is a excellent game and i hope if you have a dreacast buy this gamethanks for taking the time to read my reviewalan yone of the few games i actually bought for the dreamcast while i owned onei was raised on a steady diet of mortal kombat and nothing really prepared me for how hard this game wasill keep it shortthe graphics
astoundingthe game play
a brutal revelationincredible story linesthis game can be picked up and played by anyone but trust meon the more difficult settings this is no button masheryou better know your character inside and out or you wont last a minuteill sum it upawesome weapons based combatone of the deepest fighters out therenot for the fighting faint of heartrecommendeduntil soul calibur  hits the shelves i am not going to disconnect my dreamcast
soul calibur is still the best game ever and for the prices they are now is better to buy a dreamcast and this game than to buy a  game for any other consoleeven with the new consoles on the market this game is still the best fighting game out there
just so you all know the dreamcast is a  bit system just like the others
so the graphics can be just as good
could have used a few more fighters but thats my only complaint
the backgounds are breath taking
the fighters have the coolest specials moves ive ever seen
and the special moves arnt really all that hard to use
you can get to them a lot of times with just a bit of luck
some of the other fighting games ive played i was never able to make them do the really cool moves because they were too complicated to pull off
so i never got to see them
this is a must have game for dreamcast ownersrevisionthis is still the best fighting game out
even with the xbox and ps out
me and a friend still hook up the old dreamcast to play this from time to time
cant wait untill the next one
as of this new review this will selling on amazoncom for more than it was when dreamcast was still out
i guess that tells you a little something about how good this game isi got this game back in  when i first got my dreamcast
this game is still coming out with sequels
i think that this is a great gamethis game was the best thing that came from the dreamcast aside from house of the dead
this was one of my main reasons for getting the dreamcast
the graphics were awesome and the replay to this game was greatthe second installment of the very popular arcade smash soul blade had much better graphics than the first very fluid fights new characters that rocked and also a surprise cameo by tekkens yoshimitsu
plus a lot of new weapons and fighting styles like a  staff a sword with a chain attached to it the shaolin sword style and even some returing favorites like the short sword and samurai swordthis game rocked
i still play this game eventhough the dreamcast is more or less no more
this is a great game if yuou have a dreamcast you need this game
its almost a requirementi have been a fan of fighters for some time now old and new and one seems to stand out
soul calibur is the fastest strongest and most entertaining of all
its got everything a fighter should have with no hang ups at all
a large selection of characters loads of unlockable ones as well number of stunning arenas and multiple modes of game play that will never get boring
i reccomend this title to any gamer no matter what you like
cant go wrong
the best fighter to date weapons downgreat game one of the best for dreamcast especially if you like fighting games
if your just picking up a dreamcast and looking at games and own the later soul caliburs sc are out at the time of this review you will in my oppinion still find this game enjoyable its fell is much the same as sc
though i personaly enjoy this sc over scthe only con to this game is the lack of costumes for characters most have two a select few have an unlockable rd
also mission mode is a little on the short side a little easier then sc
other then those two things this is a great game
a must have for dci have owned my dreamcast for nearly a yera now and had been waiting to find a solid fighting game
many people say that tekken tag team for the ps is  amuch better game but it is basically the same as tekken  with enhanced graphics and doesnt have all the things that make soul calibur so much fun
i was thinking about looking for virtua fighter but then saw a review that gave soul calibur  out of  i read the review that it was like virtua fighter but with way better graphics more fighting stages and of course awesome weapons to fight with
this game has several modes in it including vs where you can play headtohead aginst a friend and arcade mode which is the best and most fun mode in this game
in arcade mode you chose one of several characters to fight with
each character has different weapons like axes swords numchucks etc
and different strengths and weaknesses
after you have succesfully beaten all  stages you will unlock a new stage to fight on or a new quotsoulquot or character to fight with that is usually much stronger than the normal characters
if you are looking for a fighting game for your dreamcast soul calibur is a musthave
and at the price of dreamcast games these days you just cant pass up the price on this great gameeven though its over a year old soul calibur is not only the bestlooking dreamcast game there is its the best d fighting game on the planet
period
nothing comes close
a lot of people say tekken tag for the ps is a better game but tag is merely a rehash of tekken  with updated graphics and dead or alive  just doesnt have the same shine
soul calibur introduced so many new ideas to the genre of d fighting that its hard to think how anyone will surpass it  the way run system and guard impact are just two of them
the graphics are flawless  fps glory the sound crystal the backgrounds enthralling
mission mode and the huge unlockable art gallery send replay value through the roof but the true treasure here is the combat system
helped by pinpoint control beginners and veterans alike will find no end to the depth of the fighting engine that the way run system opens up allowing your fighter mobility across the entire surface of the arena
people are still talking about the huge leap soul calibur represents for fighting games
namco has produced a work of art that also happens to be the most flawless game ive ever played  a year later its still the most played game on my dreamcast and im still discovering new moves and techniques
soul calibur has sold many dreamcast systems my own and all my friends as well and at the price the system and the game are now its an absolute steal
everyone whos even remotely interested in gaming owes it to themselves to experience this piece of history  games like this dont happen often folksnot that this game is old but when you consider its a game from  thats exclusive to a dead console system its amazing to realize that this game is arguably better than any other combat game out there even today
the graphics made full use of the dreamcasts capabilities and even now it is one of the most beautiful games ive ever seen
the combat moves are fluid and based on real martial artsthere is even a martial arts display mode where you can see all the characters doing various weapon katas
it is a good game for both button mashers and pros
there is no blood which makes it a bit unrealistic when you see someone getting hacked with a huge axe and not bleeding but that doesnt detract from the experience because this isnt that sort of game
the abundance of modes allows for a high replay value
the only thing i would knock is the endstories which are a bit corny and considering the animation in the gamplay itself it feels a bit like a copout to see the endings as just still life
however thats all nitpickingthis game is the reason to buy a dreamcast and it is still worth it to buy this game and then go find someone selling a dreamcast so you can buy and play it
have funthis is a really amazing game and im not even that big of a fan of fighting gamesthe graphics moves settings and so on are just incredible
ive played some d games where bad camera angles gets to be  an annoyance but this game seems really smart about that  you dont even  notice it most of the time feels very cinematica good variety of  characters each of which is very unique in style moves and controlsi  think the best thing about it is the wide variety of modes
there is a  regular arcade mode where you strive to beat computer controlled enemies  or duel with your friends
theres a practice mode where you can learn all  the cool moves for your character including lists of all the moves and  demos of how to do them and what they do
theres a mission mode where  you have to achieve various goals in the fights such as number of hits  rather than life totals decides the fight or some things are different  the one where the rats crawling around will bite the characters in the  feet and bring them down is hilarious
achieving the goals or defeating  the solo arcade version of the game can make available new characters  costumes and settings
and some other modes that i havent explored  yetthe tight outfits and realism of the graphics make  for a fair bit  of beefcakecheesecake so if you find that sort of thing offensive be  careful
its still pretty tasteful in that regard
if youre offended by  violence well this is a fighting game
although theres no gore you do  get to do things like whack your opponent a couple of times after youve  defeated them so that you can watch them writhe in agonythanks to the  practice mode even an old clumsy person like me can learn enough of the  wild moves to make it really fun
of course i still get destroyed against  people who know what theyre doing theres a lot of depth to the  blockingcountering strategies but its still a blast
im always seeing  new moves and other things that surprisehands down the greatest fighting game ever made
almost a decade after its release it still tops of even the newest fighters out there
dreamcast had the most potentioal over all the other systems to bad sega sold out
every character level skill story goes above and beyond
tops the most recent soul calibur  that was released this past july
this game should be ported exactly the way it is to nextgeneration systems with a graphic enchancementto bad many have not been able to witness the first soul calibur because it was on the dreamcastit needs to get recognized by the nexgeneration gamersit received rave reviews as essentially flawless at the time and the graphics definitely hold their own over a decade later
how many games can you say that about without being unrealistically optimistic
soul calibur for dreamcast has highly fluid game play taking the very best elements of other fighting games of the time and turning them into something beautiful
if you have a dreamcast this title is essential
with unlockable characters and story mode replay value is extremely high
if you have a gotta catch em all mentality the story mode will keep you busy for a very long time
i cannot recommend this game highly enoughthe dreamcast certainly had an abundance of fighting games
you could easily fill your shelves with capcoms fighters alone
but one title stands as not only the best game on the system but the one of the greatest games ever madesoul calibur was a launch title for the dc but you wouldnt be able to tell by the level of refinement both in asthetics and gameplayfirst the graphics are phenomenal for their day
nothing looked this good back in  on the consoles
the character models were heads and tails above anything gamers had ever saw they were clean smooth detailed featured flawless animation with fantastic effects like clothes and hair waving in the wind
the backgrounds are amazing too various settings from underground caves deteriorating castles and japanese style training groundsit also rus in progessive scan with a framerate that never falters no matter how intense battles get
not only that it looks better than the arcade version quite possibly the first game to accomplish this featsound is excellent too even today the voice work sounds great although it is in japanese so i cant understand it
sound effects are equally impressive the clash of swords and other weapons sound great nothing is overdone or repetivive
the music is wonderful its great to hear it has aged so well even after all these years
namco could have easily thown togther some bland s rock styled music but it wouldnt have done the game justice
the sweeping classical tunes work rather well with the fast paced yet tactical gameplayas far as the gameplay itself its perfectly paced not too fast not too slow
it is a game that is easy to learn hard to master
in my opinion soul calibur is the most balanced of any d fighter
even a beginner can pick up a controller understand the basic concepts of the game and have some success just feeling out the game
however its not like tekken namcos other d fighter that allows button mashers to cheat their way to victory if a person bothers to learn a characters moves he can easily devistate a beginner
there are tons of advanced moves beyond just learing a command list there are techniques such as the advanced guard and the way run to master that seperate the average player to the advanced one
combine this with strategies that a factored into most d fighters like forcing the ring out and using the clock to your advanage and you have a fighter with a serious amount of depthwhile soul caibur has tons of depth it would have not have reached a perfect score had it not taken it to the next level and by that i mean modes
that is the mistake that virtua fighter tb made
namco saw fit to make soul calibur on the dreamcast the most ambitious d fighter to date and they succeeded
they did a wonderful job of adding a fully featured versus mode team battle survival and extra survival one hit kill modes but they all pale in comparison to mission modemission mode is by far the greatest feature of soul calibur
unlike soul blade where you had a handful of character specific missions that werent very fun mission mode allows you to pick any character that you desire and progress at your own pace
missions range from winning with a ring out to survival matches and later throw in more obsure challenges
while they are challenging they are for the most part fair
as you beat each of these mode you will acquire points to buy artwork purchasing this artwork will unlock more missions costumes characters and stages
by the time you finish this mode not only will you be an accoplished swordsman but you will have a robust amount of content to show for your effortsthere is a reason soul calibur has the reputation that it doesn  years later
the game is simply stellar
it has aged rather gracefully and is the best game on the dc
the game is also available through xbox live for  but omits the mission mode and has everything already unlocked
this is truly the version to get if you want to fully experience the games as it was intended by namco
i highly reccomend this game as one of the greatest games ever madei am a huge fighting game fan but ive never liked the button mashing variety of fighting gamesuntil now
soul calibur is a fun game that keeps me coming back for more
from powerful brutes like nightmare and asteroth to fast fighters like sophitia and taki to everyone else in between this game is one of my favoritesits simple enough to pick up for anyone
 button for horizantal strikes  for vertical strikes  for kicks and  for blocking
but the strength likes in its combo system
even a newbie can get some combos by mashing buttons but someone who knows what thier doing can wipe the floor with all challengersin short best fighting game everso im sure youve played fighting games before well forget quotmortal kombatquot and quottekkenquot because quotsoul caliburquot is the new wave of fighting games
quotsoul caliburquot isnt just a fighting game it contains other great elements such as misson battles in which you are given a mission by the game to complete
and in completing the mission you are given points to unlock items in the art gallery which contains drawings and artwork from the game very interesting to look at might i add
the game also allows you to unlock new characters as well as choose another look for your character
this game is very entertaining as it breaks the rules of fighting games
because it isnt just a fighting game there is so much more you can do
there also are other modes such as quottime attackquot and quotsurvivalquot that put you against the cpu in a race for time
the background music is wonderful the graphics are ahead of their time and its great to hear the characters speak in japanese
again this is a superb game this is worth owning a dreamcast forsoul calibur is the classic version of the arcade game and is only available on the dreamcast
for many its the main reason to buy a dreamcastyou get a nice selection of characters both male and female young and old
if theres a complaint about the characters its that the females tend to have very skimpy outfits that mostly show off jiggly breasts and lots of underwear
the guys tend to have fully covered bodies
somethings not quite even herethere are a number of modes between simple arcade mode one on one combat training demos and more
as you play through the game you earn points which let you unlock more secrets
it encourages you to go through the game as each character learning their best moves and techniques
each character has his or her own favorite weapons and combat styleas with all fighting games you have to get used to the violence
the characters are bashing each other with some rather nasty moves  and it doesnt necessarily stop when one person is defeated
ive seen my character kicked to the ground the game announce my defeat and then the enemy throw in a final gratuitous kick
its very discouragingthe different levels are fun with their atmosphere and backgrounds
the music is on the generic side and doesnt go themed with the world youre in as more modern fighters tend to do
also it is sometimes fairly easy to simply knock your opponent out of the ring and be done with italso on the sounds angle there are only a limited number of things that the announcer says
so if you play a given character through an  round series of fights you are going to hear the same thing over and over againthat all being said this is a true classic of a game and many people have become quite fond of the sequels
so if youre into inexpensive fighters or if youre a soul calibur fan who wants to see where it all began this is a must havesoul calibur is one of the best games that i have ever played on any game console
mitsurugi is my favorite character but there are several characters that i like in the game
the graphics are very impressive second only to dead or alive  as far as fighting games are concerned
but what makes this game one of the best fighting games on any system is that it is the most sophisticated fighting game that is out now
you have arcade team battle time attack survival extra survival practice mission battle mode exhibition mode battle theater mode art gallery mode profile mode several different extra characters and tons of other stuff
the mission battle mode along has several different ways to play the game which will add interest to playing the game for a very long time
first you have to earn most of the secrets in the game by beating the mission battle mode and then after you beat itvery long and challenging you can still play it again
anybody that has a dreamcast and likes fighting games should definitely get this gamehandsdown this is the best fighting game that i have ever played
the fighting system is deep and complex but doesnt have the huge learning curve that tekken does
i have heard people call battles played by expert players to be like a dance with blocking parrying dodging and a variety of attacks used to keep your opponent guessing
a good selection of characters are available though some are just mirrors of other characters with a few different moves
there is also a practice mode that helps you to learn button combinations for the  moves for each characterpretty standard nowadays but soul calibur was one of the first to do this to my knowledge
the soundtrack is excellent the gameplay is excellent and its just an overall awesome game
back before the psgamecubexbox came out this was the reason you bought a dreamcast
if you dont own those  systems and cant get soul calibur  get the original
its very much worth itsoul caliber  circa good goodtight controls nicely balanced gameplay lots of different and unique fighters minutes to learn years to master gameplay some nice unlockables like new fighters costumes stages and other bonuses a d fighting game that really uses the d space with eight way run considered a classic to many hardcore fighting fanaticsbad non traditional fighting gameplay might alienate some more traditional fighting game fans have to unlock most of the game through the storyquest modeif it fits your taste has medieval theme both european and chinesejapanese not traditional fighting game in the sense that there is no real combos and supers or even projectile moves game has built in quest mode where you pick a fighter and complete a number of challenges the end result is you unlock more content and are a better player fight with weapons like a d samurai showdowngame its most assocated too soul caliber  tekken  samurai showdownadditional notes you can unlock a mode that lets you customize your intro by picking who will be in the intro of the game at which pointsby far one of the greatest games i have ever played
great story mindblowing graphics awesome characters and more
everything about this game is incredible right down to the realistic breathing motions of the characters
the soundtrack is the best i have heard out of any fighting game to date
i am desperately trying to find it but i still cant
let me know if you do
lots of game modes and jampacked with secrets
it will take you a long time to get bored with this game
this is the only reason i havent sold my dc yet since sega abandoned itthis is without a doubt the best game for the dreamcast
if you own this game and you have friends or family for competition around to compete with then you know exactly what i am talking aboutclassic fighting game
namco did something right here
they created a perfect fighting game
this was an arcade but didnt get any attention like the great teken seriesthis game looks just like the arcade if not better
sega really came though
i have a dreamcast and only  games
this is one of them
this came is the main reason i purchased the dreamcast almost  years agothe characters are the best i have ever seen
with ease they blow away simple characters like sub zero ryu or paul from other fighting gamesthe weapon advancement to each figher is pretty brillant also
the sound for this classic is nice tooeach character has his or her own stage
the stages are mindblowing
dont just take my word for it rent the game and waste  or  dollars becaues after you play it you are going out to your local best buy to get this gameits that good
give credit where credit is due
thanks namco for making the perfect fighting gamewhen namco introduced pole position they revolutionized gaming forever
when namco introduced dig dug they revolutionized gaming forever
when namco introduced pacman they revolutionized gaming forever
when namco introduced soul caliburyou know the restthe unanimous vote for best fighting game ever made was given to this game
soul calibur is indeed the best fighting game ever made
with seemingly endless quotgoodiesquot intense battles beautiful artwork incredible graphics namco has once again revolutionized gaming forever surprise
with nineteen playable characters i think this game never endsthere is a mission battle mode in which you fight battles to earn points which in turn will buy cards with artwork on them
some cards unlock costumes some unlock whole levels
a few unlock whole new modes
thats all i have to say about this except for buy this gameone of the first games ever released for the dreamcast and one of the best soul calibur is amazing from start to finish
the graphics control special features and fighting engine are superb and this is the one game that if you own a dreamcast you must have this as well
however good luck finding it when the dreamcast came out it sold pretty quickly and namco only released the game in limited quanitites but this is one hell of a game and its a better investment to buy a dreamcast and this game rather than lay down  bucks for a single game on any of the other systemsnamco has set a new standard of graphics and gameplay for the fighting game genre with soul calibur
this game surpasses every d fighting game in a number of categories
fresh characters responsive and balanced gameplay incredible graphics jaw dropping animation lots of replay value and even great music can be found in soul calibur
not only is this a perfect arcade conversion it actually has even better and more polished graphics than the arcade game
if you have a dreamcast and are a fan of fighting games your collection is not complete without soul calibur
play it for yourself and find out why
hopefully namco will take their time with the sequel because its going to take alot of effort to make a fighting game better than thisfirst of all this game has awesome graphics nothing on any other systemcomputer compares to them
the game is fun with a bunch of  characters and several that are unlockable plus a mission mode where you  have certain goals with story elements that comply with the story of the  game playing through the mission mode you earn points so you can spend  them to view artwork viewing the art can unlock new options arenas etc
buy itim make this short and sweet
this is the greatest fighting game ever
and this is a dc exclusive and will forever be one of the best dc games ever
it has everything i love about fighting games
first off the visuals are just so juicy
not as sharp as sc but still great visuals even for this time of the year
the game has some really great things added to this dc version such as a mission mode its like a story mode what you do is buy art galleries to start new mission trust me itll keep you in for weeks especially since its for every character
the game has some other neat things added to this game such aspracticemodemission modesurvival modearcade mode which you can unlock charactersand some other neat things but i will tell you right now if you do have a dreamcast dont keep it to dust and play gta on your ps
you need this game for the dreamcast
this is one of the reasons people got a dreamcasti got it as a gift from my aunt and took advantage of it by getting the gamesand this gem was one of them
listendo your self a favor and get this gameheck even gamespot gave this game  and its extreamly hard getting a good score on this game  the visuals arnt as great as sc and that is pretty much the only thing wrong with it  bottom linegoodsuperb visuals on the dcgreat extras for the dc versionmission mode rockscontrolls are easy to get use toloads of play time and arcade mode is a blastbadhmmmnothinguglynothinggreatest fighting game ever only on the dreamcasti give it a  out of  stars
latesthe only draw back with this game is it gets kind of boring but its a great game that put bypassed the arcade by far
this is a game i wont forgetsoulcalibur is the best game on the sega dreamcast its as simple as that
i cant even explain in words what this game has to offer
i had never been a huge fan of fighting games but when i played this the tables turned
this game has the most depth and detailed graphics of any ive ever seen by far
it has probably the most beautiful backgrounds ever perfect gameplay an astounding soundtrack fast weaponclinging action just to name a few
thats not even mentioning all the game modes and the exquisite art gallery
the character detail and design is so colorful real artistic and smooth itll blow your mind
this game is the mother of all fighting games blowing any tekken especially tag tournament into the ground
tekken would be good if you could move faster than a turtle
plus its some really good epic scenes of each character and each character is unique in both multiple costumes and weapon use
their names are even awesome their outfits moves fast action combos etc
this game is just too much to talk about you have to see this for yourself
fighting has never been better
if i owned sega the dreamcast would come with this game at a minimum
this is a must own title for this system its incomplete without it
buy it todayin  namco released a game called soul blaade in north america known as soul edge in japan and it was a game that focused on weapons based combat and centered on several characters going after a sword called soul edge
either to destroy it or attain it for their own means
when namco began talking about a sequel one of the first things they knew they wanted to incorporate was the use of the entire arena instead of just characters moving on one line
this eventually lead the creation of  way run
where one couldliterallywalk circles around their opponent
but was it right to simply call it soul blade 
project soul thought not
instead they called their new creative and innovative fighter soul caliburthough not having a fantastic run in arcades the game was ported to the dreamcast in  and launched with the system
when it was released it was such a smashing success and offered so much for players that we had a new champion of fighters
it was simple enough for newcomers but had enough depth for experts
but more than that  way run and the detail the game had was at the time just unheard of
looking at it now its hard to believe the game was originally made in   it was not only well ahead of its time but the only game that really seemed to give it any competition was the release of soul calibur ii years later
since its release the original soul calibur has gone on to be recognized as one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made
and to this day the only game that is really like soul calibur are the other soul calibur gamesmany fighting games are not much for their stories
a lot of them can tell a story but theyre primarily about the fighting
the original soul calibur is the same way but there is actually an emphasis on characters and the relationships that these characters feel they have with other characters
every character has their own unique ending to arcade mode and every character has a biography that you can read to learn about them
theres definitely a story and a narrative at work here
as you read about the characters youll learn as to why each of them are going after soul edge
their stories are tragic but interesting
its even more fun for those who played the original soul blade
things hadnt become quite convoluted with the story yet
and when you read about all these characters some of them youre bound to find intriguing in their own way
you may even find yourself having a favorite
not just because of how they fight but because of who they are as a person
theyve got personality here and it shows not only in their exchanges in combat their endings in arcade and their biographies but also in just how well they fightsoul calibur has a simple way of fighting
youve got horizontal vertical and kick attacks
you can also guard and of course move all around the ring
you can also combine attacks by pressing two buttons simultaneously for different attacks
the implimentation of  way run really increases the number of moves which can be done
its simple to pick up soul calibur but the game itself is fairly difficult to master
unlike other games there is actually qutie an emphasis on pokes precise strikes and quick moves rather than emphasising the need to learn tons of special moves and combos
it certainly doesnt hurt to learn these things but no one will feel powerless when playing soul calibur
but it does have a few complex moves and combos none the less
some characters have slide input movements while others may have attacks that require much more precise timing
anyone can pick up the game and utilize pokes but a true master will actually have to sit down and train with some of their favorite charactersits also to no surprise that soul calibur does put a huge emphasis on the players ability to move all over the arena instead of just in a straight line where they my have moves that step to the side
this is emphasized by the fact that any character can also attack while circling another
or they can use this to side step opponents
this wasnt just some gimmick thrown in this was pretty much what soul calibur was all about
to put more emphasis on this soul calibur allows players to knock one another out of the ring
if there was anything that stood out in soul calibur as a real flaw it might be this little tidbit
unlike future games in the series the first game made knocking someone out of the ring a fairly simple thing to do
characters went out of the ring far more easily than otherwise
and while its great to snatch a victory through ring out it can be a pain when you suffered a ring out just because a very small portion went over the ringaside from that soul calibur was a nearly flawless game
it managed to do this by offering players what the arcade couldnt
before soul calibur came out in  if you wanted the best graphics and best experience with fighting games you typically went to arcade to have it
soul calibur was one of the games that helped to change this in part because of the dreamcast
the dreamcast version of the game looked and sounded better than the arcade version
the stages were more detailed
the backgrounds rather than being prerendered were actually in d
the game was the prettiest thing on the market in   and the characters were also detailed
the console version of the game also offered different modes
you had the typical arcade mode but the game also gave you a survival mode and things to keep you busy such as the games mission mode
where you went to various stages to partake in missions
these missions earned you points which you could exchange in the art gallery
sometimes when you bought art in the gallery you unlocked other missions stages or character exhibition theaters
there was a lot to unlock in soul calibur
it was an experience you simply couldnt have in the arcadeas a result soul calibur has also managed to age well in part because it was so far ahead of its time
in fact its sequels can only seem to do worse because aside from tweaking characters and adding moves there isnt really much you can do to improve the experience of soul calibur
a franchise that achieves this much critical and commercial success right out of the gate doesnt really have anywhere to go but down
and indeed the soul calibur series has often been criticized that not much has been done to the basic formula as the years have gone by
but when you play the first game it becomes apparent that its really hard to build on that particular foundation
were talking about a game that was hailed by critics and consumers as one of the greatest games of all time when it first dropped onto the dreamcast in  and is one of the few games on amazon that still retains a five star rating years later
where exactly do you go from greatest exactly
no where really
but it seems to be a testament as to how powerful and impactful soul calibur really ended up being
the original still manages to be a strong game even by todays standardsthe soul continues to burn bright and those who still have their dreamcast should own this game
it is not just one of the best games you can find on the system but still remains as one of the greatest games ever madeforget any other reason for buying a dreamcast  soul calibur remains as the sole good reason for spending the money
its worth the money its worth the money and its worth your time to check it out
you may have some trouble grabbing a copy of soul calibur because every dreamcast owner probably purchased this at the counter when picking up their system
soul calibur is the ultimate in fighting games  sleek graphically unparalleled and deep  and ranks as the best fighting game out there
its set apart from its competitors by the double knockout of a great look and solid game play
based on last years hit arcade game and a sequel to the smash playstation hit soul blade soul calibur pits ten fighters against each other in a standard twooutof three battle for supremacy
but might doesnt always make for right in this game
soul calibur is unprecedented in its game balance with large impressive bulky fighters on the same ground as small fast players
the ten starting fighters are just that  a starting lineup
through game play and advancement youll uncover many cameo fighters like yoshimitsu from tekken and seung mina and hwang from soul blade
there are also mystery stages and costume changes to uncover
soul calibur also offers many new options that the arcade version couldnt
battle mode team battle and survival modes all lend the game an enormous replay value while the sometimes complicated move system is helped out by a very thorough practice mode that explains every move and shows you how to execute them
graphically the game evolves past its arcade counterpart in every respect with incredible detail and superior polygon counts
soul calibur on the dreamcast is without a doubt the best looking fighting game ever with nuances like muscle rippling facial expressions of pain fear and anger and caustic lighting effects that dazzle the eyes
the game also excels in the area of sound achieving what other games only dream of  the perfect balance of music voice and sound effects
clashing swords primal yelling and bloodpumping heroic themes course through the game all meshing for the perfect sonic mix
namco has retooled the fighting dynamics so that both buttonmashers and serious students of asswhupping can both benefit and prosper in the game
although novices can easily beat the game on easier settings the game definitely favors those who understand soul caliburs complexities like dodging vertical and way run attacks and stagger blocking
someone who has mastered the arcade game will find the differences in the moves trifling while every one else will scarcely notice
what are you waiting for
sonic can wait trickstyle will still be pulling tricks next week and nfl k has a millenium ahead of it
theres no excuse for you not to be enjoying the best fighting game this year and possibly the best ever
power stone and the laughable mortal kombat gold cant touch the soul of this fighter but you canone of the best fighters ever made actually quite possible the best fighter ever made thus far
graphics far superior to tekken or dead or alive  this game rocks
there is so much to do you unlock all kinds of good stuff by fighting like galleries of art new costumes and levels to fight on and more
this game has great strategy in it as well as it is not like marvel vs capcom where you just push buttons and pull off random power moves
this game is exceptional and i own it since the dreamcast debuti grew up playing mortal kombat
i was a fan of the series up to its d debut when it really began spiraling downhill
soul calibur is the first d fighter that i felt is worth the buy
it has a deep storyline as deep as fighting games get
it includes tons of secrets that can be accessed by playing through the games on various modes
the graphics are the best you can find on any system
buy the game if you even remotely like fighting games
if you dont what is wrong with youyou cant beat the classics nes snes and now even n is considered classic
mario golf will be fun for the rest of my life
the game itself is in great condition and i will be playing this one frequentlywhen i first played this game i knew next to nothing about the sport of golf
i rented it for three days not only learning how to play golf but  quickly becoming horribly addicted to ita month later i now own this  fabulous game and i also play golf too although my real game needs some  work mario golf doesnt
its fun challenging experience that everyone  can enjoy
bring over your three friends and play all night its the best  golf game ever madeawesome golf game for the n if you are an old nintendo freak add this one to your collection it provides hours of funthe golfing is nice and smooth in this game and also there is lots of playable charactersthe golf courses look very good and just about everything in the game has nice things to offerany n owner should defintely check this game outi was the biggest fan of nes open one of the last games made for the original nintendo entertainment system
it was a golf game that featured betting longest drive contests and a tournament where you could name all your competitors
most golf games ive played focused more on having a big name ie
tiger woods than fun
but nes open was great fun and i thought itd never be beat
im eating my words
mario golf is one of the most fun games period
so many optionsyou can play the tournament ring shot speed golf play characters and keep them mini golf skins and more
the suspense of the match game is the best
its going to take me forever to achieve everything on this game
the only complaint is that the minigolf is really uncreative
other than thatits perfectlove this game
play it nonstop and might just be readdicted to it
works great and have had no problems with itive played this game extensively and it really is my favorite golf game
i even prefer it to the more realistic games out there
it  has perfect control fun and varied courses nintendo characters and four people can play at a time
its just plain funreally fun game for a group of people
easy to learn how to play
good variety of courses
i would recommend this game to anyonei was skeptical when i first rented this video game
i never thought that anything related to golf could be interesting and ironically i ended up buying this game a day later and playing it for hours and hours hopelessly addicted to it
mario golf has many different playing modes to entertain you  tournament challenging tournaments where you compete for the gold cup play for a character mode to unlock another character and many various speed trials
the characters are the classic mario luigi peach toad bowser wario etc plus a many more new characters kids snobby golf experts slick pros
this game is challenging but not too hard dont worry no golf knowledge is required
so basically what i am saying is that this game is excellent dont hesitate to try it outi love n games and this is one of the most fun ones i have
love the fact i came play as different characters
fun for all agesif you have any interest in video golf whatsoever you need to get this game
nintendo has succeeded in making a golf game that is fun and challenging for young and grownup people alikethere are several different types of play in the game
you can play by yourself in tournament mode in headtohead mode against the computer or other golfers in ring mode speed mode or in minigolftournament mode is the big one  you start with a variety of nintendo characters to choose from and one course to play on
completing rounds earns you experience points which are used to unlock other courses and characters
you also get trophies for finishing in the top three and birdie badges for getting a birdie or better on a hole
as with similar games your goal is to unlock all courses and characters and collect all the badgesheadtohead mode provides another method of unlocking characters
beating a character in match play enables you to use it in the other modes
the game also saves your records with each character against all the others
the best play with this mode though is against other players
you can set handicaps bet on each hole the front nine back nine closest to pin longest drive and you can even play slotmachine golf where each player gets only a random wood long iron and short iron for each hole  if youre lucky and get three stars you get the full complement but if you only get one star you get one fewer club
try playing a par hole with your longest club being a ironthe ringshot mode is challenging as well  you must hit your ball through one or more rings on the course and finish the hole in par or better
clearing rings will unlock characters as well
if you think the first few tasks are easy they will get tougher as you advance
characterbycharacter progress is saved for this as wellspeed golf is interesting  your fastest times on each course are saved along with your corresponding scores  but not quite as much fine
mini golf is included as well but without any rewards i noticedif you think this is a good game so far wait till you play the game boy version as well
you can use the transfer pak sold separately for some reason to move your game boy character to the n version where you can use your experience to build your character
this is essential for mastering the harder courses and beating the top golfers  your gbc character can become stronger than wario and hit the ball straighter as well
you can also pit your characters against your friends characters or trade them if youre so inclined
finally you can send your n status back to your gbc and view it in more detail there  you can see each characters best score on each courseeven without the gbc version this is a topflight golf game in its own light
add the game boy color version and a transfer pak and you have a keeperi love what i got and i dont worry about it not having a case as cases waste space
thank youit is a fun game to revisit after several years but it does get old quickly with having to memorize moves and limited wrestling moves you have access to
it is still an enjoyable game for a few weeksi get it its features are lame but for me this game is cool
it was fun to wrestle with even though there were times where the wrestler would run and stay running and never move again or when you would lift up a wrestler to perform a finisher and they would stay dazed for like a few minutes corny moments but still goodi enjoy seeing the ppv smackdown and raw
this one is a rare one to get if you like wwe wrestlingresident evil  nemesis is the third game in the series though it was not intended to be that was supposed to be code veronica but whatever and it is the third best
and that is nothing to be ashamed ofthis game had a lot to live up to coming on the heels of what is arguably the best game for the entire playstation system resident evil does it
yes and no
it is an amazing game
jill is hot
the graphics are nice the music is great and nemesis is awesome
the only thing this game had going against it was the length felt a bit rushed
theres not quite as much substance here as in resident evil  and but capcom has made up for that with the live decisions that alter gameplay and even endings and the randomness of the game in terms of enemies and items
you never know quite what youll get on any given play throughbottom line get this game only after getting the first  in the series but please get it
it is much better than capcoms lackluster effort at modern resident evil gamesthis game still has soulthis is another great re
game with a cool mercenaries game at the endthis i got for my son who loves it more than i can say resident evil  nemesis is sometimes called the forgotten installment in the resident evil series
other people just call it the least popular
lets face it all the attention went to resident evil  and  because those were the games that were revolutionary
those were the games that not only brought realistic neverbeforeseen gameplay and d survival horror graphics to the original playstation but the resident evil series also made it very difficult for any imitators to come along and try to overtake the popularity and success of the resident evil series
capcom knew they had something amazing with this series and thats why when video game fans think about being scared and trying to stay alive the resident evil series immediately comes to mindnow here comes resident evil  nemesis
correct me if im wrong but at the time of its release this game didnt receive nearly as much attention as the previous two resident evil games
maybe it had something to do with the fact that video game fans were anticipating the upcoming release of the playstation  in the year  or maybe people thought the resident evil series was starting to run dry
nah i highly doubt that second one is true
nemesis was just the resident evil game that didnt really stand out despite the many positive reviews of the game that im sure youve read about
yes the game is fantastic and the fact that so many people would agree with me is more proof that the resident evil series was nowhere near ready to be forgotten
not in this lifetime baby
its just that nemesis wasnt really a drastic jump forward in terms of innovation like resident evil  wasi honestly believe if you have an appetite for running around destroying zombies that nemesis is the perfect resident evil game for you
i was completely taken by surprise as i continued to progress through the game and notice that the amount of zombies and other familiar enemies are absolutely loaded almost everywhere you go
zombies left and rightat the very beginning of the game when i looked inside that giant item box beside the typewriter i couldnt believe capcom was so generous as to give me more than enough ammo right from the beginning
i really mean it you receive a lot of ammo from your item box
after beating the game i had a ton of ammo leftover
now i realize people will probably look at this as a bad thing and complain that lots of ammo greatly decreases the challenge and makes progressing through the game a cakewalk
theyd also have a point if they wanted to complain that giving you loads of easilyavailable ammo straight from your item box doesnt really define strategy game since you arent spending the majority of your time dodging enemies you can simply walk up to them and shoot them and have more than enough ammo available for the next enemy you encounter
theyd be absolutely correct on both countscapcom is also pretty generous when it comes to those green herbs and first aid sprays
you can find plenty of them throughout the game just sitting around on the table or floor making the challenge level go down even more
oh and lets not forget that in addition to having lots and lots of ammo generously offered to you you also receive a few awesome weapons such as a machine gun and a shotgun straight from the beginning of the game
another thing when you pick up for example handgun bullets you actually receive a lot of ammo
i believe in resident evil  each of those orange packs of ammo contained about  bullets
in this game you receive and im honestly not kidding around  bullets per pack
capcom made running out of ammo something you will never have to worry abouthowever in a few ways the challenge has been increased from resident evil   for example remember how slow the zombies would walk up to you in resident evil 
you could practically stand next to them and blast away and not have to worry about taking any hits
in nemesis however zombies are almost running at you forcing you to turn around and allow yourself room to shoot
this is awesome because you wont know which zombies are slow pokes and which ones are speed runners until you see one on screen
oh and thankfully a quick turnaround button has been included
press down on the directional pad  the run button to turn right around
very convenient buttonthis game is also much scarier not to mention much bloodier than the previous resident evil game
the last time around only sometimes zombies would break a window and try to attack you along with crows dogs and other dangerous enemies
in nemesis not only do windows break all the time but zombies can pop out of cars jump down from buildings and other incredible things
many times you will be caught completely off guard when it happens too
this is awesomei love the fact that you actually go back to the police station from the previous resident evil game for a short while
you go back grab some things and then head back out to the streets again where most of the game takes place
interesting how the music from the main hall of the police station has remained exactly the same and its also interesting when you notice certain places blocked off that were very important to access in the previous game with claire and leon as your playable charactersyoure probably wondering why the game is called nemesis
well nemesis is the name of an enormous persistent and dangerous maniac that throughout the game constantly tries to attack you
he can either smack you with his arm or shoot rockets at you
this doesnt make the game as hard as you probably think because most of the time you can simply run away from him
however when he appears get ready to either fight or run away
dont stand around too long
decide quicklyi want to set the record straight about something
people writing reviews for this game will probably tell you that nemesis chases you around from the beginning to the end of the game
thats not exactly true
yes its true he will be a problem for you until the very last level but you should know that nemesis does not follow you around for the entirety of the game he just appears sometimes messes with you by following you into rooms and whatnot and then he disappears for a while
if you havent played this game yet some reviewers will have you convinced that nemesis will be chasing you around all the time nonstop and this is not trueprobably the biggest challenge comes in the way of puzzlesolving
now think back to resident evil   what did you have
you had three or four puzzles to solve
and they were easy
in nemesis lets see you have  puzzles to solve and some of them simply cant be completed unless youre either a really excellent puzzle solver or you look the answers up on the internetyes im talking about that famous dreaded water puzzle near the end of the game
honestly the best way to successfully finish the darn puzzle is to just look up all the possible solutions on the internet and then write them down
i found seven different answers so far
dont feel ashamed for having to look up the answers
this is one of those rare nearlypossible puzzles that you shouldnt feel bad about for not being able to understand it
dont get me wrong once you find out how to do the puzzle its easy
but if you happen to be mostly familiar with resident evil  and think you can go through the game on your own without a walkthrough looking up help will probably be the best idea when you finally arrive to this puzzle
youll be glad when its finishedthe game has a good storyline too well by video game standards anyway with excellent actionpacked cutscenes located throughout the game
if you consider yourself an actiontype person you will enjoy some of these cutscenes a lot
i guarantee it
one of them has something to do with a helicopter and youll love watching italso resident evil  includes an infinite amount of ink ribbons to save your progress and you now also have an option to skip over dialogue conversations and cutscenes by pressing the select button
you didnt have this in the last gameoverall i give this game the highest possible score you can give and that would be  stars
it truly deserves it
the fact that you have to face about twice as many zombies this time around and the fact that you are basically outside roaming the streets the entire time are major major highlights for the game
these streets are deadly
pick up this game today and have funfor any resident evil players out there if you played and resident evil and resident evil  for the playstation version then youll like itthis game is awesome
the plot is intriguing the characters are realistic and it has some references to re
it posesses some of the problems that the other re games had the controls still bite and the inventory system is pretty difficult to deal with at times how does a key take up as much space as a shotgun
but you get used to the controls and you just have to deal with the inventory
a nifty new edition is the ability to make new and stronger ammo by creating various combinations of gunpowders
you also become faced with situations where you have to decide what to do and your decision alters the course of the game and in one case which ending you see
which was not seen in the first   you are also stalked by one of the coolest looking monsters ever the nemesis
temporarily knocking this beast out can yield rewards that can make your life quite a bit easier but be warned it is no easy task
make sure that you are at least familiar with the plot of re before you play this re never really comes up
very fun and challengingso far ive played   and  and this is probably my favoritegameplay this time you are jill from the original
lots of areas like the city police station hospital park clock tower its a big game
you also have a dodge move
and the stalker zombie nemesis makes the game shine hes fun to fight
you also sometimes make choices on events
and a new mercanaries mode adds to the funmusic your standard horror tunes
gotta love nemmys themesound decent voices this time and cool soundoverall if you are looking for a top notch horror game you gotta get thisthis game is very ominous and scary
i love the capabilities the characters have and the scenery is spooky
it was one of the last psone games so the graphics are advanced for that platform
you can definately see the improvements between resident evil and resident evil  nemesis
i love playing this on my ps and im not even getting the gamecube version of it because its exactly the same as this versionthis was the third and one of the hardest installement in the series
esepcially on hard mode
here are some tips on how to beat this game on hard mode based of a speed run release early this year or late last year
try to put on infinite help
if seeing how fast you can do this get the shotgun as soon as powerful and use it at close range when neccessary when fighting multiple normal enemies
when attacked by nemissi run  away as fast as you can since he is programm to eliminate all sureviving mebers of star a millitray defense force created to expose the illegal umbrela corporetations experiment
the main character is injected with a virus but do to a cermun called thew t cell whgich delays the zombie fication program she still has control over here self
get the shooty gun
at the end of the game you can hurt nemesis and after turning the power of in the final before the city is nuked of the map you have a choice of finishing nemsis of permantely if you have cheats one or can hit him fromn a distance with the shoot guns or the freeze gas and other weapons that you can find or unlock or if you have enough herbs to restore your health before you die
running more will get you through the game faster and quicker which you want on hard mode if you dont have life super armoor or infinte shotgun shells or something like that
they dont mention nemsis  orgin as clear parts of this game were partly based on the second  movie resident evil reserection
nemesis does not turn on the scientist that experiment on him at the last minute allow jill a few second head start before the helicopter is shoot down and explodes in the movie but she survives
if you ernjoy this try the super hard resiodent evil four or the diono cris gamesthis game is extream fun and entertainment let alone being an awesome game itself
i felt once again like i was taking part in an adrenaline pumping movie once again only this time with more killing than ever before
to write this review i will split the game into three sections what was good what was bad and what made me really love this gamenow i will list the goodies
well to start off just look at it if you notice the graphics are crisp and insanely detailed
if that werent good enough the cinematics are also incredibly intense and clear and they tell the story rather well
whats good about the cinematics however is that they are very well directed and carry the mood perfectly
the mood of this game is magnificant its like a blend of fear anger and depression all at once
the music supports these emotions which is esspecially good when they focus on a single emotion
also the sound is great another advancement over the sounds of the previous entry
i loved the voice acting and the new clicking sounds to the guns as opposed to the old popping sounds of gunplay
the gameplay is almost perfect as now you can autoaim at the zombies but not make it superfake looking like it was in the originalthe plot though like re is the backbone of the game
the characters in this game are well done and all play roles in the story
the story constantly increases the intensity as you are pitched up against bigger and badder dudes esspecially nemesis
the opening was awesome and this game has one of the most emotional endings i have seen for the psx not quite final fantasy levelhowever there are setbacks to this awesome game as i will now mention
i will have to state that the storyline wasnt as gripping as in re nor as complicated with multiple scenarios
the cinematics while the finest i have ever seen are very short in length so their overall effect isnt as high as i could have hoped
also after beating the game so many times this game is now to me very easy for i know nemesis weaknesses and can easily exploit them email me for free tips
also the music isnt for the most part as good or scary or sad as in re
however some of the tunes at the very end are absolutely astounding and alone are worth purchasing the soundtrack well i did just for those three tracksnow i will tell you my favorite aspect of this game my reason for giving it a five star rating without any hesitation
the reason is that it satisfies my male cravings to kill and win
nemesis follows you around so much that instead of getting annoyed you get   he constantly lowers your overall ammo amount and forces you to use up healing items
as you fight him you lust nothing more than to give nemesis as much pain as you can give to him you want him to die a horrible death
in all the times you fight him he passes out when you win and thats the end
then the second to last time you fight him you can use acid faucets to melt parts of him away
you can take off his arms and even his head
and the last time you fight him you set up the puzzle and while you wait you can unleash whatever firepower you want on him theres no passing out and allowing your escape the last battle is a battle of revenge
i loved that and i think any player who likes thrilling and fun games would love this game toothis one is set during the time when claire and leon are surviving the night in raccoon city now jill valentine resigns from stars
and has to survive the city to try to escape but there are dangers waiting for her while she tries to escape such as zombies mutants and a brand new foe called  nemesis she joins up with a renegade and his crew on trying to survive her latest nightmaremost excellent third entry using tons of action you can control puzzles to solve and ways to survive
this is also very scary not for those who are light sleepers but a must playi did have this game before and since i couldnt get through a certain maze i sold it along with other games to get the new ps  at the time in which was only the box version
i wish i never did sell it because now one you play resident evil    your almost prompted to play the rest of the games of this serieslet me just say that i have been a big fan of the series since the first one arrived on the playstation and this one does not disappoint
the game play is one of the most important parts in any game and this one is no exception and excels from the previous releases and adds new improvements to keep the game play from getting repetitive
the storyline is pretty good too but is mainly to expand the story of the events of resident evil  though there is a side story so to speak of jill trying to escape the current situation that she is in which is also a welcome edition
the graphics are some of the best seen on the playstation and the best out of any of the four resident evil game releases on the ps the sound is also good too
this is the first re game that never made it to the playstation greatest hits lineup but dont let that fool you because it is still a great game and a worthy edition to the series
i have only one minor complaint though the game is a little shorter than re in which i would have enjoyed the game more if it was longer even though it is short it is also sweet
for anyone who cant understand or is confused with the storyline ill explain the commandosone of many groups of rescue teams sent by umbrella were there officially to rescue survivors unofficially though the leader was there to keep umbrella up to date of the current situation in raccoon city and collect battle data specifically from the nemesis fighting the remaining stars members
nemesis was basically an improved version of the tyrant type  that was in resident evil  in which the first tyrant originated from resident evil  at this point in the game umbrella knew the current situation that was occurring in raccoon city via the leader of the commandos so the only option to cover up the incident in order to remain in business was to kill the remaining stars members who held the only evidence linking this outbreak to umbrella so they sent nemesisan improved version of the tyrant andor tyrant type  to assassinate the remaining stars members thus destroying any evidence linking umbrella to the incident happening in raccoon city
unbeknown to umbrella chris had already escaped before the outbreak occurredas explained in re  when claire was surprised to not find chris in raccoon city so if chris had any chance to take down umbrella he would have to not tell anyone when where or what he was going to do at that time
eventually all of the main stars membersbarry chris jill that escaped the mansion incident escaped raccoon city before it was destroyed
eventually the remaining stars members exposed umbrella putting them out of business though people like wesker still exist to continue the work of umbrella for his own nefarious purpose
i am not really impressed with re  or from what i have played of re so far because they are just not as good as the re series used to be this game on the other hand is a testament to the fact that you can still make vast improvements in the re series without sacrificing what made the re series so great in the first place
sadly though i hardly recognize the re series today it just went downhill since re was released because changes that were made negatively affected more than benefited the series imo
i just hope that capcom wakes up and brings the old school style resident evil flavor with improvements like re re and recvx did for the series in the future for the serieswhat is this monster who runs faster than zombies and carries some times rocket like weapon and say stars all the time it is nemesis a powerful mutant now jill is back and you will meet new peoples such as carlos
the nicole is the bad guy if you want to kill him than in dead factory in the begin you will two live section likepush him offjump offif want wish nicole die than select push him off because nemesis will kill himso horror game in the series of resident evilincluding new hidous mutants a mrtouhg guy nemesismatt the new movie of resident evil is the nemesis which is after stars members
he is not after jill he is after us because we are take control of jill
more horror than resident evil but no speaical features
but dont turn your volume off because will say stars and you will konw that he is after youi bought this game  weeks after it came outand was i impressedthe game had great features like bringing jill valentine back the re gamesthis had good monsters like the zombiesdogslikers and nemisisthe only thing i did not like was how nemisis kept stalking you  seven but other than that this was a very good gamethis game is if im right the last jill valentine adventure which makes me mad but this game is excellent
ive beaten it  times and still like it
you get to kill infected zombies use cool weapons and lots of other neat junk
and when you beat the game you get a game called mercenaries
and you get a key for new dresses
the goal in the game is to kill nemeses who is a guenie pig infected with the gvirus not t the t virus is the one that makes people zombies
you will team up with  of umbrellas biohazard forces mercenaries and kill everything and risk everything to escape raccoon city
but on the way one of your umbrella buddies admits he is a supervisor and trys to escape alone betraying you and your friends
but he dies and so does someone else
this game is so much fun but you have to find everything on your own you cant just goto a shop and ask for ammo cause everyone workin there are zombies
youll love this game i just know yall willthis game kept me on the edge of my seat for days
i highly recommend
gameplay is awesome graphics are perfect and the bonus game at the end of the main game is worth playing through the whole thing more than oncefirst let me get something off here
resident evil  was the best but that doesnt mean to not get this one too because this is an incredible game very fun lasts long enough to keep you entertained from begining to end 
and then when you beat it you will unlock the mercenarieswhere you can unlock unlimited ammo for your guns and i think you can unlock infinite health too
making the game like a movie invinsible characters and they will never run out of ammo
the reason this game is not as good as resident evil  is that it doesnt have enough bosses or big enemies even though you do fight nemesis a lot and always wondor will he stay dead this time or do i gotta kill him again
its still better to have more bossesresident evil is one of the longest run playstation titles out there
it is really a shame that gamecube is the exclusive re platform now because playstation always did it best
since th very birth of ps there has been resident evil and re  does not dissapoint
re  puts a great new spin on the series through the arch super villan nemesis
nemesis as you can see from the box art is a menacing tyrant much like the tyrants in re  out for the lead character jills blood
the great part about this game is the difficulty setting
while they really make no difference it can give the new gamers to this title a bit more edge since this is one of the harder re titlesthe thing that makes this game so adicttive to survival horror junkies like myself is the claustrophobic action throughout the game you have the idea in the back of your head that nemesis could be and usually is behind every corner
for some this good for some this is bad
some people enjoy walking through the city for hours and not having to worry about running themselves out of herbs and ammo every ten minutes
however for most others it adds a great suspensful feeling to the game and makes you feel more and more like your action do matter a great dealas for the controls no one will like them at first
it is sort of an acquired taste that most survival horror games have when ti comes to controls
since all the camera angles are stationary it makes the game look better so dont complain this game utilizes the up arrow as always being forward
some people seem to understand it better if you explain as being an rc car whether face south north east or west up wil always drive you forward
there realyl is no way around this configuration it really is best to dive right in and get used to it even if it means being massacred five minutes in a bunch of timesin conclusion i would not pick this re in particular for anyone new to the series
with the inclusion of nemesis you are required to make split second decisions and it will often confusea nd ultimately lead to the death of more novice players
if you are new to the series try re  re  has a few problems present for newer players but re  is the perfect balance of horror and simplicity
if your a veteran to re look no further for fun just dont expect it to be a cake walkwhen i got resident evil  i couldnt wait to play it
first of all it has the beautiful talented and smart jill valentine
she is a fighter all the way she doesnt need no man to protect her and this game proves it
it starts out with jill trying to escape from the zombieinfested raccoon city
she finds brad vickers another from the first resident evil
he tell her that quothequot is coming for stars members which got me interestedlater something happens to brad which i wont ruin for those who havent played it yet but when i saw quothimquot i was scared knowing he was after me
the best part is that he chases you through the whole game popping up when you least expect itjill meets up with carlos who is completly pointless except for a little part you have to control him
other than that jill is the superb heroine
proving women can defend themselves without men
i would recommend buying this game and loving every suspenseful moment
play it in the darkresident evil  was a well done game great detail along with a good story add puzzles and zombies and a huge hard to stop monster nemesis scary tone and music and you have one hell of a game
a worthy addition to add to your collection of games
recommende to fans  of resident evilif you envy resident evil code veronica envy
dont worry about it although the dreamcast has resident evil code veronica with its flashy graphics and all the game isnt due for quite some time i think
although the psx may not have dcs graphical capabilities they are still not bad considering the dc is  bit and the ps is only  bit
re has some of the best looking graphics the psx has ever rendered
the fmvs are perfectly compressed and they look better than those found in final fantasy  the game still uses prerendered backgrounds like all the other resident evils as if it was a ritual
the character detail is fantastically smooth and the main character jill is very nicely detailed
she is complete with some of the finest looking skin touch ups any re game has had
as for the frame rate it always stays perfect and doesnt drop at allalthough some people might say quotbeen there shot thatquot to re they should still play it due to the new challenging puzzles the game has to offer
the weirdest thing in the game is that its more of a prequel than a sequel
the game takes place  hours before the nd resident evil
it starts out with zombies attacking rpd members and ends up with all of the rpd officers dead while there are still tons of zombies on the loose
you will eventually meet up with barry from the first re too
now for those of you who find the resident evil series a little too hard youll be happy to know that when starting resident evil  and picking easy mode you start out with an unlimited number of ink ribbons and a hefty amount of ammo
you just have to get in the office room at the very beginning of the game
you will also come across some very familiar places in re  like the rpd conference room in re and the rpd station its self
believe me this is by far one of the finest moments of the psx and is the best resident evil game ever even better than code veronica for the dc
the game also features tons of dialogue which most of takes place during an fmv sequence
your main goal is to stop nemesis who is basically the granddaddy of all the zombiesthe game has admirable voice acting to make the gaming experience feel better
its voice acting is usually done correctly being very precise and on time so dont expect voice acting timing like in silent hill
youll experience some great sounding explosions and the gun shots sound unbelievably real
if you turn up the volume and play with the volume set on very high when a zombie pops out you will probably need a diaper change but you will get retribution by blasting his head of and hearing the clarity of sound effectsthose of you who have played the first  games directors cut excluded will already be very familiar with the controls
but those of you all three of you who havent will have a little difficulty with adjusting to the controls
me on the other hand im a huge fan of the series and i know the basic layout
but dont worry about it youll have time to practice your controls in the beginningwrapping up this review i can say that resident evil  is not only the best of the series but it is also one of the best psx titles out there today along with the top quality titles like final fantasy  tony hawks pro skater and syphon filter  this game is very fun plays quickly and offer a lot new features wish it was longer though but the game is a little more difficult than the previous resident evils but still funwell well well here it goesthis game has a just amount of creepy and scary cutscenes but still i lowered the volume and but the hell outta this gameit gives ya a fright and takes u to the zombie kick ass game not the number  resident evil game s better but it sure worth it to give you a frightunlike many other critical gamers  i found this to be one of the better resident evil  games 
dont get me wrong  the first two are very good  but this blows them away 
you get way cooler weapons  you can mix your gunpowder ammo  and fight tons of awesome monsters 
not to mention  nemesis  on your tail all through the game as well  even though it may seem a shorter game  and not an actual sequel to the second one  it still has all the elements you expect from a  resident evil  game so turn out the lights  turn up the sound  and prepare to be scared to sheer enjoyment 
and a closing word to the wise  steer clear of  survivor  
it is horrible and not worth the money one bit and pick up  code veronica  as well 
another classic one in the series i got this game when it came out wich was around  and boy did this get me scared
jill returns in the game to escape a hellish nightmare that was once raccon city
the game has a lot of twist and turns so it will keep you on the edge of your seat
i was up till am and still wanted to play
i managed to get it finished and over with in  days
the puzzle solvingwas a bit tough near the end
nemisis was by far the best re creature ever made
just the way of his figure and look made me love this game
the game is overall fun and a little chalenginga bit
jill will need to kill solve and trust her way into escaping raccon city
i baught the game also on gamecube wich had no difference with this versian except that gc had a tad bit sharper graphics but that was because it was an import form the dreamcast versian so theres really no versian
i recommend any versian for this game cause there all good and theres nodifference
the cgi of the game was also the highest point of the gameso go out and get the game
its the best in the seriesi also recommend the remake for gamecube and zero
and  of coursethe hardest puzzle of all noooo
you need to line up wave lengths a b and c so that when they pile up on topof each other they cause the result to look just like the sample
these from jesse main slipknothotmailcomtheres  possible solutions a   right
b   right
c   left
a   right
b   right
c   left
a   left
b   left
c   right
a   right
b   right
c   lefteven with the solutions it still might take a little bit to do this
irecommend writing down what you do then if it doesnt work do it backwards toreturn it to its original position
then try another solutionthis is for the water purification puzzle towards the very end of the game
if you tried something diffrent and got it please email me tstrongaolcomwow what a game i got this game and i tell you this is a great game from up to up it doseit matter this a great game buy it i loved it dont buy the st one buy  and  thats alldino crisis was released way back in  on the playstation
it was directed by the same director of the original resident evil
and producer of the next it came out at the peak of survival horror popularity but was more than just a clone of resident evil
obviously if youre searching for this game  years later you must know something about it and the genre
this is probably a must buy if you like these types of games
i would say get resident evil  and silent hill first howeverdino crisis featured full d background not prerendered ones like resident evil
it was much more advanced
you have a limited inventory but have different types of healing items and ammunition for each gunand of course no zombies hereoh no dinos
much faster than those old creepy zombies
the game environments were excellent and the music really added to the atmosphere
its definitely in the style of a late s resident evil game which is a good thingsome came with a resident evil  demo which was cool and resident evil  of course came with a dino crisis demo
pick this one upan awsome game
the graphics are amazing and what i found most impressive about this wonderful survival horror game is the fact that even the gameplay itself is like watching a movie
just seeing regina walk down a darkened cellar as things that tear and claw human flesh are active about is an impressive cinamatic event and almost an fmw sequence within itself
the gameplay is fun but at times a little frustrating but almost every game is a little frustrating
a lot of gore and although im not into gore too much i still thought that this game was an awsome event and its something that you dont wanna miss out on
its games like dino crisis which show off the wonderful and moneys worth of a playstation one even if the system is considered a little outdated which i dont think is true at all since i believe that playstation is still worth playing
get the game it is so incredibly fun that it is unbelievableremember playing this as a kidif ya likie dinosaurs you will like this game
if you enjoy survivor horror games this is a good one to playkeeps you going and the story line is goodsteven spielberg proved that dinosaurs could be menacing and terrorizing and this game only adds to it
this game is similar to resident evil also from capcom but more dangerous because the dinosaurs actually run and jump over things to eat you unlike sluggish zombies
rather than stalking screen to screen like with resident evil you can now run through a room and the camera will follow you making for great chases dinosaurs chasing you but unfortunately this leaves the player at a great disadvantage because the camera is focused on the player not the room so dinosaurs constantly get the edge lunging onto the screen
a huge plus to the game is the production because hard work went into making this game and story excellent
the cinematic scenes to start with are of a higher quality and are very detailed from breezing hair brushing plant life to seeing the scales on a dinosaur
the dialog is not cheesy or over acted as in other survival horror games
there are nice visual details which no screen shot can show such as the lighting effects are realistic a light sources computer screens ceiling lights illuminate on whatever the source hits
an unfortunate detail of this game is that whether you are bitten clawed or pounced on you can actually bleed to death without proper medical supplies
another downfall of the game is that the item screen is not as neat and tidy as resident evils screen
this new system is rather difficult to use
finally with the start screen there is no cinematic introduction that will tip anything in the game to the playerthe graphics are well done
the game play is pretty easy
the mix of shoot em up and thinking man puzzle play is great
it took me awhile to get through the first  hour without getting my butt whooped but once i  got the hang of everything it became very enjoyablethey werent joking  about the realistic violence and gore
watch out if youre at all  squeamish
it also has a couple of different endings depending on how you  play the game so it has a lasting appeal to iti recommenddino crisis is a great horror game and its alot like resident evilstory the story is good but not as good as reident evil i dont like spoiling the story so you will have to buy the game and see it for your selfgameplay the gameplay is great not as scary as resident evil but still pretty damm scary the game engine is just like reident evil the game is basicly resident evil with dinasoursgraphics for a ps game the graphics are amazing everything is so detailed and real looking great graphicssound great sound and voice actingcontrolls the controlls are hard at first but once you get the hang of them its a breezeoverall a great game what are you waiting for go and buy it alreadyit would be unfair to pass this game by as another resident evil rip off because although the basic premise is the same it is actually a very different game in every respect
and with the exception of   dino crisis easily excels any of the resident back cataloguethe graphics are very good and use a different technique than re allowing for much more user interaction
in re the graphics are made up of prerendered backgrounds but dc uses polygonal characters and backgrounds to better effect and look very much like the areas they are trying to convey
this style of graphics works better than in re and heightens the tension very wellthe gameplay is more innovative than in the re games with more puzzles and less emphasis placed on action
dcs weapons are reasonably feeble compared to those in re but this works for the better
instead of just splattering every enemy you come across you need to think of alternatives as shooting everything will soon either get you killed or make you run out of ammo fast
throughout the game you have to use security fences to your advantage running past a raptor when its back is turned past a sensor and then turn on the fence much better than just killing the raptor and more satisfying to bootenemies are also more intelligent than in re games as they would need to be and will chase you through doors and follow your trail of blood
they are all also more agile than those in re and so those encounters you cannot avoid are made even more visceralthe use of puzzles through the game is also well done and some are real brainteasers they are also more inventive than in re such as finding the right combination of gases for a poisoned room to gain entry or searching corpses for fingerprints to make a keycard
much better than res simple need key find key approachthe enemies in the game is where it starts to slip a bit with not too many variations in there but this isnt much of a problem as dino encounters are not all that frequent anyway
the way the dinos are presented to you is good and the ways you are encouraged to beat them is refreshing
such as guiding a pterodactyl into a fan or electrocuting a raptorthe main boss although it hd to be a trex is better a good alternative to the tyrants in the re series and provides a constant menace much like in re and always seems to be breathing down your neck
even when you think youre safe he bursts through a window or finds some way of spoiling your daythe longevity of the game is pretty much what you expect of a game of this type a fast play through can take approximately  hours but the first time took me about  the game length did surprise me though as at one point i was sure that i had finished the game but i was only half way throughthere is significant replay value in the game with three endings and many different costumes to be unlocked and with the game made in such a way you can play through and experience it differently each timeoverall there is not much to gripe about with this game and i really cannot find much fault with it at all
although the game length is expected with this sort of game it can seem annoying to others for it to be over so fast but with mgs the game is so enjoyable that this isnt a problem
also hardcore blasters may complain about the puzzle orientated gameplay but if you ask me its far better this wayid give it a rarely does a game come along that has  it all
lots of action cool dinosaurs to annihilate not too hard puzzles  and lots of fun playing in generaland a very good playstation title to boot
i loved playing this game a lot  and equally loved  dino crisis   as well
lets hope they put out another title for ps  in the future and that is as good in action as this one  and lots of cool dinos like the second onethat was the only flaw with this game  not a great amount of dinosaurs to wipe out but the ones they had were cool to fight  trex is cool  but im agreeing with my wife  raptors  rule
so if you are bored  new to playstation  or want a new rare cool old game to playthen look no furtherget it today
but i suggest you get the guide  as it is a big help in difficult areas play on and play playstationcapcom did an excellant job on this game
besides your gay comrade rick who is completly useless
and gay no really i think he is gay mainly because of his cheesy jokes and his weird apperance
oh and then theres gail who strangely resembles nicholai from re
which is also a good game
but any how onto dino crisis the game has an excellant plot and a very hot protagonist named regina
where would capcom be without a hot girl the voice acting is very good compared to resident evil  jill sandwhich and survivor the phone hang up the charcters were dedecated to their voice acting
surprise
usually capcom screwd that up
the controls were easy to navigate and to remember also they were responsive
the gaphics were great for a ps game
the velociraptors had decent ai for the time all except the random red forcefields that some of them were trapped behind
they run into it
which is hilarious to watch
youll see what i mean if you play it
the puzzles are not to hard unlike re water treatment puzzle
god help if u dont know the motive to the puzzle
the puzzles in dc are easy to figure out
and are not frustrating
all three weapons were useful in their own way
for example when fighting the t rex
lord help you if u dont have any grenade rounds
after that you are pretty screwd
the camara angles werent all that bad
the auto lock on is required
dont ask it just is
over all a great game
a must buy for capcom fans
hint steer clear of dc
dc is also very good
happy dino huntingi have a ps now but this wuz my st ps game along with crash warped  stars buzz lightyear  star and thats all i remember
but even with the ps this game never ends and never gets boring except the outer space levels and i recommend it even though its for ps especially at the cheap price its sellin fothe yellow dot that eats lots of other smaller dots debuts in his first d platforming adventure
the controls are nice and friendly the visuals are pretty and the gameplay is more than just a bunch of jumping and bopping enemies
the original pacman arcade game is included as well for posteritys sake
original ideas and interesting uses of classic material from pacs past are integrated in a nearly perfect meld of old and new in this title which went on to inspire a marioesque series and spinoffs that lasted to the end of the following console generation
great for the whole family
runs on playstation this product is excellent and works very well i recommended to buy it and have fun with it
its very goodbeing a s kid this was a musthave for me and i loved this game
unfortunately i lost the disc several years ago and have been without it since until recently when i purchased a copy from amazon
this is undoubtedly the best game i have ever seen especially for ps since most of those games are quick and easy
quite the opposite with this game
ive only gotten halfway through it because the bosses are so hard
try playing anubis rex andor space galaxian and youll see what im talking about
this game may have been released for other game systems but none retains the quality and feel that the ps version does
by the way if you buy this game ms pacman maze madness is the perfect complement to this one
it is also quite complex for a ps game
yes there still are new pacman video games being produced all the time recently pacman and the ghostly adventures but none have the feel of this onethis is the most fun game that i have ever played for the playstation
it has so many grets features which i will explainexamples of animations and corresponding soundscannonspirate levelslava ruins levelslazers space levelsspinning discs mirrors funhouse levelsfalling objects factory levelsfloating coffins ghost levelsof course there are others that are in every level like enemies and ghosts
this game is filled with excellent graphics too
they are excellent for the age of the game and are very diverse
i love the variety of the levels too
none of them are boring or anything like that
all just excellent
there are enemies at the end of the group of each level
some are easy some are very very hard
king galaxian and anubis rex are some hard levels
but they are possible to beat just keep trying
nothing is wrong with a challenge
the background music chosen is great as well very suitable for the level
the sound effects are great
there are so many of them
i highly recommend this game ive been playing for years and still enjoy it
even in this day and age it is a good idea to buy itpacman world is a great game for playstation and playstation  owners
you get  modes of play including the original pacman game as well as a d adventure mode and a d over the top dot munching game
all  are very fun to play which makes this game a very good valuerecommended for those looking for a cheap fun game for their psone or psmany many s icons of video gaming have tried to make the leap to d platformers
most have failed
though credit is due to frogger who keeps on trying
keep it up buddy youll get there yet
but outside of the mario franchise few pixelated critters have the staying power to stay relavant in todays gaming world
anyone else waiting for super q bert landone of the limited exceptions to this rule has been pacman
the worlds first video game character not counting faceless space ships and tanks he beat mario to the sidescroller in pacland and stared in two adventure games of his own in the snes days pacman  the new adventures and pac in time
so when the gaming world went d in the late searly s he was primed and ready to make the switch as wellthe great thing about the first pacman world is that the developers were able to mix new style game play in with classic elements to create a game that new players and seasoned pros alike could enjoy
the multiple new mazes playable feel like a blast from the past while the platforming levels that make up the bulk of the game explored what was then new ground in a consistantly entertaining way
the game established moves for pacman that would carry over into two enjoyable sequels and featured plenty of old favorites like pacdots fruit and those pesky ghosts in new and exciting settings
it also established pinky as female before all ghosts were assumed to be guys
except for sue of course
now if youre only familiar with modern kidfriendly games you might be surprised by the difficulty of this game
some of the bosses are maddingly hard to defeat and the amusement park level will make you want to renounce power pellets and stick to zombie hunting
but if you enjoy a challange this can actually be a plus
if not the gameboy advance version plays surprisingly well and doesnt have most of the boss levelswhile not my favorite of the world trilogy this was a great continuation of a classic series
heres hoping that future pacgames will recapture the magic of this entryive reviewed the laterreleased game boy advance version of this game a while back but this is the real deal
i may have recommended the other version but this original is infinitely better making the other one look like crap
my playstation library certainly isnt big but i know for a fact that you need this gamefirst off the presentation is topnotch
you are treated to a couple danimated fmv cutscenes
and then bam
as soon as the level begins you wander at the amazingly colorful graphics catchy lighthearted music and as you start playing the gameplay will get you hookedthe gameplay is somewhat basic
you can run jump rev roll like sonic s spin dash move and throw the pacdots you eat to create small explosions
fortunately it actually makes for a very fun time especially as you progress through the levels
there are lots of tweaks in each level filling things up with neat detail and differentiation
it could be a little hard to judge distance for where you would land after jumping but youll get used to it quicklythe bosses are surprisingly very hard
unless you go onto youtube or something to see how people beat the bosses chances are youll be wasting a good amount of lives
but let me tell you this king galaxian is the best boss level ever
it changes the whole gameplay letting you control a spaceship instead a la galaxian and galaga and shoot rows of alien ships
and then comes the boss itself which still throws bad guys at ya but also tries to suck your ship toward it galaga
throughout all that the music and even just the concept of the level makes up for what may possibly be a little frustrating boss fightoverall this is a true musthave
its a game with some of the best music graphics and gameplay all around that a pacman game could ever offerthis game is awesome and is one of the best horror games ever made it takes a while to get in tobut once you doyou will love playing this gameit is a really long game  to  hours with very complex levels and has a great mature story linethe voice acting and story is one of the best i seen in a video gamethe graphics are really good and is the one of the best looking version out of the psdcpc versionthe music and sound effects are really good and will scare the hell out of youit is one of the most mature game you will ever play and no one under  should play this gameits rather sad with all the advances in video games i rebought a n got this game again and realized that since my younger years its still by far my fav
game
the story is just amazing the gameplay is great for it being n
nowadays the campaigns are so damn boring i draw most of my attention to online multiplayer gaming
this game deserves more than five stars brutal twisted story
speak of games they should make a remake out of for a superior systemthis game ranks pretty high with all my other games i have and i have a lotthis game is full of surprises
it was probaly creepy for its time but its not as scary to me
the game is about a man named michael leroi also known as shadow man who is on a search for dark souls and other items that will help him put a stop to legions wishes
there are two worlds liveside the real world deadside kind of like an underworld
the music is very good
it feels right for the game
theres a song in a place called london in the sewers where one of the bosses you get to fight is jack the ripper and the piano music it plays later on the level is very familiar
you will know when you make it that far
the sound is very loud and it can be heard from all kinds of creatures especially the ones that may sneak up behind you
shooting in the game is fun especially when the player can choose the hand a single weapon can be in or they can just go dualwielded
further into the games many items and relics and can be found to help you progress through the game even more
it will take a long time and changes will occur in areas you been to before
example louisiana is bright until you find the item that lets you bring the power of the shadows to the real world which will instantly make it night
many unlockable characters can be found through the levels
you have to unlock them from doing a certain act which a message would appears cheat unlocked and it goes into a list called the book of shadowssecrets
its a good story and the levels are fun but finding certain items can be complicated
this game is very time consuming
about over  hours of gameplay
i beat in about two weeks and found everything
it was worth the time
there are great memorable moments to be had here
great music story secrets levels and bosses to keep you busyi played this when i was  recently acquired a n and wanted this game i had a n emulator for my pc but using the keyboard to control it was terrible
now i can play on my ni have played this many times for the n and recently picked up a psone
this game is still a very good game but i suggest the playstation version
i just bought the playstation version today and the graphics are a little better and the musicsound effects are much better
now for the n versioni have to say this game is quite gorey but hey thats what i like
this is sort of a actionhorrorrpg game
it has very complex puzzles and it really works your mind
when i rented this the first time and had no clue what the hell was lurking behind me or around the corner i was scared as hell
i played it at  at night of course so i was prone to be scared
wouldnt you be scared
i just got to the part with the skinless creature with the razor sharp tounge
luckly i defeated him with the shotgun
he wasnt all that hard but i got scared and ill tell you whyi was walking up to the door and out of the corner of my eye i saw this red thing walking outside past the window
i heard this noise and i said quotoh my god i am going to diequotseriously that was a pretty scary moment
anyway the graphics are exceptional for the n but playstation are better
the musicsound effects are better on the playstation but are acceptable on the n
there are two people you can pick and two difficulty settings
pretty nifty
there is a violence setting where you can have it high medium or low
kids under  i suggest low
high is pretty bad when you die
medium is averageworth your money but i suggest getting the playstation version of itthe quotresident evilquot series has always been bloody
ive played through each game so many times it just isnt funny anymore
and this is  the bloodiest one so far
and maybe the scariest too
taking place not too  long after the first quotresident evilquot the story this time takes  place in raccoon city itself
an outbreak virus has spreaded to the town  and as youll quickly learn its people as well and everything has gone  wrong
recruited by the now infamous rpd leon s kennedy arrives to  start his new job
but the rookie cop isnt alone as tomboy claire  redfield rolls into town seeking her lost brother chris from the first  game
the two of you have to find a way out of the most dangerous town in  the world
just like all the quotresident evilquot games you have your  sidekicks too
leon was always my favorite male main character throughout  the series and his sidekick is my favorite of the subcharacters her name  is ada wong whom you may remember from the first game as a code
claire  is my least favorite of the female main characters jill valentine was my  favorite and her sidekick sherry birkin is the most useless little girl  in gaming history
quotresident evilquot is a lot like capcoms other  masterpiece series quotstreet fighterquot the second installment  outshines the first one in every way imaginable
youre arsenal now  contains a bow gun equivalent to the pistol basically a spark gun  equivalent to the bow gun a machine gun fun to use but eats ammo a  little too quickly and a gatling gun more powerful than the machine gun  and more funner too
as well as custom parts to your pistol three bullets  at once shotgun packs a wallop you couldnt miss a roach with this  thing and magnum its almost like an elephant gun serious damage only  the gatling gun and rocket launcher are more powerful
claire has the bow  gun spark gun and grenade launcher exclusively while leon gets the  flamethrower shotgun and magnum to himself
obviously leon has the  better weapons
there are a variety of different looking zombies too  including the first female one not that i cared i blew her head off just  the same
the other new enemies didnt seem all that scary or even  challenging
mostly annoying especially that licker
of course the bosses  are new and more impressive than the first quotresident evilquot
other  notable improvements are the graphics the way the characters react to  being hurt for example leon uses his shotgun as a crutch when enough life  is lost the amount of zombies on screen and the scare factor
you can  get four different endings in this game which ensures lots of replay value
and getting to all four endings has a different path
if you beat the game  with leon you can save the game and come back and play it with claire  which will be a different path than the regular one claire has and the  same goes for claire if you start it with her leons path will be  different
the most notable difference in the second route is the addition  of a new tyrant that stalks you throughout your journey
hes tough hes  scary and he pops up at times you least suspect you arent given a large  area to fight him usually its a hallway or average sized room
thats  why i believe this was the scariest quotresident evilquot as  tyrant never really dies except for well im not gonna spoil that
my only problem with the game was the difficulty factor
it was too easy
and the puzzles were probably done by a four year old no really theyre  that bad
puzzles such as finding a plug thats ten feet away arent  very challenging
maybe capcom decided to take the game in even more of a  bmovie direction than it already had their lines were always funny  werent they
nevertheless this stands as one of the best  actionadventure on the playstation but its better on the n
why
the  graphics were better the game runs smoother on this platform and best of  all no loading
theres more secrets in this one than any other  quotresident evilquot
much better costumes two for leon one for  claire the super zombie brad vickers the pilot from the first game the  colt saa
basically the same as the normal pistol but claire holds it  gunslinger style and reloads very fast you get this with her one costume  while leon fires his normal pistol with one hand only and gatling gun and  lets not forget our poor umbrella trooper hunk
hunk is another character  in the game whom you play as for a side game
you play your own difficult  little quest in which youre trying to escape with the gvirus
was that  quest too easy for you too
really
then try it with tofu
the funniest  thing ive ever seen in a video game
but also the hardest quest ive ever  tried
im a hardcore gamer but this quest was too difficult even for the  likes of me
all in all this is probably the best quotresident  evilquot so farim one of the biggest fans of the entire resident evil seriesresident evilresident evil resident evil  nemesisresident evil survivorresident evil code veronicai love all of these games and to tell you the truth resident evil  was my favorite it had the most intresting characters claire redfield  leon kennedy i think and story line was awesome and even better the graphics on the n
so i recommend this game  anyone who isnt afraid of bloodshed aloti just recently replayed this game for the first time in like  years
i had only played it on the ps back in the day
gotta say it holds up really well
the graphics still look nice the puzzles  action are as fun as ever
my only complaint it the controls are kinda hard to get used to
definitely one of the early d games that hadnt figured out how to utilize the joystick well
it can be irritating at times
but otherwise still a great game all these years later
and the n port is nice because theres really no loading at all
pick it up if you loved it back in the day its still greatresident evil after the tvirus outbreak at the mansion claire redfield and leon kennedy search what used to be raccoon city for survivors and try to escape the city
this game was a huge improvement over the originalresident evil
this is my rd favorite game of alltimegraphics for its time these graphics are extremely crisp
all characters look really good on the n
the only problem with the graphics is the cutscenes are grainy due to being compressed so much to fit on the n
they put a lot of work into making sure the rest of the game looked good though and it doesstory claire redfield is looking for her brother chris redfield
chris led the stars
team into the mansion on the original game
claire finds herself trapped in raccoon city with tons of zombies and other strange creatures
leon kennedy a brand new stars
member also finds himself deep in the city on his first day on the job
they meet up and go to the raccoon city police department to escape the zombies
little do they know the zombies are there as well
they split up and look for survivors and then try to escape the city together
each character meets interesting people on their way to escaping the city and on the way learns about what happened to the citysound it cant be perfect its an n game
despite the sound of guns and walking being off everything else works well
the music is creepy and fits the game good
the zombies and other tvirus infected creatures sound very disturbing in a good waygameplay you play as either leon or claire
both of them have interesting stories and different gameplay elements
as leon you will use magnums shotguns and flamethrowers as your characteronly weapons
as claire you will get bow guns a grenade launcher and a shock gun
this means you will have to survive using different weapons
if you beat the game as one character you will earn a bscenario that allows you to play the game from the other characters point of view
this creates a total of  games all in one
not to mention the  secret scenarios you can earn
this game makes you tense and freak out at moments
the n version allows you to change the blood color and change the violence level in the game
there is also a randomizer mode that changes around all the items in the game to make it that much more difficultdifficulty  note this is how much i like the difficultythis game can be really hard in some spots but generally you are facing mindless zombies
the bosses in the game can be a really intricate challenge if youre not smart about ammo
thats another thing keeping up with ammo on the harder modes becomes a huge challenge
you want to save ammo for a really hard enemy but there are tons of zombiesoverall this game is extremely fun and tells a great story
you can play through  times without it ever being the same game
also if you put randomizer on you can play through again and again just to challenge yourself
earning the  secret scenarios will keep you busy enough as it is
this game gets a this vendor is quite something
they sent me exactly what i asked for the resident evil  n port in nearly half of the predicted shipping time and that was on normal shipping
this package is just a cartridge though no original game box or anything
aside from a few scratches on the back labels and some dust in the main receptor it was perfect
my order couldnt possibly have gone bettereste es el juego que demostro al mundo de lo que el n puede ser capazgraficas increiblesfmv horror al maximoloved playing this game when i was like  or  bought this in college and its still so good
but when you get older its so much easier to beat making it better to play all the story modesresident evil  is a great game and every resident evil fan has to have this game best horror game on nresident evil  by itself was an outstanding entry in the survival horror genre
the tvirus has taken over raccoon city and you play as either claire redfield or leon kennedy in a desperate attempt to make it out alive
the graphics sound and intentionally stiff controls make gameplay a tense and often nervewracking experience and the intricate storyline draws you in while throwing zombies and other bizzare mutations at you
plus after you finish one game you can go back and play as the other character and experience events from their perspective
then do the whole thing in reversed order for up to four different gameplay experiences
and thats not counting the secret missions and other bonus goodieslike capcom did with street fighter alpha  for the super nintendo they did the impossible again here and crammed a cd graphicsheavy game onto a cartridge
angel studios did the job and used massive data compression along with a megabit cartridge to fit everything in
the result is a game pak that is physically heavier than all the other games in your collection
whats even cooler are the new features including a highres graphics option and  surround
the only thing that takes a hit are the prerendered cutscenes which are pixelated from compression
but its a small price considering no one expected the game to fit at allgreat for the novelty value great for the gameplay experience
resident evil  must be in your n collectionthis game is cool the gameplay is cool and everything that people state about games are cool but do not and i mean do not let children  and under play this game
it is extremly violent extremly bloody and extremly grose
you do nothing but go around and blow up zombies that devour living human being
not to mention this game will give you nightmares
i played the one for playstation and it is exactly the same as this violent bloody gross and extreamly scary
i have to admit when i played this at a friends house i got nightmares for three nightsback before capcom made negotiations with nintendo to release all of the new resident evil gameswell the main story ones first on the gamecube nintendo fans missed out on all of the re games
so it was nice of capcom to finally allow the n to get a piece of the re series
although the fmvs arent as crisp as the pss the overall graphics look better on the n
as with the other games in the series re has you picking a character and basically trying to solve puzzles and collecting items while trying to stay alive
throughout the game you are constantly being attacked by zombies and other various mutant creatures
some people say that re is their favorite game in the series and while i would have to say that re is my favorite re is still a great game
dont be afraid though of being freaked out by this game because it is not scary at all
the other games in the series seem a bit more creepy and startling at times while this game seems more about action most of the time
so if your looking for a great game for your old n then this is one of the best out there for iti am not an expert of arcade games or rpgs or anything other than mario or tomb raider games but this game is so fun
i never played the arcade versioni didnt know one even existed at all i havent been inside an arcade in ages so i am clueless there
but what i do know is that this game is a standout on n
connect four controllers and have a blast
the graphics are greatin my opinion of course and the game is challenging and requires teamwork
there are  players to pick at firstfour variations of those then four more characters can be discovered
the new characters are pretty neat and add more replay value
anyway i think that you should buy this game if you know what is good foror if you are cheap then rent itone of the best games ever i love this game
tons of different characters and abilities monstersamazingthis game has so much replay value
i used to rent this game all the time but never got to buy it as a kid so im glad i bought it now
it came in like perfect condition toogauntlet was the original quotget four people and feed in a ton of quartersquot video game when it came out over a decade ago and the arcade version of gauntlet legends took this a step further with more complex weapons and terrain and characters that remind me of my old favorite golden axe
so i was overjoyed when the n version of legends came out and its just as playable as the arcade version thats captured far more than  of my tokens in the standup version
the graphics arent perfect but they are a good rendering of levels and it play is quick and easy to figure out
the characters are easy to control at first although you might find yourself with instructions in your lap for a while to figure out how to move between weapons and magic items
the real treat is when you get two or more people together to duke it out and move through levels
its great to have a game that doesnt use split screens or some other distraction to enable friends to play together
the music and voices are cool and theres enough gameplay to keep you busy for a while
this game doesnt try to push the envelope or take things too far but its a great way to get together with people and fight some monsters for a few hours which is exactly why i like it so muchsure dreamcast has its place and is now resting in the video game graveyard but this system was good very good
but the thing is people wouldnt trust sega after failing one too many times and being the underdog in the gaming world so they had a feeling the dc would fail as well
but its potential was great it had many great titles such as soul caliber shenmue sonic adventure   crazy taxi the list is endless the grpahics are amazing
the system is very loud though the engine makes alot of noise when loading the disc
they stopped making games for this system so if you are planning to buy it buy all the games you can fast because they are being taken off the shelves of many stores
the sports line for the dc is fantastic bolstering some of the best sports games ever made thanks to the k series
if your an rpg freak well they have great ones as well like skies of arcadia grandia record of loddoss war just so many no matter what you are a fan of
dont let all the bad comments get into your head because if you think its bad you are going to belive that its bad
remember you need a vmu for the dc for the best playing experience or you wont be able to save games most game take up  or less blocks unless its a sports game which takes up a huge ammount of space like  blocks
an extra controller would be a good idea as well
this is a great console that just wasnt given a chance
enjoydreamcast is by far my favorite
it has very fun games as youll read in tons of other reviews
none of the newer consoles have met my expectations half as good as the dreamcast did back in the christmas of 
this is coming from a person who owns  consoles including the  wii gamecube ps etc
those consoles have fun games but coming after the dreamcast they are more like novelties to me
if you dont get a dreamcast you should at least get the ports of its games such as sonic adventure  crazy taxi skies of arcadia shenmue ii house of the dead  and many more
i still buy games for my dc off of here
most can be found in good conditionwhen i first told my friends i thought about getting a dreamcast they warned me that i should go with something else
but i found sega to be respectable in the past so i figured that i would go with this machine
i was not disappointed one bit and my friends were a little caught off guard i would go against their advice
but i thought that it was a very good machine and its graphics just blew me away
i liked its play as far as sonic adventure cause ive always liked those types of games
what also drew me to the dreamcast was the ability to have arcade games like house of the dead  blasting out of my television
so i found that the dreamcast came to the appeal to methe sega dreamcast is sort of the james dean of consoles
it had a very exciting launch coupled with great games
it ushered in many advances in the console scene some that are just coming to light
many great games where released in its short life span
games like crazy taxi jet grind radio shenmue powerstone phantasy star online resident evil code veronica nfl k series and a few others
when it launched things where looking good for the dreamcast and sega
gamers where amazed by the graphics and sound finally we had realistic sports games
systems where selling at a brisk place
sega managed to turnaround some of the naysayers
the dreamcast had a tough battle even before it launched
segas reputation for abandoning their hardware to early took their tolls
developers and the gaming public where skeptical from the start
still some rd party devolopers took the chance and consumers did as well
after the first year the sony ps loomed on the horizon
sony overly hyped the ps graphics capabilities and promised a gaming experience like no others
rumors where spread by sonys marketing department that sega would abandon its hardware
it encouraged consumers not to buy the dreamcast but instead wait for the ps
it was a david and goliath marketing battle
add to this the ps came with a dvd playerlow end no name brand dvd players where around 
initially launch ps games looked worse than dc games however sega never really used this to their advantageadd to this a workaround was found to easily pirate dreamcast games with no mod chips
the little profit sega was making from software sales diminished because of this
disputes and indifferences with sega america and sega japan also contributed to problems
sega was bleeding money soa wanted to continue the fight but sojsega of japan president pulled the plug after a short  month period
the innovations sega tried to usher in the gaming public was just not ready for it at the time
also the dreamcast was caught in between generations early on developers didnt utilize the systems full potential
most games where ports of ps and n games or games that didnt look much better than ps games
sega relied on shenmue to rescue the system like sonic once did for the genesis
inevitably shenmue had a determinable effect sega pulled its last remaining resources on this game
the initial game cost  million to develop
the game was a game that you either loved or hate
it didnt sell well and in fact put sega even deeper in the hole
they where many hit games on the dc but they never had that  game that made people go out and buy the dc
meaning there was no game that developed enough of a buzz the dc had its share of great games
soul caliber helped with the initial launch to sell systems
at one point max payne was been developed and halo as well
one can imagine if these games where released it might of helped
although the developers of halo deny a halo build existed for the dc
hallife was supposed to be that killer game unfortunately it was canceled as by then the dc was essentially on its way out
although you can find it as it was leaked and the game was essentially  completed
i myself think sega gave up to quick and would of like to see them hang on for another year
but rd party support was pulling from the dc scene by the droves
today like james dean the dreamcast is still loved by many loyal fans in fact games are still been released by indie developers
most of them dont do it for profit but simply for love and admiration for the dreamcast
it still is thinkingwere a something couple who recently bought the sega dreamcast for our own gratification
its a blast although our constant complaint is that theres not enough games for it
of course
we only want multiplayer games we can play with  people and they are hard to come by unfortunately
our favorites so far are sonic adventure soul caliber and powerstone  which we highly recommend
we wish the controllers were more comfortable they dont have rubberized buttons and eventually hurt our fingers
other than that though we appreciate the high level of interactivity the beauty of the graphics and the simplicity of the interfaces
its a pretty good bang for your buckhello
my name is erica
and im a dreamcast addict
gasps from the crowd  donkey kong stands up glaring
i know that ive been loyal to  nintendo for many years owning everything from the original nintendo to  super nintendo to color gameboy to nintendo  and game boy pocket
i  remember in the days of super nintendo a new system coming out
sega  genesis i believe
and i spat on it fearing the competition sonic the  hedgehog would give to my friends mario and luigiive never liked  sega
actually i never gave it a chance
but i was growing bored with my  nintendo  games
my little brother still like them though if that  gives you some clue
then for some reason before i could even think  about what i was doing i bought the dreamcastwowevery single  game ive played i loved
each time i finish one im like quotthat  was the best game ive played in my lifequot  then i finish the next  one
and im like quotno that was the best game ive played in my  lifequot  and so on and so oni had thought about perhaps saving my  money to buy the playstation 
nintendos nextgen system is just way  too far off
but i started looking at some of the games they had planned  for launch
none of them look neat
each one is either a sports game or  an action game
none of them pulled me to drool over every screenshot and  eagerly await more news as i had for many dreamcast games
sony just pops  out games left and right and theyre all mediocre at best
there are a  few exceptions  ive always enjoyed tomb raider kind of
but being a  female i was able to look beyond lara crofts impossible body and i saw  how much gameplay they lacked and how much monotony they hadwhoa ok  back to dreamcastin conclusion i have to say that this system is  definitely a gem
people are getting nervous now because when playstation   comes dreamcast could just be cast into the same fate as sega saturn  was
which is really too bad
but the one eyeopener that caught my  attention is the fact that the dreamcast is  cheaper then playstation    sure ps can play dvds but dvds dont look too hot if theyre played  on an older tv and to really get some use of them you have to have a  little satellite thatoh whatever
and whats with that shimmery  effect that all of pss games have been having
haha could they hurry up  and fix that alreadyanyways i said goodbye to yoshi yesterday
i  slammed the door in lara crofts face
then i shut the windows locked  the door and turned my dreamcast onwhen the system first launched i was a young high school kid delivering pizzas
i was also a huge sega fan and needed the newest system big time
it was september th i had to drive  miles to the nearest funcoland and waited inline for  hours during rain and thunderstorms to grab the sweet new sega system  due to the fact it was rainingmany people gave up  i still remember hooking it up the  next morning and skipping school to play the  games i bought launch night sonic adventure  house of the dead  and soulcaliber
that was the best day of my young life  i digress the system was well built and i was rough on it
i bought  or so games for it and i recently was cleaning my home to get ready for my second child and came across a box from my parents house  that had my dreamcast all my games and many accessories
i gave it to my  year daughter and she loves it
were a big game family  if you do buy a dreamcast they are built well so dont worry to much
in terms of memory the controller has a slot for a memory card called a vmu those come in several colors and are kinda cool  also when buying on amazon check to make sure all the cables are included and the necessarycomponents are there
some games i would recommendsoul calibersonic adventuresphantasy star online any of themworld series khouse of the  dead jet set radiosega bass fishingshenmue  a bit pricy but amazinghappy gamingharris eugene blakei have been a huge video game fan since i was born and i have never seen anything like the dreamcast
sure on playstation  you can play dvds but the games just arent as fun to play
the dreamcast also has what i think is the most comfortable and easy to use controller there is
plus the vmu makes things even better
no more having to worry about what you should save because now you can delete your files
plus its fun to watch the little movies and play the mini games on its visual screen
you should definently buy the dreamcast if you like video games
nothing will ever be betterok so it was left in dirt by sega
who cares
it still has the sweetest games and awesome controlerthough i must say it is very ugly
the vmuvisual memery unit is the best memery card for any system
my favorite games are  all the ks ks and ks  sonic adventure  crazy taxi  and  soul calibur
sure ill buy a ps xbox and ngc but dreamcast is going to keep me busy for a whilethe sega dreamcast is in a word awesome
the graphics that this system puts out are second to none even with the debut of the ps
graphics are sharp and crisp on the dreamcast which cannot be said of sonys offerings in the game system market
the lack of a variety of sports games in my only caveat
i only wish that i would have the option to choose between a few different varieties of baseball games for example
it would have been nice to have had an option other than segas abysmal world series baseball k last year
that being said most of the other games i have purchased have been outstanding
games like test drive lemans star wars demolition and nfl k are really great games
i only hope that sega will produce more versions of their games beyond this year
the  price that the dreamcast is available at today makes it a great bargain that is well worth picking up especially if you can live without the dvd player of the ps
check it out today its well worth itfrom my personal experience over the last year or so i have been very impressed with the sega dreamcast
this awesome console by sega launched with a plethora of aaa titles and it never ceases to amaze
with most recent titles like quake  shenmue nflk and nbak the dreamcast has the strongest software library around putting the playstation  to shame
plus you can play most of these games online via seganet which is a big plusload up a copy of soul calibur or resident evil code veronica and your jaw will drop at the attention to detail and playablitity
dont believe the hype about the playstation  as a longtime gamer since the nes days the dreamcast is as best as you can get
so you get an awesome system at a great pricemake sure to choose the sega dreamcast as your system of choice this christmas
you will not be dissapointed i thought that the controllers looked really difficult to useit turns out that theyre not at all
it has the most intuitive controls of all the systems and it places the shoulder buttons underneath the hand grips where they belong
generally this system does what all the systems do better  bit graphics the best platforming system on the market and a great game to fit every gamers tastethe dc has a huge library of titles  bit graphics and everything on the system is what its advertised to be
this system is very worth it
the dreamcast will be remembered by the true fans tons of great titles and you wont get boredbottom line dreamcast has the goods and it has it now
numbers of  polygons vertexlighted trianges nurbsaside the system shells out  some incredibly smooth and beautiful graphics and nearly every game takes  advantage of the systems power
take some genrebusting games like soul  calibur and sonic adventure perhaps the most fastest rollercoasterlike  d platformer in existence and you have one heck of a system
the games  often revolutionize the curve like jet grind radiothose who are  waiting for ps give dreamcast a try
theres more room than for just one  system on top of the tv and i guaranteed this system will not disappoint  in tandem with its bigger brotherthe sega dreamcast is a great game machine
i have been happier with this console than i ever expected
if you are dying to get a playstation  but werent fortunate enough to preorder one  months ago definitely give the dreamcast a try
you wont be sorryfirst of all the games are great they are unique and they are fun
only on the dreamcast can you play resident evilcode veronica crazy taxi sega gt space channel  jet grind radio sonic adventure f challenge virtua tennis seaman samba de amgio soul calibur or power stone   nflk is an outstanding game and most review sites consider it to be barely  barely  behind its playstation  equivalent
games like tony hawk soul reaver and jedi power battles feature better graphics and other improvements over their psone cousins
also consider the huge titles just about to be released  shenmue grandia  skies of arcardia quake  nbak halflife
that still leaves other huge titles like virtua fighter  black and white phantasy star online and shenmue  for next year and beyond
the dreamcast has a great futurechances are you have tried online gaming but if you havent you dont know what you are missing
another human being makes a game intense especially in a fps like quake  or halflife
right now only the dreamcast is online
join the seganet isp for  months and youll get the dreamcast for free
again most amazon shoppers probably arent new to the internet but if you are shopping for a family who is without a computer or internet connection the dreamcast is the cheapest easiest way to get them online surfing n emailinfinally you will not be losing much by waiting a year to buy your playstation   for the cost of a ps you can buy a dreamcast and  great games
for a ps youll shell out  plus tax and still need to buy a game
next christmas anaylists predict that sony will be selling the ps for  and by that time the console will have many more great games out for itthe sega dreamcast has a negative connotation of being a medicore system from its short life span but you shouldnt let that stop you from purchasing one
there are plenty of great games that are actually worth buying unlike its predecessor the sega saturn
the saturn is still a good system but great games on it can cost  upwards such as magic knight rayearth albert odyssey or the infamously priced panzer dragoon saga that goes at a whopping 
there are excellent titles on this system such as sonic adventure  evolution  grandia ii skies of arcadia and quite a few more
sure it was not able to compete with the gamecube xbox and ps due to financial trouble on segas part from poor sales of its predecessors but is a plethora of great games worth playing on this system and they are reasonably priced since they had good print runs despite the system itself being shortlived
the vmu was quite innovative for its time considering that it can tell you many different things such as the characters status the amount of time spent on a particular game and so on so forth
though its life span was very short much was accomplished in such a short amount of time releasing games that were quite ahead of its time as they always had
though this console never had the same level of success as its competitors its worth picking up for its price as it still has quite a bit to offeri remember when the sega dreamcast was released everybody thought of it as this mythical system that would take gaming to a whole new level
when released it had great games sonic adventure power stone nfl k and such onthe games are fun and the controller feels great there have been suspicions that the xbox  and xbox  controller was designed from it
graphics are great for the time and still arent a eye sore even when compared to todays system graphics it holds up fairly welli defintely would consider the dreamcast in the top  best gaming systems of all timei love mine so much its scarythe graphics are absolutely beautifullthe sound is crisp and crystal clearthere is a huge library of games for this system so no matter what gaming genre you are a fan of there just has to be something youll lovethe load times are quick and on some games there is noneas if this werent enough you can go online for some multiplayer actionthis is the best video game system i have ever play periodbuy this and you will not regret it trust mehaving this system again has allowed me to reexperience so much of the fun i had years ago
resident evil games shenmue railroad tycoon  these are just a few of the games that this great piece of hardware powers
i love the ease of organizing game files on visual memory units and the way how the time date settings remained accurate over long time periods even with the system unplugged
really worth havingthe dreamcast is definately the ultimate gaming system  bit  million polygons per second does it get any better than that
i will give you the answer no
now dont say that the ps is better
to be just perfectly honest i dont care if the ps has a dvd player
i dont see why i should spend more just for a dvd player
people say that the controller is too big
that is just another excuse for the ps to be better than dreamcast
go dreamcast
go sega
i have not had any trouble with my console after buying it used
the dreamcast consists of good quality
the graphics are equal to ps
and the loading times are the best compared to the ps
the dreamcast has many great games for itthe legend will live onthis is my favorite system of all time
there are alot of great games on the dreamcast like sonic adventure  and  chu chu rocket jet grind radio tony hawks pro skater  and  mdk sega gt test drive le mans alien front online crazy taxi  and  power stone  and  fighting vipers  japan or european release king of fighters  japan release ikaruga japan release headhunter european release ooga booga metropolis street racer marvel vs capcom  and  which the dreamcast version is the best version over the playstation  and xbox sega bass fishing  and  rez japan or european release shenmue shenmue ii japan and european release soul calibur resident evil code veronica rayman  the great escapedead or alive  tennis k skies of arcadiaphantasy star onlinegrandia iilegacy of kain soul reaverunreal tournament street fighter alpha  samba de amigo f challengequake iii arenaultimate fighting championshipready  rumble boxingspace channel  daytona usa san francisco rush ready  rumble boxingtokyo xtreme racer street fighter iii double impact sega marine fishing and toy commander
dreamcast also over  total unique games from the north america european and japan region
just get dcx and you will be able to play  more games than the  games in north america
dreamcast has more unqiue games than nintendo  which has about  gamesthis is the best video game console i have ever owned and i have almost owned them allincluding the playstation  for all out fun and enjoyment you cant top segas dreamcast
throw in online gameing and you add multiplayer fun when you have no one to play with at homeif you dont already have on ego and get one you wont be disappointedim a fan of the dreamcast and spent countless hours playing marvel vs capcom  back when it was new
just an excellent machine with ideas ahead of its time
i still think it wouldve sold better if it had a dvd drive but i guess things were tight for sega back then or something
anyways i got this for collection purposes but it also has some great games
if you were to investigate you would find games that were made for the ps but also put on the dreamcast
the dreamcast would benifit from smoother textures and perhaps shorter loading times
resident evil  is an example but there were others as well before the ps came outyeah we all know that sega has stopped making dreamcasts
they followed the somewhat questionable buisness formula of taking a loss on the console and hoping to make up for it with software sales
this as you can guess did not quite work right and now sega just makes software
which is a pity because this console is so good
i have a ps and a dreamcast
they sit side by side in my room
i get id say about an equal amount of mileage out of each
bear something in mind though
i use my ps to play my original psx games ps games and dvds
i use my dc for dc games only some are imports since i have my console chipped to play them
meaning if you break it down console wise i use my dc much more than my ps
the dreamcast is very quickly becoming the hardcore gamers platform of choice due both to the high quality of the games and the fact that its the one console nobody thinks to get
its every real fanboys dream really an unused console that none of the mainstream press pays much attention to that has a wonderful stable of games that far exceeds that of the ps at least so far
if you like fighting games a dreamcast is a mustown
the ps despite what people may tell you is not as good at doing anything d as the dreamcast is
all the good fighters are out on the dreamcast and theyre there to stay
when capcom vs snk  comes out you can bet that ill be pounding away happily on my imported dreamcast version while everyone else boots up a ps to play itand i own a ps so its not like i dont have a choice
in fact itd be cheaper to get the domestic ps release the import dc version is a flat  more than id pay for a ps game
the dreamcast is host to many innovative games that many developers wont risk on other platforms
jet set radio shenmue crazy taxi  and so forth
the system is almost on par with a ps and in many instances will get a better framerate
rayman  is a good example of this
looks great on the ps to be sure but the dc version looks just a little better
the dc would be hard pressed to pull off something like devil may cry but that wave of games is not here yet and the games the dc has now will be good no matter when you play them
shenmue is spectacular looking no matter what you stack it against
dont get me wrong i love my ps but i wouldnt give up my dreamcast for the world if you dont own one and you even remotely consider yourself a gamer you owe it to yourself to buy this console
remember once theyre gone thats it
sega isnt making anymore after this and youll be kicking yourself later when you have to buy one on ebay cause you didnt act nowi just bought the dreamcast a couple years ago and still one of favorite game systemsi have a snesgenesisnplaystation    and a xbox  most of these systems are greatbut the dreamcast has the best d fighters and arcade that i remember playing back in the day when they were populari have a lot of the games i use to back in the day like house of the deadsoul caliberstreet fighter alpha  and capcom vs snk are just a few that i own right nowthis system is still really good because the dreamcast has hardware similar to the naomi arcade machines so most of the games are almost identical and some are better than arcade like soul calibersega done well with the dreamcast because they did the opposite of sega saturn when it comes to gamesthe games are diverse and range to platform games to dd fighters and action adventures and most of them are still are not bad and look similar to a ps gamei think sega was targeting people with this system that wanted arcade style games while sony did the samebut with a dvd playerin  sega stop making systems after the ps out sold the dreamcast at salesbut now it is just a software company instead which i am glad they are still aroundi recently bought a hori ps joystick and used a ps adapter and its way more fun than using the dc controlleri would highly advise everyone that doesnt already have the dc arcade stick to get an hori arcade joystick or xarcade stick and a ps adapter to get to the whole arcade feelthe dc system has mostly arcade fighting gamesso people that dont like this system probably dont like fighting gamespros ahead of its timevmu is amazingcontroller is comfortablegames are cheapgames still look goodgreat fighting gamescons some games look badstop making gamesnow doesnt that make the dreamcast look inexpensive to you
it really is a great deal
dc has some of the best games ever made read shenmue or soul calibur or worms etc
its well worth picking up so i hope everyone who plays games does sothe slogan for this console is perfect
it offers changing scenerios as you play because the console is able to adjust itself to your ability to learn and your actions
it is compact easy to use has few wires and offers hours and hours of video game excitement
it is fantasticby now everyone is ravening about psx
great graphics builtin k modem and dvd
chances are you probably have a dvd already sitting in your stereo cabinet or it is in your desktop
why pay the high price for something your already have
besides the dvd dreamcast is no different than the psx
the graphics are the same all the games are played the same dc has a builtin k
the only differences are the price
think aboutwhen i originally saw segas stellar dreamcast in action the day it launched on september   i remember thinking that console gaming had finally matured and arrived in grand style
up to that point in time no previous video game system had the polygonal pumping power or blazing speed of segas dreamcast hardware to produce the spectacular and wondrous visuals that countless people around the globe had been enjoying for years in arcades
though nintendos bit behemoth along with sonys colossally popular playstation were very admirable machines with extremely solid and respectable game libraries neither came swaggering out of the corner looking for a fight swinging as furiously or packed a punch quite like segas powerful like the dreamcast
it was a machine that was truly ahead of its time and set a new qaulity standard in the industry that was hard to match
while classic much lauded launch titles like soul calibur sonic adventure power stone crazy taxi hydro thunder marvel vs capcom new age of heroes and nfl k showcased the dreamcasts impressive jaw dropping and drool worthy graphical capabilities it was another launch title by sega chu chu rocket that reminded the world what helped make the dreamcast an important part of gaming history
granted you had to subscribe to seganet to take advantage of this heralded feature but now a person was not only able surf the world wide web with their sega dreamcast using the included browser disc and integrated k modem but could also play games online a realm that was previously exclusive to pc
gamers
segas console is a rock solid and attractive unit that is pleasing to behold and was built to last a long time
the dreamcast controller is similarly well designed and assembled
its comfortable to handle for numerous hours making it a perfect for weekend long gaming marathons
the buttons are well laid out on the right side and colorful opposite of the analog thumb stick which is positioned above the dpad with index finger triggers on the underside
it also has two expansion slots to accommodate various accessories like visual memory units a rumble pack or even a microphone
the only strange thing about the dreamcasts controller is that the cord is connected at the bottom but can conveniently be secured forward on the underside of the unit
the visual memory unit resembles a miniaturized version of nintendos original gameboy with a monochrome lcd screen positioned above the dpad which was next to the start select a and b buttons
not only could this little marvel save vital game data but it could enhance the experince in numerous ways too
this could be a mini game like pintas quest on skies of arcadia raising a chao in sonic adventure or displaying play calls on segas awesome k sport games
sega had a smash hit on its hands with the dreamcast but it wouldnt have been worth anything if there wasnt quality software that took advantage of the systems powerful cutting edge hardware that was genuinely enjoyable to play
luckily the dreamcast amassed an admirable collection of classic and beloved games to build a strong library in its short life that proudly endures today there is something for everyone
the previously mentioned titles are only a brief taste of the untold hours of fun and adventure that awaits the owner of a sega dreamcast
other classic platters like grandia ii jet grind radio legacy of kain soul reaver phantasy star online space channel  shenmue  metropolis street racer virtual tennis and countless other great games are still waiting to be discovered on the sega dreamcast
nearly a decade since it debuted in north america its still thinking keeping a firm hold of gamers hearts and imaginationsive had this system since it came out and i love it
for the short amount of time it lived it put out an awesome assortment of great games
i just refurbished mine to restore it back to its original state
i love this thingi never got it but now i have it great system it has graphics like ps and sbox done and i love all the games i have for itsegas dreamcast may be dying but its still awesome
with a bit proccesser it makes it almost as good as ps
so what if it cant play dvds
they are plenty of great titles for dreamcast including tony hawks pro skater  sonic adventure  nfl k and crazy taxi
dont underestimate the dreamcast
get one before theyre gonethe dreamcast was a gamers system
not only was it the first bit system out the gate it also built up an incredible library of games before its untimely demise
it was really the last system to feature good d support for fighting games such as the street fighter series and snk franchises
it also was the only platform to carry the first soul calibur arguably the best d fighting game of all timein addition to the fighting games though the dreamcast offered a library of games that seemed geared more towards quality and playability than massmarketability
space shooters like mars matrix and hardtocategorize games like shenmue set the system apart from others
its just too bad sega had to give up on the dreamcast and will most likely never make another console againthe day the video game world was changed forever
sega launched its sega dreamcast which had graphics far superior to anything else availible
it also had internet capability to play games over the net and could also play music cds
the dreamcast was very succesful in its first weeks on the market selling more than  in its first weekbut in january  sgea announced that due to low worldwide sales they would stop producig the dreamcast and become a rd party developer for the other systems never to make another dreamcast system or any other system again
thankfully sega would still support the dreamcast until march  in between those times is when the best dreamcast games were released
nfl k nba k nhl k daytona usa crazy taxi and sonic adventure  were all released between those lines
but here march  has come and gone and the dreamcast has passed on with the release of nhl kbut that does not mean an any way that you should not buy a dreamcast
you can get a dreamcast  controllers a memory card nhl k nfl k nba k sonic adventure  shennmue daytona usa crazy taxi  and  other games for the same price of a ps or xbox one controller one memory card and no gamesthe dreamcast is a great deal at  and you cant go wrong with any games
i think the dreamcast is the best deal on a video game system availible right nowthis is a great system
sure its dead and theres no more games being made for this ancient relicbut this thing rulesif you have about burnin a hole in your pocket you should grab this
it has some great games like crazy taxi crazy taxi  power stone power stone  some street fighter gamessega was a great company its a shame they were replaced with sony and microsoftwhats the world coming tothe memories brought forth from this console are so rewarding
such a warm feeling comes over me whenever i play it thank youi recently acquired a dreamcast and what a system
i cant believe sega pulled the plug on this marvel
i at one time doubted the capabilities of this system until i gave it a try myself
the graphics while not important to me rival those of gc or ps
i almost broke down and purchased one of the big  but decided to save my money and go with the dc
im not breaking my neck to get an xbox or cube not while im having fun with this systemas for games you have tons to choose from and no one is left out
jet grind radio shemue crazy taxi quake iii and i can go on and on
most games are in the  range so you can get a nice selection of games for what you would pay for one xbox or ps
the controller while it is big is easy to useso if you dont have the money to drop on a nextgen system get yourself a dreamcast while they are still availableyou dont have to be left out of the gaming party due to low fundsif you owned a playstation  you were probably on the band wagon for playstation  from the get go
i have owned just about every game system ever released
the dreamcast was one of those moments in video games where gamers got a gamers system
the opinions all around are wonderful for it
the games at launch for this system were by far the best out of any launch ive ever seen
i think it has a certain nostalgia to it
when i found out they were stopping production for it i was a little heart broken
it was the first time i was gonna stick with one system because i was so happy with it
them pulling it out early will make it stand out as one of those times in my life where something as great as this system failed to early and was successful to late in its afterlife
so yes i hope if you read this and want some great gaming moments you buy this system
you will not regret it
i never did and never willthe dreamcast was without a doubt a great console
but like all great things such as the nintendo  it died out
i really think that they should have made a lot more games for it but i was already satisfied with the games that were out
any body who likes resident evil would have to agree that resident evil  and code veronica were great games
powerstone was pretty fun to along with sonics adventure
i would recommend this system to anyone that doesnt mind  playing older gamesthis console would be even worth its money if it would cost two times as much as it does now
i love the dreamcast
why
ill tell ya why its a bargain if youre buying a psone over this gem then i cant think of an other reason than youre plain stupid
the dc doesnt deserve all the negative publicity it got superb games soul calibur virtua tennis dead or alive  nba k unreal tournament quake iii shenmue the list goes on and on
and they will bring out more games about  including half life and sonic adventure  stunning graphics im not joking now but some games even look better than the overpriced and overrated playstation 
fire up jet set radio quake  nba k and you know what im talking about interesting internetdevelopment you can play mps snes games genesis games movies vcd and so on by downloading small tools on the internet
the internetcommunity loves this console and i cant say theyre wrongif youre buying this console its worth it believe me
than buy a visual memorycard with it its required for almost all of the games
buy it nowim not a hard core gamming person
im  years old and i work long hours behind a computer i come home and i want something to relax to thats not going to require large amounts of my timethe dreamcast fit the bill with a great price and game library right out of the local arcadewhy buy a dreamcast so late in the game
because although its over a year old if you judge a game console based on both  its technology and its game library the dreamcast is the best console on the marketthe price point is also outstanding especially since you get a k modem and an internet web browser with the system there are many games that are online ready as well
you are not tied to a sega isp either that makes this the most inexpensive sittop internet appliance on the marketwhen it comes to games i like arcade games
if you like arcade style games sega makes some of the best and here you have perfect i mean perfect arcade games
you can also buy many of the first generation games for  or lessthe playstation  is another machine to consider imho the pss current crop of games do not justify its heavy price tag also if you have a dvd player on your tv you are wasting money buying the pss dvd player since the dvd has proven to be a failure for software delivery
the dreamcast has a very powerful graphics processor its inexpensive and its quality control department works overtime to make sure only quality games are released
the ps will eventually beat it out there are games like quotmetal gear solid quot but thats not relivant when you consider that playstation will always be at a disadvantage when it comes to great arcade style games
sure they have namco and williams but so does sega see dremacaast versions of soul calibur and ready  rumble and sega has their own brand that makes some really incredible games that are unbeatable in fun but untill ps catches up dreamcast should be your  pickbuy onewith this being the  year anniversary of the announcment of the death of the dreamcast i thought id write a eulogy
it started out so right it seemed sega was going to be able to fix the errors of years past make the comback that they deserved and reclaim their title as king of the arcade
with launch titles such as sonic adventure soul calibur crazy taxi it seemed almost too good to be true
it had revolutionary features
the vmu was the first which was a handheld system and memory card that provided a lcd screen for the controller that changed based on game and context
next was the built in modem it allowed not only internet access and web browsing straight out of the box but also supported online play a first for consoles
it had the first mmo phantasy star online free to play
but it also had other games that were amazing project seaman with its voice recognition through the microphone jet grind radio which was the first to feature cell shaded graphics shenmue was the first to feature a massive open ended world and the countless acade perfect ports of games like marvel vs capcom  street fighter alpha  and hydro thunder
it was the last japanese and arcade based system
it had everything a  gamer could ever want it was affordable reliable inovative connected revolutionary powerful and had a massive library of games from every genre
it had core and casual games single and multiplayer and had online and offline games
its such a shame that sega made all the right moves but no one cared
if you conisder yourself a core gamer you owe it to yourself to look at this system one more timefarewell dreamcast you are missed you may be dead but your games live onrest in peaceits true i finally broke down and bought the dreamcast
i had owned just the ps one im a big sports game player and i simply couldnt turn down the sports bundle i got nfl knba kws baseball k and the quotdreamquot for  bucks
the other bit systems out cant come close to the dreamcasts pricesmemory cardsxtra controllers are affordable also
pros include small size sweet graphics amp super quick load times my sole con has to do with the noise she makes while on a tad loud i think
however i feel its an overall great value for the money and it will hold me over until systems like the ps amp xbox become more affordablesega
 star value for surethis console had a short spotlight life
it was king for  months but sadly the ps killed it
i wanted one back in  but sadly i had a n
sad isnt itanyway it has a lcd memory card with buttons and mini games a  gb cd capacity and a revolutionary controller and internet browser
i reccommend this to anyone with a tv and moneyorder the game gear from this seller so i also ordered the dreamcast
everything came with the system and more
was some cd case that had what looks like burned games on cdr didnt expect this and was very satisfiedhavent tired the system yet to see if its working but i have it mainly more for my collection
will be ordering again from seller
the only down side was the box all my stuff came in was really beat up and no packing at all
looked like it was all thrown in the box
if someone was to drop it im sure the dreamcast would have broke
i may have got very luckyi bought sega dreamcast when it launched in  and to tell the honest truth i had some doubts
but then after i had bought  or so games for  the thing i knew it was best
even if i do and most likely will buy a  playstation  dolphin or xbox i know ill always have a place in my  gaming collection for the dc
i now have  or so games for it and i love  every one of themthose of you gamers that are so obsessed about  playstation and nintendo that you beleive sega dreamcast isnt and never  will be worth it you are missing out especially if youre going to buy  psx just because of the improved graphics on  of the old playstation  games anyways bleem for dc is coming out on sega this august  which will  be able to play  playstation games in  bits in which playsation  will only play them in  bits
so if youre one of those big jerks who  hate sega because of previous systems and wouldnt in your right mind buy a  dc you are missing out
go ahead then
miss out
hate
youre just making  yourself less happy
scroll up and buy a dreamcast right now no matter  what your friends sayyou just have to buy one they have the same graphics as ps and gamecube have which is  bits and the only thing i really dont like about it since it is the first cd game system sometimes when you are in the middle of playing a game it may just go to the systems main menu but that is very common if that happens just take the cd out and clean it by rubbing the cd on your shirt
when you want to stop a game you first hit open and than take the game out than close the disk door than hit power because if you just hit power than open it up it will not put on the brake
which can damage the dreamcasti bought this back in september of  when it first came out
i was excited to play it
i couldnt believe how small it was compared to my other consoles which i had the original playstation sega saturn and the nintendo  the first game i end up buying for it was sonic adventure
which is a pretty awesome game the graphics were amazing bright and colorful
later on i would end up buying games like shenmue crazy taxi and jet grind radio
the dreamcast was ahead of its time but it died too early
it has a great library of games so i highly recommend itif youre a fan of d fighter games its here on the dreamcast
capcom vs snk  import vampire hunter chonicles import king of fighters  import marvel vs capcom  jo jo bizarre adventure street fighter  collection samurai blade  mark of the wolves sega ages volume  and sega saturn have tons of d fighters and shooters a lot are import so get the dreamcast and saturn to complete your d libraryyou know it was quite sad when i went to a friend who considers themselves a hardcore gamer and i told them i just bought a sega dreamcast they said a what
i said you know the dreamcast the last system sega ever made he told me i was wrong and said that the saturn was the last system they ever made we went on the internet where he found out he was wrongat the end i could not blame him though he became hardcore off the ps generation and had never really heard of the dreamcast which is not surprising because it seemed almost like a blink of the eye it was here and it was gone before its proper generation had even really started the dreamcast was doomed which is unfortunate because with this last system sega unleashed a beast and it is awesome now on to the pluses and minuses the sega dreamcasts design is awesome very compact has four controller hook ups right out of the box a k modem to get on the internetthis was the first system in which major consoles took internet play seriously k was good for the time and runs off gds which i believe means gigabyte disc which is basically a cd dual layered that stores over a gig worth of memory on it it also comes with a memory card out of the box which goes into the controller the k modem is really out of date you have to buy a adapter to be able to get online and play the gd rom itself is prone to disc read errors after a length in time
some say that the durability of the system is not great
will update this laterbecause it runs off bigger versions of cds well gds and not dvd you will not be able to play a movie off this but music seems to work fine when you first touch the controller it may feel like your holding a piece of plywood however with that being said once you get used to the feel of the controller for some reason everything just feels natural and youll most likely love it and this is one area i am sorry i feel sega screwed the pooch on this one the memory card that comes with your system pending on the game may only be able to be used for that game and i am not talking like ps where you can have multiple games saved on the card and choose to dedicate it to the game i mean just saving a single game which means you will be running out buying memory cards left and right if you own games like nflk or seventhcross and any form of library for the systemhowever the official sega vmus has cool features with some games like mini games you can play off them and important information you can use in some games loading times the loading times to the dreamcast are faster then those of ps and compete with the more powerful systems like gamecube and xbox graphics sorry but dreamcast despite what sony fans say blows the ps out of the water in this area the cream of the crop games on dreamcast are consistently better then the ps and compare closely and beats at times the gamecube the only system from this generation that can beat the dreamcast is xboxand even then it is very close graphics however some games like timestalkers for instance looks like someone threw a cd rom on your n oh dont get me wrong it looks better then a n game but so much in the way a sega cd looked better then a genesis game the games hands down there was a load of classics on this system and they still hold up today it may be weird to some people though do to the time when this came out the library of games resembles what you could find on a playstion or n instead of a ps or gamecube but in actuality that is part of the charm of this system because alot of games from that era this is the only system you will find a next generation version of so you will get to see what a ps version of some of the great games from that time would look
like
it will bring back fond flashbacks and show you the updated version which makes this the system to own in addition sega unleashed masterpieces that are still in demand still highly sought after and since sega went third party still played and enjoyed by video gamers around the world including shenmue jet set radio and crazy taxi along with several others plus truly unique games like seventh cross well maybe not truly unique evolution has been done before on snes but it is a rarity and despite what most fratboys from other systems would say actually most gamers would agree hands down in total fun graphics controls and playability this is still the only place to get these games despite updates and sequels the only exception may be phantasy star online and skies of arcadia remake and believe it or not nflk along with some other sports titles are simply the best sports games out there hands down no amount of updates with madden or others can compare to the games you get here simply put it is the best periodin the end is a dreamcast worth getting in this day and age yes yes yes hands down if your a hardcore gamer it is a must you will get to see some of the most innovative games of their time that still hold up today you will get graphics that is simply jaw dropping and controls that feel natural  the only downside is prepare to either delete a lot of games or get a lot of vmus because you will need them and online play may be a hastle but still once you get past that this system is must ownthis game system o how it was slept on it in my past life unfortunately
please dreamcast never go away
please stay please stay please stay
it came on time and there was nothing wrong with itah man
i love the dreamcast so much and every time i play the one i have i almost start to cry because i can remember me and my friends used to play this over and over again
like my title says this console will and always be truly missed
the dreamcast has had a wide variety of the most funnest games ever and the most memorable ones too
my childhood will rest along with the most classic gaming machine on the face of this earththe day sega released the most powerful console ever in the us some of the games at launchor shortly after were sonic adventure nfl k house of the dead  hydro thunder soul calibur etc
all of these games had graphics better than anything seen on a console before
the revolution was about to beginbut shorly after i purchased this console way back in april  i heard about the playstation  and wondered if i made the right decision
then the ps came out
all doubts were gone
and by christmas i realized that the dreamcast was far superior
even though the dc didnt quite stand up to the ps specificationswise and in therms of hype it dominated in other categories
the dc at the time had better graphics more vramvisual memory full antialiasing  controller ports instead of  more gamesbetter games i might add better accesories more support a k modem and truckloads of truly great titles being released
yes december  was a great time to be a dc owner
but the great times were about to endin january  due to insufficent funds and low worldwide sales sega decided to pull the plug on the dc and simply become a rd party developer
many wondered if sega could survive as a rd party developer but once again sega proved everyone wrong
even though sega was no longer producing the dc they would still support it until march  and some of the better games came out between these times
daytona usa nfl k nba k nhl k wsb ksort of crazy taxi  phantasy star online ver and best of all sonic adventure which is possibly the best title on the system next to shenmuebut now it is march  the last game for the system nhl k was released and the era of the dc is over
but who knows
maybe is a few years a company will buy the rights to it and will begin producing more games for it just like majesco did with the game gearconsidering the fact that the dc game flow has stopped you can still pick up a systemif you can find one at least  or  games a second controller and a memory card or two for the same price or less than a ps or xbox which come with no games whatsoevereven though the dc is dead i still support it in saying that it is the best console on the market considering what it has done in the past
and if you own one im sure you will toohas never failed me yet
i have beaten all the games i got for it and it still works like newive always liked sega because of the great games they provided us with
who would have thought a game about a running blue hedgehog sonic the  hedgehog would be so fun
or that a worm in a power suite earthworm jim  would be so challenging
and after all these years of us having to deal  with lousy d games that have no deapth most of them d killers of d  classics sega finally rises to show us what games should be like
quotsonic adventurequot is probibly the first d game i liked that was  originaly d very unlikely that happens
plus with some of the best  games on the system thats out there i see a bright future for sega
so  what about the the other companys nintendo sony
well i was for years a  big nintendo fan untill they made the nintendo   what a waste of a  system
i see promise for their gamecube system but im going to be  cautious about it after what happened with their last system
and sony is  trash
always has been always will be
with that said this is the system  to buy
happy birthday dreamcastsega did not recieve neary enough credit for this beautiful machine
games like shenmue the virtua sports lineup and soul calibur were all so brilliantly supported on this transition system
few realize that this game console came long before its time as it was revolutionary in its gaming library
seaman jet grind radio chu chu rocket phantasy star online echo the dolphin and other unique games were simply so pioneering that no one really wanted to play them
everything about this system and its games drip with innovative content
this was the first system to use cell shading a coloring method that has become popular these days with games like viewtiful joe xiii and legend of zelda the wind waker
the sega dreamcast needs some love and appreciation
if you have one sitting around your house collecting dust brush it off and play it a little and if you dont own one pick one up and try it out
i can guarantee a very unique gaming experience
best of all the games on this system are extremely cheap
just give it a tryit is simply breathtaking when it first came out it was so ahead of its time some didnt beleve it could to what it was advertised to do
unfortunetly it is becoming obsolete but it was a fanaly worthy of sega
the dreamcast came out before the n but it is almost as capible as the gc and it rivals the psthere becomeing very hard to find so if you own one of these consider yourself lucky and hang onto it
in a hundred years it could be worth millions to some electronics antique shopltlaughsgtthe sega dreamcast is hands down the best gaming bang for the buck currently on the market
i picked mine up about a month ago and have not regretted the decision
although i am  years old and am a pc gamer at heart there are just some games that the pc cannot do well
specifically fighting games dead or alive  soul calibur etc
 which are best with multiple players and controllers and lightgun games house of the dead  confidential mission which are unbelievably fun with a lightgun mad catz makes a good one
and since pcs dont do multiple controllers well much less lightguns i was left with the dreamcast system as my only choice mainly because of its current pricepoint and its awesome selection of classic titles which by the way are also coming down in price since the dreamcast is out of production
my advice get this system while you can and as many games that interest you for it too since as time passes certain of these games are sure to become soughtafter collectors items indeed some already arethis was a replacement as the original hadbeen broken since it had been used so oftenand so muchi purchased a sega dreacast last christmas and couldnt be happier
the graphics are jawdropping and theres a truckload of games  or so by christmas  some titles like shenmu ecco the dolphin and soul calibur could be classified as works of art
as an engineer in the hitech field im always impressed by a design masterpiece you can be assured im impressed with the dreamcast
now lets talk about the ps ive studied the dreamcast and the ps for over a year by researching numerous design articles on the internet and unfortunately for sony the word is getting out the ps is a bad design
sony had great plans for a powerhouse machine but they all fell apart due to a serious design flaw that traumatizes the entire system
heres the bottom line the ps is severely limited by an anemic  mb video ram memory in the graphics subsystem this is the pipeline that controls video output to the screen everything must pass thru this pipeline before it appears on the television
by comparison the dreamcast has twice the size of the ps pipeline or  mb video ram memory
this still does not tell the complete story the dreamcast has a superior graphics engine that makes its  mb pipeline perform more like  times the pipeline in the ps yes thats right i said  times
this gives the dreamcast the ability to produce screen output the ps simply cannot match
this probably sounds hard to believe after all the hype youve heard about the ps but sadly its true
in a nutshell sony built a  horsepower ferrari and then fitted it with a ford pinto exhaust system
no matter how much power the ps engine can deliver the entire system is choked by the restricted output and software developers are left frantically scrambling trying to work around the problems this causes
surely youve heard the ps is difficult to develop for this is the main reason why
the results are quite revealing if you compare the top games on both systems youll notice the dreamcast is at least as good as the ps and many times its superior
the best example of this lies with two different fighting games tekken tag on the ps compared to soul calibur on the dreamcast both games launched with the respective system
namco one of the finest game development companies on the planet developed both titles
if it was within namcos power you can bet they wouldnt let the spanking new tekken tag on the ps be outshined by the monthold soul calibur on the dreamcast but thats just what happened
soul calibur is a masterpiece that dwarfs tekken tag in any comparison
another good example is ea sports madden nfl  for the ps compared to nfl k for the dreamcast
ea sports has everything riding on the ps and cannot afford to be outdone by the dreamcast
in direct comparisons some say madden nfl  has slightly better graphics than nfl k but read almost any review you want even some on sony biased sights and nfl k is the better game
moving on some dreamcast games are thought to be impossible on the ps these are jet grind radio shenmue crazy taxi sonic adventure ecco the dolphin and perhaps a few more
these games either have incredible detail and texturing fast moving free roaming d environments or both
because its choked by its design detail texture and fast moving free roaming environments are all difficult for the ps
in other words some things the dreamcast can do with ease are near impossibilities for the ps
chances are you havent heard comparisons like these before but they appear to be true
a few more things to mention if your considering purchasing a new game console the ps can play dvds the dreamcast cant that may be a selling point to some
on the other hand the dreamcast has an ace up its sleeve its internet ready out of the box and online gaming for the dreamcast is here right now today no fool in
how good is online gaming on the dreamcast
ive heard nothing but praise and worship for seganet they use a system that reduces lag over an analog modem that makes an opponent across country seem like hes playing in you living room
in the online department sony has completely botched up sega has a much better plan in place and sony will never fully catch up
one last point the ps plays old playstation games with the same quality as the playstation a certain selling point
on the sega side a new software product called bleem
will give the dreamcast the ability to play around  playstation games thru emulation with x the screen resolution graphics filtering and jagged edge removal that the sony machines cant accomplish
the dreamcast will be a better playstaion than the ps even a better playstation than the playstation itself
in conclusion if youre a sony fan and you dont mind the high price go ahead and buy a ps the games will get better as developers master the system
the ps is an adequate machine and will be a smashing success with the following sony already has its just not the revolution in console gaming that all the hype predicted
now if you think you want a ps because its a superior machine forget the hype save yourself some money and go buy a dreamcast you wont be disappointed
the ps is vastly overrated and overhyped the dreamcast is underrated and its time for the truth to even up the score
lastly if you are a budget conscious consumer buy a dreamcast over a psone anyday its x better bottom line the dreamcast is a masterpiece of design engineering and it easily rivals the ps in many ways its the superior machine much to sonys dismaythe deramcast has great games like sonic aventure  which is better then what ps can ofer in the same type any way ps is riding on popalry or words a fad so way waste money on a fad  and what if sega says there make dreamcast and stop in  years if  going to buy ps your out of luckcan you real think ps can be pop for  genarations in a row no it cantok im the loser who waited until early  to get this why did i wait
prosthe system laststhe controller is easy to usegraphics are beyond its yearsentertaining
conscontroller cord has short lengthif you unplug the system or leave it sitting for a long time you have to set the day month year time military time
and it happens randomlyvmus needed to play gamesoverallpros beats the cons this system is pricelessglad i could revisit my old gamesthe sega dreamcast was amazing
i dont know what it was but sega systems were always unique in someway
even their games were pretty fun
the only problem was that there just wasnt enough games for it
i think that if they released more japanese games in the us they could have survived another generation or two of systems
i really liked this system because it had a unique physical look and the gui was interesting
also it was ahead of its time
this was one of the first systems that could connect to the internet
the only problem there werent  that many games to play online
now  years later i still enjoy the sega dreamcast its such a shame that they couldnt continuei guess im just a sega fanboy underneath it all ive always been loyal to sega since the days of the genesis and ive owned the sega cd x i want my money back on that the saturn and the dreamcast
now recently i bought another brand and guess what i still play my dreamcast more  what killed the dreamcast was that it was too ambitious for its own good
online play made the system one of a kind  now the dreamcast wasnt a bad system at all
like i said the online play elevated the system to new levels and the library of games most of them were exclusive the system was trouble free and had one of the best designed controlers on the market
shockingly original gamesplus the best sports titles on any system made the dreamcast one of the best systems ever made and i for one will miss itdreamcast was segas final and surprisingly admirable effort in a losing war of console giants
the tragic irony of it all is this sega seemed to have finally learned their lesson after years of rushedoutthedoor hardware and lack of quality games for said hardware
the console was powerful and whats this lots of games
it would seem then that dreamcast was destined to redeem sega and restore her to her former glory
but instead a perfect storm of nope gathered
that storm of nope was sony ps nintendo gamecube and microsoft xbox
four consoles could not survive in a market that was already oversaturated
sadly dreamcast faded into obscurity
despite its early demise the games on dc hold up really well even by  standards
without a doubt the most underrated gem of any console generation
if youre a nostalgia seeker or just appreciate a solid gaming experience comparable to the likes of ps pick up a dreamcast
virtua tennis capcom vs snk  soul calibur power stone shenmue and skies of arcadia are just a few of the awesome titles worth checking outthis is the best sega system ever the game population grows for it every week i have only played four games on it so far but the games i have  played and own are real gemsconfession of a once sony fanboy ever since i bought the sega saturn and it died miserably i had my doubts about sega
the dreamcast was launched on  and i was at a toys r us when loads of people were lined up to purchase this system
i thought about getting it i had the money but i committed myself to never trust sega
i took sonys side and bowed to stick to sony
when the dreamcast dropped in price for  i decided to buy one because of the great d fighting games which are unavailable on ps or are poor attempts on ps
i bought the sonic bundle for  and stocked up on vmus and bought an extra controller
i bought all the fighting games i could get king of fighters dm  virtua fighter tb marvel vs capcom  capcom vs snk and ordered sf  rd strike
i also bought jet grind radio and resident evil code veronica
all i have to say is this i was wrong for not giving sega another chance
i love my dreamcast and i play it  more often than i play my ps
as a matter of fact i dont even play my ps or ps anymore i just use it for the dvd dreamcast is a great system regardless if it is dead
in the end it is the funfactor that counts and not the popularity
thank you sega for bringing forth a great system
the dreamcast is truly superbafter the fantastic saturn  sega took a break and started to develop a system to go head to head with sonys upcoming playstation  systemthe result was the sega dreamcast and it was incredible
the dreamcast was a marvel of processing power and high quality graphics which to the average gamer means a powerhouse in consoles and more important  excellent games to come your waythe  dreamcast had a unique analog controler similar to the n  but it felt better in the players hands and was more comfortable
i prefered this controller myselfyou could also have internet access  just like the sega saturnwhich was also a pluskeep in mind  this is way before microsofts  xbox live service and sonys playstation online network  folksthe graphics were stunninggames like marvel vs capcom  sonic air force delta spawn virtua fighter amoung others  really stand up even todaythis all changed when the sony playstation  came out  then  sega once again felt sonys bitebut they didnt give up  the made extra add ons and more exclusives but this still wasnt enoughall said and done thoughthe dreamcast  was the final entry into segas console fleetand it was a great addition its still fun to play with todayif your a collector  i highly recomment grabbing oneits thinkinglove that tagline they used  there are too many parties and too large of a userbase to just let die
look at these factors
the dreamcast has hundreds of third party software developers that rely on revenues derived from dreamcast users
they certainly dont want this platform to go away
they will undoubtly support the continued production and release of more games
sega has a huge userbase of dreamcast users
as a profitseeking company there is no reason they would not try to capitalize on either licensing the dreamcast or partnering there are rumors rumors rumors substantiated that the new microsoft xbox coming out this fall will infact have a dreamcast chipset allowing the play of dreamcast games
this means that the production of dreamcast software will not go kaput becuase developers will still have a platform to develop fori own the ps as well and as of now  there arent any decent games out for it
the dc has been out for a year
theyve got solid games and for  you cant really losethis thing was just as powerful overall as the playstation  and it had great games so what happened
bad business thats what
not only is it not compatible with sega saturn games or genesis but the exclusivity deals enraged stores not cut in on the deal
they figured that since they were to get the consoles after everyone else that theyd further delay ituntil pigs flyforget about them and get this the first true supersystem for the price of most used or million seller games and collect some of the greatest games ever made including project justice streetfighter  thirdstrike jet grind radio soul calibertech romancer virtual on oratorio tangram powerstone ampdead or alive  grandia  grand theft auto  crazy taxi and sonic adventure
you only have to buy it once it doesnt have a set shelflife like food does
itll always be there for you when you want to play it and it never costs additional money
there are far worse things that you could and likely have spent your money on that you cant account for now
you cant put a price on dreams but you can put a very low one for a dreamcast
you wont forget it
if you do forget you
seriously though get itwell im a little embarrassed to say that i just got a dreamcast about a week agobut still have vivid memories of all the commercials that were played and watching my babysitter at the time play it constantly until the ps came out
im going to review the system in parts because there is just so much to cover that it needs to be broken downthe system the dreamcast itself is very smallits not as long as the original ps but it sits a little bit higher
overall it looks very nicepictures dont do it justiceit needs to be seen in person
the dreamcasts power light is also very uniqueinstead of being the usual green colorits orange its supposedly a very lucky color in japan
it also has  controller portsand the usual hookup plugs in the backthe controller the controller is sort of a hit and missit looks really cool
but its lacking in the button departmentit has  face buttonsone analog stickdpadand  triggers
now the problem is the dreamcast controller needed either another analog stick or  more shoulder buttons
i have a very good feeling if the dreamcast would have been in the market longer it would have seen a redesigned controller
not the worst controllerbut not the bestit gets bonus points for possibly being the coolest looking controller ive seenthe visual memory unit vmu the vmu is quite possibly the most unique memory card i have ever seenit has a screen a dpadsleep buttonmode buttonand  face buttons
while your playing a game it displays either what game your playingyour healthor to choose plays in footballevery game does different things
some games even have mini games you can download onto the vmu
there are some downsides to the vmu and the number one thing is battery lifeit takes  watch batteries that cost  a piecehere is the kickerthey dont last long at all
it would have been smarter to just make the vmu use  aa batteries insteadthey are much cheaper and would have probably lasted longer rechargeable would have lasted much longer
and the number  downside is the memory on the card is small
only kb available for use there is a way to unlock kb more if your playing a sport game it can take as much as kb
most games will only use kbs dependinggamesthis is a high point for the dcat the time it had some of the best games for all genres listing them all would take up way to much space
it is unfortunate that most of the dreamcasts best games have been ported to either psxboxor gc
but there is something about playing the original that makes the games seem so much better on dreamcast
im going to list the pros and cons of the systemprosyou can still buy new dreamcasts for controllersvmus are a dime a dozengames are cheap and can still be bought newvery nice designreliable as long as you play legit software tipcdrs will burn out your dreamcast laserawesome memory cardconsvmus use expensive batteries that dont lastcontroller needs more buttonsthe console today is still great
there are so many games for this console that you can still easily find this day
it is still compatible with most modern televisions thanks to its svideo capability
the console is a classic but also has so many hidden gems you can really go to its wikipedia article and start to drool
further with its vmu capability and four ports for controllers it has aged much better than other retro consolesgames to get with thissonic adventure  and  two classic d platformers though  has aged much better than  they can still be found affordably and playing them on their original console dreamcast gives the best control experienced an obscure horror game that will have you hiding under your bed at night for weeks after playing it
this game made great and novel use of the vmu screenshenmue considered one of the best games ever made with graphics that hold up well even todaychu chu rocket great puzzle game with a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four local playersspace channel  a music game that has you helping a space news reporter you heard me dance
very bizarre very funcrazy taxi i cannot do this game justice in my writing
just go look up crazy taxi gameplay onlineand so many morewith its second screen in the controllers memory card and its amazing library of games this console is a boon to own today
used dreamcast games are often sold for  or less on amazon and that means you can quickly build a true library of games for a fraction of the costeven though the mighty sega dreamcast was discontinued around august  it remains my favorite gaming system even with the xbox and ps being wildly popular
the dreamcast has bit graphics which is still incredible and on the same powering level of ps
the game selection is excellent soul caliber crazy taxi shenmue mortal kombat gold dead or alive  and a bunch of others the dreamcast controllers despite looking awkward are very comfortable to use with all the buttons and triggers in the perfect places which provides fast response
another big plus is that the dreamcast has  controller ports playing with friends on san fransisco rush  couldnt be more fun
the dreamcast is very easy to hook up plays music cds and has an optional phone jack where you can go on the neti have never been more pleased with a video game console than with the sega dreamcast
great games great power great graphics and great features
what more could you want
log onto ebay or here at amazon to see if you can buy this awesome gaming machine todayi played a dreamcast
to be honest im waiting for gamecube
i dont need a dvd player sony
but i saved my pennies for ps anyway and i went to toys r us to buy a couple of ps games so that when my friends at amazon said we have your ps for you id be ready
while there i played san francisco rush  awesome
long story short for less than the cost of a ps and one game i got the dreamcast four games nhlk nflk rush  and jedi power battles and a memory pack
the games look and play beautifully in all their bit glory
and the hockeya first generation version i might addeasily rivals ea sports game
nflk based on what ive seen of madden ps at circuit city and online is just as good if not better
you get more bang for your buck with the dreamcast
i may even keep mine when the gamecube comes outthats how impressive it isthis was my teenage sons first game system
he remembers it very fondly and still had games for it
so i decided to purchase this as a surprise gift for him
he was so excited to have one again he broke out the games then and there and played all night longrecalling great memories from when he was youngeryou try to find a system out or coming out now that has internet access for multiplayer games
yeah other systems are going to have them but dreamcast has it nowi can still remember the day i had one of these bad boys
this system i believe was the start of those shiny d graphics that is in the new systems of today
the system came out i think in  or  and is still a good system to own
my pops bought it for me brand new from at that time funcoland
yeah you remember that video game store that used to rip people off now replaced by gamestop
you probably still remember the song tooi forget what my first game was but i know i owned crazy taxi and hydrothunder at one point
loved both of those games
very fun
liked hydro thunder the most because of the way the boats transformed when you went over a power up
the graphics were amazing at that time and the games where very goodi even had a gameshark for it that you plugged into the controller
i didnt per say like the controller to much the xbox seems to have modified the segas controller a lil bit especiall considering the fact that the original xbox had memory units you plugged into the controller itself just like the dreamcast controller the visual memory unit was probaby the best and is still the best memory card ever made in my opinion on any system from any year
the fact you can save and still play those games on it that you save is just amazing
no system has done that before and to tell you the truth probably never will since they all seemed to use hard drives nowi do remember some type of game disc that came out sometime in mid to late  or  that you can use to play your playstation one games on the dreamcast
the man that created the disc had i think just one game and that was gran turismo  i had that disc and remember the graphics on gt and  how so much more improved they werethe creator said on his web site that he was trying to get other stores to participate and sell his product if he can sell enough of them but that never happened
i remember going to his web site and seeing sonic the hedgehog standing by a tomb stone weeping at the death of the product he was trying to createthen the unthinkable happened
the dreamcast itself died
i think it was only in production for a year or so before sega pulled the plug
very sad situation
and to think that the dreamcast was on its way to become something big
but all isnt lost maybe the dreamcast paved the way for playstation and xbox to be where they are today maybe i dont know
i kept my dreamcast for another year and traded it in for the ps in  and traded my ps in for the xbox in  i never forgot about the dreamcast though and how great of a system it was to me and seeing this on amazon not only brings me back to when video games where really starting to get good but also just bring me back to my child hood
i think i was like  or something
but to me this was one of the best game systemsthe sega dreamcast wasis the last system that sega released
if i remember right the dreamcast is a bit system
the dreamcast system also came out in black sports edition which both versions are cool
the dreamcast was ahead of its time in my opinion
sega implemented the  player ports built into the console like n
sega also did something that nintendo eventually became known for
which is making a controller that seemedseems gimmickey
the controller has a hollowed out midsection which has a port for for a memory car
the n had already had the memory card slot in their controller
however the sega dreamcast controller had a open space which would allow gamers to use a special memory card vmu card
the special memory card had a screen  buttons on it
which would allow you to see things on the screen that wouldnt not appear on your tv screen
for example if you were playing nba k and you slam dunkedthe screen would have a animated reaction to the dunk
the screen would also show you your in game statsect it was a very cool idea
the dreamcast is not a hd system
it has the rf and av capabilities
however a cool thing with dreamcast is that there is a device vga box that allows you to hook up the dreamcast to it  then the vga box to your lcdplasma tvs  it comes in super sharp
you have to buy the vga box seperately  most to my knowledge are not sega brand
i recommend getting itto play dreamcast on the current tvs
the sega dreamcast had many awesome titles to play
some of the best games for this system aremarvel vs capcom   giga wing resident evil  its rareouttriggernba ktony hawks pro skater gta soul caliberplasma swordsonic adventureexpendablesready  rumblesega rallyvirtua fighter crazy taxialso i recommend buying the extension cords for your controllers
its like an extra ft of cordthere are other greatgood games for this system which i cant think of at the moment
if you have yet to own a sega dreamcast but love collecting various systems i recommend getting one
the dreamcast is a classic game system
which is still fun to play to this day
long live sega  all other gamingthe late sega dreamcast was a grand to look at
it was the best sega had ever done and thats saying alot
sega went out with a bang with this masterpiece of a system
this is the first system to also introduce online gaming
thats right the sega dreamcast started with the online
sega was on a role with this game when it first hit stores for about  and the system was worth it
it was just breath of fresh airit first hit stores in the us in september of  and sega was on a role with such titles as sonic adventure and soul calibur but the dreamcast ultimatley fails with not enough sales because of the oh so popular playstation   ps was beating the dc really bad which cause sega to lose lots of sales but sega wouldnt go down with a fight as they bring some of the best games ever to kick the ps out of buisness but with lots and lots of advertising utlimatleythe dreamcast had bin defeated
later some were between the year of  sega announces that they will stop making dc and stop making games for it and become a rd party game teamit was a sad fact but truesega had finally stopped and ps had won but like most reviewers saidpopularitypopularity was the cause of the dreamcast demise
even today with all the games out on playstation  it still doesnt beat dreamcasts feel and wonder of what the games were like
dreamcast may have died but it will still live on as one of the greatest consoles to ever grace the earth
the graphics were ahead of its time and so were the games
the gaming library for dreamcast it just awesome and i can name a few classic must own titlessonic adventurejet grind radiosoul caliburshenmuesword of the berserkchu chu rocketspace channel sonic adventure power stonepower stone and other great dc gamesthe dreamcast will still be one of the best games ever and thats all about itnote  the dreamcast is pretty hard to find now and so are its games so amazon is the best place to find the games  this system is brilliant and plays brilliant games so get it
latesi love the sega dreamcast so much
the dreamcast has online and a gamecube dose not
a dreamcast is easyer
a gamecube is more harder
dreamcast has more better games than gamecube
gamecube is just a copy of a dreamcast
i give a gamecube a  
i give a sega dreamcast a  
i wish they havent stop making games for the dreamcastthe sega dreamcast is the best system ever
ive enjoyed this system from the minute i bought it
ive always been a sega and nintendo fan and mostly against sony from the start and this really does the trick
of course today everyone thinks the ps is the quotdc killerquot not true in any way shape or formsega has the best games
they dont put out games every  minutes like sony they actually think about them before releasing them
they have better racers better action games far better rpgs and sports games completely knock psx into the dirt
graphics are superb and also superior to the ps as well
compare msr to gt  world series k or nfl k to any sports game on ps nba k to nba live  skies of arcadia to any final fantasy etc
this system is underrated just because its not being made anymoreps was hideous from the start
i never thought anything on that was worth the brain cells
awful graphics slow loading times stupid pointless games need i say more
everyone thinks they have all these good rpgs not true
every rpg they have is just a remake of the previous with another number next to it
chrono cross was just final fantasy with a different name same with legend of dragoon
sega has some of the best rpgs ever and theyre all completely different in gameplay and ideas and have better graphics and replayability silver skies of arcadia pso  and  record of lodoss war grandia  soulreaver etc
same with racers theres never been a game on ps as fun as crazy taxi  amp  demolition racer no exit blows away twisted metal and all sega gt tokyo extreme  and  etc
sports is no question
sega has the only online games with better gameplay and graphics
of course sega is smart enough not to have games from  have they ever made even a decent game
and no one has a fighting game that can compare to soulcaliburyes this system isnt given enough credit
ps is not superior at all they have to bite games off sega just to get titles crazy taxi and grandia  ring a bell
i have been most pleased with this system from the start and i am not getting rid of it
i continue to play my games which i have almost  of
i say sega should continue to make games because i love them and long live segaif you truly love games and miss the times when consoles were developed with only gamers in mind then this is your thing
it has countless great games for it
and even the crappy games are charming in their own waythis is a great system and was very sad to see that sega is no longer going to make systems
but have fun with this system while you still can
there really cheap and have a slew of great titles like shenmue sonic adventure house of the dead and many many others
i recommened this even though there are more superior systems
i dont think the online game play is still active but the actual system is awesome
please buy and enjoy this systemthe sega dreamcast was a lot of fun but was hamstrung by a lack of rd party developer support
soul calibur shenmue worms armageddon street fighter but it wasnt enough
capcom was the only rd party developer who seemed to give it an honest chance
the others held out for the playstation its graphics were on par with the ps and the gamecube and it had internet connectivity that made phantasy star online a great adventurehopefully the games library will one day be ported onto the latest generation of systemsmy only complaint is the controller shape is a little wonky
too big and i have big hands like the n and the first xbox
other than that no complaintsits a shame really how not too many people invested in this great system
why didnt people invest
i have a few reasons
games the inital dreamcast games were not all that good except sonic and were greeted with mixed reviews giving the dreamcast little credibility
thus low sales
bitterness  the bitterness between sega and its former fans
these fans were scared off because of segas history of not supporting a system for very long
segas previous system the sega saturn failed due to segas incompetence of supporting the saturn with a large selection of games
mostly because of bad marketing and hardly any third party support
ps  with the upcoming arrival of the playstaion  gamers were saving their  for a ps instead of quotwasting itquot on a dreamcastnow the dreamcast is slowly dying and the company has halted the manufacturing of new dreamcast consoles
sadly there are only somewhere around  more games to be released good ones at that
including titles like nflki have had the pleasure of owning a dreamcast and have played some great games for the console
the graphics on this thing are amazing almost all the games are superb and lots of them are breathtaking nflk sonic hotd ect
in conclusion if a ps is too expensive for you right now is a good time to buy a dreamcast
although the amount new games are becoming fewer and fewer the old ones are selling at great prices
so instead of having a ps and maybe one or two expensive games for it you could own a dreamcast and have manylong live dreamcastokay so youve heard sega has ceased its dreamcast production
youre probably discouraged from buying the dc because you are afraid that there wont be any new games to play in the future
if you think that youre wrong
segas announcement on their permanent halt to producing more dc consoles have actually helped us customers
most important the console price dropped quite affordable to almost everyonesega promises to continue making more games i presume the future sega games will be even better because now sega can focus on producing a great game instead of worrying about how much they are losing profits on the consoles
because sega will be a game maker for not only dc but also for other systems such as psone and  and xbox they will have to be in the competitive market with other software producers sega must not only live up to the standard people are used to seeing and playing ie
nfl k phantasy star online sonic they will have to improve to win an edge over others
it means consumers will see amazing games from sega many of them playable online on dsl modems
the new web browser v 
comes with a useful function where you can talk to anyone in the world who owns a sega with a microphone for free you can call anyone on a telephone for a small pricejust get yourself a dc and a copy of nfl k
i guarantee you will get your moneys worthi own two dreamcasts along with many of its games and since its release in  this system still holds up against all the other modern video gaming console systems
in video gaming there are many intangibles or feelings you get about playing the system that make it an enjoyable experience
sega dreamcast was one of those console gaming systems that set a higher standard for all future video game consoles
it is unfortunate that sega was outmarketed by sony with its much hyped ps because i believe the dreamcast system would still be a solid contender today if sega had the financial strength of a mammoth company like microsoft
today the dreamcast console is seen by many as simply one of the most recent casualties in the increasingly competitive video gaming worldi will never forget the first time i saw the impressive d graphical capabilities of the dreamcast while watching the game soul calibur being played
i remember the stunningly life like visuals in the state of the art sports game nflk
but one of the most memorable moments i ever had was the first time i played nflk and later nflk online using the dreamcast with its built in k modem
i had the dreamcast keyboard plugged in along with the regular game controller and i remember the excitement and awe that we all expressed while we text chatting back and forth with each other between matches
the game play over the k modem was not perfect but overall it was amazingly good
it was the first time that the world experienced any kind of real online console gaming of this type
i knew right then that this online experience eventually would become the future of video gamingthe dreamcast was so far ahead of its time but it is far from being forgotten
after four years of holding out i just recently purchased an xbox and a new slim ps
the xbox is a great system with all the accessories built in like a hard drive ethernet dvd play capability dolby digital  support hdtv widescreen support etc
and i highly recommend it
i especially like the halo   halo  games as well as most of the sports games like nflk
the tiny slim ps is also a great little system and has a massive library of newer ps and the older ps games
i see technologies that were developed for the dreamcast as having been designed into both of these newer console systems like the xboxs dynamic controller and the new pss built in modem and ethernet for online gaming
the dreamcast will be historically remembered  as one of the most significant breakthroughs for console system gaming with its introduction of highly realistic and life like d graphics its super realistic sound quality and for being the first console to support the current presentation of live online gameplay
long live the dreamcast its legacy and its impact on the world of video gamesmy two favorite game systems both had short lives and a great software library partially due to the fantastic imports available from japan and elsewhere
they were also both made by sega
the sega saturn and the sega dreamast
even when the dreamcast was set to launch people feared it wouldnt last long
ultimately they were proved right
sony and nintendo not to mention microsoft were just too big and their advertising too effective
and lets not forget one of the hard and fast rules of commericalism original ideas dont usually make money
lets face it most of the games to come out for these new game systems were copycat versions of previous games dont get me started on the sequel subject just how long do we have before tony hawk  and tomb raider  come out anyway
but unlike the game systems that now ruledreamcast was something differentperhaps the greatest strength of the dreamcast was along its undoing
sega wanted to rule the game market of the future
they invested a fortune in making the dreamcast online capable
every dreamcast came with a builtin modem take that nintendo adn sony
out of the box the dreamcast was internet ready
and the games that were released over the life of the dreamcastman
but like i said original games are slow to be accepted and more than that a lot of the games that were released needed to have the bugs ironed out and the gameplay adjusted
sega was just in too much of a hurry
and as many undoubted know the console world still doesnt seem to be ready to embrace the internet i have never seen anyone play a console game onlinebut if all this is so why does this system deserve five stars
why is it one of my favorite game systems
why do i play it more than my ps
because for everything that sega did wrong they did so much right
take controller ports
the system supports four
that means that the ps version of tennis k supports two players while the dreamast version supports four
but the real kicker isthe dreamcast has more great games for it than any system ever except perhaps the saturn
name any kind of game
sega has something for you
like multiplayer strategy
worms armageddon and worms world party
like fighting games
soul calibur the greatest fighting game ever made
like arcade racing games
sega rally  and hydro thunder both as arcade perfect as it gets
want a shooter
how about the import of ikaruga
how about mars matrix
it goes on and on
the first cellshaded game was on dreamcast jet grind radio
the first d sonic game sonic adventure
not to mention that many great playstation games came out in superior form on dreamcast spiderman hydro thunder worms tomb raider dino crisis ectreally i ask you what more can you want from a game system
you can buy one for less than 
the games set you back  or less in many cases
and a whole heck of a lot of them are better than whats out or coming out for the game systems everyone else is playing
this is truly a game system for the hardcore the master game player the collector and even the person on a budget
im never getting rid of mine
i hope you buy one now and come to the same conclusionsega dreamcast isnt stateoftheart anymore but this was the foundation of our modern game consoles
it introduced complex online gaming
it showed what a d game could really look like
and most important of all it was fun and creative
although it lasted less then a year thanks to stupid ugly sony and their clunky uncreative playstation  in north america it got a lot of crazy games onto the market
sonic adventure is a great game that set the base of who sonic would be in the modern era
yet this time sega didnt stop at sonic
crazy taxi jet grind radio chu chu rocket and a ton of sports games and rpgs all made the dreamcast the place for creativity
not only that dreamcast introduced the vmu a gameboystyle memory card with a monochrome screen that displayed game information and occasionally even let you play games on itin conclusion while dreamcast was short lived in america anyway it introduced a lot of concepts used in todays console and has a lot of fun games
they are more durable then a playstation  but not quite as durable as gamecube and they occasionally have a problem where they dont read discs but i think it is fixable
durability aside it is a great console that sega put their heart into makingi love the dreamcast
but i came to that realization too late in its life cycle
i didnt buy this console until december  as a combination christmas present for myself and my cousins
its unfortunate that shortly after that sega essentially disowned the machine
they are still developing for it but that action had an effect on the development houses outside of sega
thats not to say that everyone but sega is jumping ship thoughthere are a lot of fantastic games that look as good or nearly as good as the ps which i also have
and to be completely honest i enjoy the dreamcast more now because of the wealth of fantastic games it has to offer
in time im sure the ps will catch up and surpass the dreamcast but right now the dreamcast is the machine that offers the most fun for your dollar by farbottom line excellent graphics excellent sound online games and hundreds of excellent titles to choose from for all ages
sega got everything right this time it just happened too late for them to recover what was lost after a series of bad moves
but that doesnt mean we cant benefit and enjoy the fruits of their laborslet me start off by saying that im a huge nintendo fan but that is largly in part because they put out some really great and often historical games
who can forget mario or zelda
or how about the lovable fox mccloud from starfox
these are gaming benchmarks that have now been made with the dreamcast
second off i really think playstation is a good system but lacks what sega and nintendo have
gameplay
most of playstations games are nothing but a big cinematic heap and  minutes of gameplay
with that said i just want to point out that sega is a company that has seen nothing but hardships in there day with nintendo and sony playing the main cards sega has really come to be the fallback system
sega has never really caught my eye until the dreamcast and that is simply because with its technology creators can really push that extra mile to get a game as good as they can get it
shenmue is an example of such a game not to mention soul calibur
while dreamcast maybe the fallback system its a system definatly worth buying since many great games come with this little square box
my hat goes off to sega they stayed in the race for a long time i cant wait to see there next system
its thinkingdreamcast has excellent games that you can now purchase for bargain prices
to name a few  power stone  project justice vanishing point vigilante plus its the single only system that has the year  version of soul caliburfor the price of one xbox system you can purchase  great dreamcast gamesi know this review is just a few years too late but i felt compelled to write it
i cant understand how the dreamcast failed i own a ps xbox and a gamecube and considering the amount of time it was out for it outperformed all of those consoles for classic games
i mainly use my ps now mainly because it has basically full third party support im not interested in performance and specifications just the number of good games available
nintendo are extremely overrated and i consider my gamecube a waste of money and i have a few great xbox games but i wouldnt reccomend it over the dreamcastin just a couple of years the following classics started out on dreamcast  resident evil code veronicavirtua tennis jet set radiometropolis street racershenmue phantasy star onlineskies of arcadiaheadhunterthat is just to name a few and it is more amazing considering that the dreamcast received such little third party support
it just goes to show that if you dont get support from ea and their rubbish sport games which just have a new number on the end every year then a console cant suceed sad but truethe dreamcast is a truely remarkable game system with online support and tons of great games
it is said that by the end of march sega will stop making them and develop only games
if this is the case which it seems to be you best get one now as games like resident evil code veronica any streetfighter you need shenmue grandia  skies of arcadia ecco the dolphin crazy taxi phantasy star online sonic adventure  and  and many many more are excellent games is a date thatll live on forever in the hearts and minds of gamers as it gave birth to one of the greatest game consoles in existence
the dreamcast not only paid homage to the past with its incredible library of arcade titles but it was also a system that pushed the limits and was way ahead of its time
the dreamcast offered crisp and amazing visuals which are even more amazing through vga
in addition to systems technical power it also offered things like the vmu online capabilities etc
the dreamcast was an absolute powerhouse
sadly despite its incredible launch and impressive short lifespan the dreamcast fell victim to the hype from the playstation  instead of buying the dreamcast many decided to hold off and preorder the much anticipated playstation  however despite the playstation s massive game library i believe the dreamcast is the vastly superior systemshenmue

this is just the tip of the icebergthere are still games coming out from independent developers
both gunlord and sturmwind are announced to arrive sometime soonfolks the dreamcast still livesdreamcast is the greatest system too bad it died earlyonly the good die young
see if you can get your hands on one todayfirst of alllet me say this is a great system
now lets go to the good stuffcontrollersexcellent
they are well designed and have a anolog stick or dpad choiceplenty of buttons in convenient positions plus to on the back
basically a cross between the n and xbox controllers
gameswho cares if it doesnt have as many games as playstation
its got plenty of good titles that it does havesonic adventure  wheelerand demolition racer to name just a few
tee off isnt as good as mario golf for the nbut it is still good
alsosonic adventure has something sa doesnt haveadventure boards
although this can make the game frusturating at timesit is still cool
okayso maybe these are the only games ive played for dc other than sonic shufflewhich i hate and is nowhere close to mario party but they are still good and ive also played wacky raceswhich is a very fun and cool racing gamebut is kind of fursturating at times
another cool thing is the web browser which is compatible with the dc keyboard and mouseand version  of it even comes with a simple yet cool game called sega swirl
now as for the memory cardstheres not much to say other than that they can hold plenty of info and are at a reasonable price
multiplayer capablitythis system has almost as good as multiplayer as pcbecause it has plenty of good multiplayer games plus you can play on the internet and it comes with  controller ports
graphicsthey might be a bit under that of playstation nintendo gamecubexboxor a new pcbut they are still quite amazing especially for their timethe game ive played that i think has the best graphics is sonic adventure 
pricingamazing
this console a lot cheaper than ps oneyet it is even better
plus it has the feature that was first introduced on ps onethe ability to play music cds
but the cd playback isnt as good as other systems though
to sum it upthis is a great system with quality gamesaccessoriesinternetand multiplayer capablities
it may have been the first bit systembut in some gamers eyesit is the bestbut i still no ps and gc are betteri have always been a sega fan
through genesis right up to this
lets just say that i am so very happy that i came along this
now i see that there is a war of gaming systems and every one is confused on which one to buy  ps or a dreamcast
i for one have played both  a few weeks ago my cousin had rented a ps
he called me about it saying how great and grand it was and i was curious in seeing it
i got there and played it and was dissapointed
there is nothing new
you look at madden  and nflk and you cant even tell them apart
ps launch titles were just dumb games trying to showcase how great ps is
none of them made any sense
so i turned and looked deeper into the dreamcast
i became more and more obsessed with it
games like shenmue resident evil code veronica blow ps out of the water
just save your money and get a dreamcastthat sort of sums it upyep dont fall for the ps hype and the glitchy dvd player   dollars more than a dreamcast
step right up and get a taste of what real videogaming is like
this system has the power the library and the price
if you are looking for more you wont find it
games to try sonic  adventure and crazy taxi  around xmas these games will be  as  well while ps games that are inferior will be  can i make it any  clearerthe sega dreamcast was segas last console before they got out of the console buisinessthe games are amazing the graphics are amazing as well
the vmu is the memory card
like the original xbox the memory card plugs into your controller
at the front of the controller there is a hole
when you put the memory card in the first slot on your controller
it will looks like your controller has a screen on it
sadly like the gameboy the vmu only has  color
the controller feels comfortable in your hand
the analog stick can be a little wobbly at times
you can also take your vmu anywhere you go
and play some little games on it like you did on the pocket stationmy brother and ibought a dreamcast last two week ago because of the price went downso when we hook it up the console the first game we got was superroundabout san francisco edition and street fighter  double impactthe  bit graphic look amazingis a bright sharp graphic we ever seendreamcast graphic look better then n we own and the best thing about this console that is smallis amazing this little console can do like you can use has a internet which million of people know already and a cd audio toois sad to hear that sega is not making anymore dreamcast this year because ps is a top sellerbut i hope the game maker like capcomeidosactivision and other company that support dreamcast still make more game this yearwhy we buy this console that we know sega is not making dreamcast console anymore instead we didnt buy playstation that why we pick dreamcast because the price is good and its little bit same has ps which dreamcast doesnt have dvd compatible but is still a great console
quotbuy one if you likequotdont let being a casual gamer fool you into not buying the dreamcast because its development will stop on march  
that has nothing to do with the  games that are still coming out for it
by  dreamcast should have  games
i have played my dreamcast over  hours and have not one regret of my purchase
ive also got one of my teachers to buy a dreamcast from my strong recommendation
he really loves playing it and thanked my personally for helping him decide on whether or not to get one
if you want to play multiplayer games dreamcast is your best bet
the builtin modem is secondtonone in terms of being a great idea
online gaming is here and dreamcast is best
my recommendations for online games are phantasy star online nfl k nba k quake iii arena speed devils online and chu chu rocket
my offline recommendations are sonic adventure shenmue resident evil code veronica rayman  soul calibur test drive le mans samba de amigo seaman gundam side story crazy taxi etc etc etc
dreamcast has the best lineup of games i cant list all of them
about  of every  dreamcast games is a badegg
almost hard to not find a good one
for the love of gaming pick one updc bitsvery comfortable controller controller ports
very many games allow up to  playersall games on both the psx and dc are better on dcsame goes for some dc games on psonline gamepayk modem upgradeable to dslcablet blocks of memory on vmusmini games to play and download on visual memory unitsover  gamesi can go on and on and on and ongames availablemarvel vs capcom  and doanba nhl nfl k k and kcrazy taxi  and shenmuecapcom vs snk  and japanese import version of soul caliburall street fighter sstreet fighter alpha  games shown here only  of which appear on ps and  on psxbottom line the one and only sega dreamcast rules
please listen to me and all others who gave it a  star rating
id even give it  if it were possiblei have always been into video games
i was looking forward to buying one of the new systems when one night my mom came home and on the table she put down two controllerstwo games and two memory cards
i asked her why she bought all that stuff and she told me that she got it for an amazingly low price
she thought that it would be a great gift for someone that had the console
then she allowed me to take one controller out of the box and hold it
i was stunned by how comfortable it was
so then i looked at the box and it said for use with the sega dreamcast on it
so then i started to wonder if the dreamcast is good
after doing some research i decided that the dreamcast was very cheap but well worth the money
so i decided to get a dreamcast instead of one of the new systems and i save a couple of hundred bucksnow lets take a closer look at the controllerwhen you first look at the controller it might seem like the weirdest thing ever
in a good way
when you pick it up and grab it it feels perfect
it does not only feel perfect but it is perfect
to this day i have not found a single flaw with the controller
the buttons are perfectly positioned
the controller is simple and yet not too simple
unlike the ps controller
the analog thumb pad is in the right spot and so are the analog thumb triggerson the bottom of the controller is a little slot that you can stick the cable in so it is not in the way
the controller also has two slots in the bach fer a visual memory unit and a jump pack
in the front of the controller is a hole so you can see the screen of the vmu which displays graphics according to whatever game you are playing
the plug fits easily into the controller port
like i already said that this is a very good deal
you should get a couple of extras before they are all sold outoverall this is the best controller i have ever usedif my mom wouldnt have gotten this controller then i propabply wouldnt have a dreamcast and i wouldnt have written this reviewi hope that this helped you outat first when i saw the dreamcast controller i was likequotit looks kinda weirdquot but after i bought the dreamcast played games on it i was like quothey
i dont need to shake my hand off with this thingquot my point is the dreamcast controller doesnt hurt ur two pointing fingers like the playstation and super nintendo controller do
i can play with the dc controller for hours
whoever made this controller was brilliantbut if u are used to playing playstation the buttons are totally opposite the a button where u would think the x button is so u got to get used to the buttons first took me about  daysim so happy these are still available brand new in the box and at a great price
i just recently bought a dreamcast
i wanted one badly when they first came out but went with a playstation instead
looking forward to playing a few games nowthis remote was revolutionary for its time
it brought me back in time when i started using it
the controller i received was the european version but it still functioned with my systema lot of people thought that this controller was way to big and that it wasnt good
but me i thought differently
i thought it was a pretty unique controller in its own form
kind of big yes it is but it still has a great feel to it
like the vmu slot to the opening in the middle so you can see the screen
great controllerok so the controller is pretty blucky but if you are a true gamer and have a japanese import of camcom vs snk  millionare fighting mark of the millenium  in the usa then you will deffinetly play it and you will get used to it plus when this console has some of the best games for the cheapest price then you will get used to it infact you will want to get used to it badlythe playstation playstation and gamecube use memory cards to hold the data of a saved game but dreamcast went one step further with the visual memory unit or vmu for short
rather than just a memory card saved games could unlock minigames and the units screen also show in game features such as health condition for gamesthe visual memory unit is for segas dreamcast game console and connected to the systems controller to interface with games
it was a truly innovative but underutilized accessory by game developers who used it to simply save data which it did wonderfully
the vmu was more than a glorified memory card it was something that could easily enhance any game if only a little extra time was invested into the overall product
unfortunately only a modest handful dreamcast titles took advantage the vmu like jet grind radio power stone shenmue and street fighter alpha  among others that added extra features or mini games
the visual memory unit design resembles a miniaturized version of nintendos original gameboy
the lcd screen is placed above the dpad and other buttons which are situated close together but the whole unit fits nicely in the palm of your hand
even though the  blocks of memory on the vmu is enough to store numerous average sized save files it leaves very little room when saving games like segas classic k sports series that require more space
perhaps because of the modest storage size but files arent prone to being corrupted even after nearly a decade
overall the visual memory unit is a necessity for any dreamcast owner but id highly recommend purchasing a spare as a backup units can even interlock to exchange files
beware though the vmu drains batteries at an alarming rate but time sure does fly when your having fungreat item and i love the visual memory unit because its the first  visual memory card too d d dthe sega vmu is simply amazing
it is not just a memory card but it also shows the last time you used your game a clock and games that you can download of sega net
it also has a great lcd screen which you can use to choose your plays in football games so your friends dont cheat
the only problem is the battery power is weak and it the vmu only holds  blocks which is just enough to save one sega sports k
the sega vmu is still a great deali had one of these when i was a kid but for what ever reason it went missing
for as long as i kept playing my dreamcast i could never save my games
now i decided to find one so i can relive my childhood with this and it looks and works exactly how i remember it from way back whenlike many other reviewers have stated the battery life on this unit is very short
but other than that this memory card is the best you will find
have at least one or two of these on hand
why you ask
play any of the sega sports titles and you will find out
happy gaming and go soonerstrust sega to take something simple as a memory card and transform it into an awesome accessory that does more than that
the vmu saves data and downloads small games which can be played on its selfcontained screen and controls
theyre abundant and very cheap making for one of the easiest consoles to get memory cards for
it just doesnt get much cooler than thisfirst off this is not the only color of the memory cards
there are many colors
you can save games onto this from dreamcast games
it works as a clock
you can manage and copy files and the connector things on the end allow you to connect it to another vmu
its great
trust meand now the drawbacks minigames take up loads of space  copying files to other vmus without using the dreamcast is slow  the standard color is dullexcept for the  drawbacks i mentioned this is worth every penny that you spendits a nongeneric memory cardconsidering past memory cards for past systems may not have had all the memory one could have hoped for sega decided to change things up when they released the dreamcast
the dreamcast vmu visual memory unit is a step ahead in designing home system memory cards
included is a small lcd screen with working buttons to play minigames along with other features for example raising chaos in sonic adventure or playing a pacman type game with namco museum
you can take the top off the vmu and transfer files into another vmu or link it up to play minigames together
the vmu can hold up to  blocks of memory and while this may seem like a lot most of segas k sports titles take just about  blocks of memory just to save options let alone a team season
not to mention that after a while the battery life of the vmu lcd screen will die and that happens quicker than expected but the lcd screen isnt necessarily needed if your just using the vmu as a memory card and nothing more
all in all i would recommend at least  or  vmus for dreamcast owners theyre cheap and affordable and you can still find them at game retailersim gonna make this short and sweet for youyou got a dreamcastget this
it will obvioulsy save some of the biggest and baddest dc games around
too far in soul calibur
had enough skatin and doin some nice graffiti in jet grind radiosave itdreamcast rulesbuy it and buy the vmulatesthe idea of having a memory card that can also douple up as a mini game itself is very clever
the vmu will save you data and also gives you the facility to exchange data with a friend by conecting the two vmus together
the vmu is also a clock the vmu also turns into a miny game
the mini game works depending on what information is saved
for instance if you had power stone and complete the game with different characters you are awarded a prize one of the prizes is a mini fruit machine to play on the vmu
if you had sonic you can gain a little cyber pet type creature which you raise on the vmu to help your progress on the actual game
so overall sega have come up with one fancy gadgetfor me the vmu just saves games and displays useful information to me in the controller window for certain games
and those tasks it does a fine job at
you just have to have one of these for each controller that gets used on a regular basis
the display is what cinches it because frankly they dont have enough memory on their own
nflk alone will chew up one of these guys if you play a seasoni use  controllers often so i bought   for regular saves i bought one of the  page jobbies that quadruple the storage of these in the same amount of space
i just slap that one in the first controllers second port
theres no display on the larger memoried one
but that does mean i forsake the use of the vibrating gizmos
but since ive never tried one on the dc i dont feel like im missing anythingthe price is steep but i prefer getting it from sega than someone else
had they produced one of the modules that stores more like the others id have gotten that from sega as wellyou cant go wrong with having this with the dreamcast
just a memory card pretty much with a screen
good stufflove live the dreamcastgreat game
this game made me so unboard during the summer of 
the graphics are ok
but tekken  is going to be better
this game is you are trying to be the winner of the iron fist tournament  or something like that
great game overallok i am going to start off by saying as you might have guessed from the title ive played this brilliant game in the arcade not on the playstation
but then again who cares
its the same game and its equally fun
this is among the best fighting games ive ever played
i love it i love it i love it
so many cool characters are in this game including nearly all of my top  favorite heroes and villains as well as the bestand onlyneutral fighter here yoshimitsu
anyway here it goes
this game is about trying to protect the world from a soul eating ogre
on to the pros and consprosthe fighters are wonderfully made  if you know how to use them real ass kickersmy favorite tekken heroking half jaguar half man all wrestlerfavorite tekken neutralityyoshimitsu half machine half man all warriorand favorite tekken villain nina williams half hottie half scorned woman all assassinare featured here
yep you got it
the top  coolest fightersin my opinionall get a great role in this gameyou can see bursts of energy and blood coming out whenever you hit your opponentthe sound effects music and noises the characters make are damn near perfectthe graphics while id prefer them d not d are still very good for a game that was made in the s and i would never want them taken away for that reasonthere are a lot of other great fighters too such as gun jackhes really powerful and his only weakness is not being too fastand there are fighters even better than he such as jin kazama and paul phoenixwho by the way are both among my favorites they rock so much
and hwoarang whos not as good as gun jack but still rocks bigthe final boss ogretrue ogrei count him as two villainslooks to be very powerful and very difficult to defeat but theres a special trick to defeat him as though you were teaching a tired cat to yawn you just gotta play as king and kick the s out of him
trust me ive done it twice
you fight ogre as king hes got no hope
periodthere is a very cool gold and lightning backround surrounding the red sign that will say you are the champion if you win the game
not to mention the credits will give you a free replay of your victories against your opponents  how you defeated themfinally for the last pro other cool characters than the ones mentioned are herethey are not as cool as king yoshimitsu nina jin bryan fury whos also here paul gun jack heihachi mishima the second to last boss hwoarang kazuya mishima here without first mention or lei wulong who also is here without the first mention but they still really really rock and i love them all they include anna willaims a great villain who not only is better than ogre but also ninas sister julia chang a good looking woman and a skilled fighter but she really has got to do something about her hair eddy gordo a really cool cent like hero who dresses in yellow  green forest law brother of the awesome marshall law who hes just as fast  skilled as kuma a cool looking grizzly bear fighter who really knows how to bring down the houseliterallyand panda her brother is kuma and she is cute if not a little bit of a softie
oh well shes a pretty decent fighter if you know how to use her
nuff saidconsthe only con is that so far there is only one tekken game better than this onethe fabulous tekken  dont know how ill judge tekken  but whatever
this game is absolutely flawless and for now only the tekken  coming after it is better
periodall in all this is a game you must have if you like tekken or if you just plain like to play cool beatemup games
i recommend this to all people with one or both of those traits
ps
the only beatemup game better than tekken is mortal kombat
my name is alex k catman for my love of lions tigers jaguars and all other cool animals cats or otherwisehave a nice day
and if you got the money buy the gamethe tekken games have always been the most popular fighters for the ps
tekken was very blocky bad character details and did not move very smoothly
however it still had fun game play and unlike the other tekkens it offered great challenges and moves that were always fun to learn
then tekken came out and was a vast improvement over the first
it had more moves and combo systems better graphics and new characters
then tekken the best tekken and the best fighter for the ps
it features many new characters lots of moves and combo systems
good smooth graphics and nice looking fmv sequences
new modes such as tekken force a very fun side scrolling game similar to the old nes game double dragon
a very addictive and fun minigame called tekken ball mode play it with some friends its a blast
also all the normal modes such as survival arcade and time trial are all there
as for the difficulty of the game it of course features three modes easy normal and hard
i was though very surprised with the challenge of arcade mode
but the boss ogre was way to easy and even his second form was easier than his first
my favorite characters are yoshimistu sp
 jin kuzama and bryan fury
as for the replay value it kept me playing it for a week or two and thats pretty good
i have not yet played ttt tekken tag tournament but i will soon
plus i am very excited about tekken  so if you want a hardcore action packed fighting game that is very realistic they even considered gravity so they jump the normal height then i highly suggest this game to you
its the bestthis game can really make a bad day go good
as one of the best  games for the playstation that i have i can say im impressed
i am not very good at it but a challenge always brightens me up
i dont like tekken force mode a sidescrolling thingy where you fight soldiers with strange names like hawk
i think i like arcade mode the best where you fight fight fight
really great game
i havent tried the other tekken games but im sure that there wont be any other game of this series that can beat this dang fighting game
i bet nothing will stand up to this game that i like to call the fighting game kingtekken  may not look like much more than another d fighterbut believe meit is very different from the previous tekken games and other fighting gamesthis is a huge improvement over tekken  amp the gameplay is addictive and never gets tiresomeplus the controls are perfectit has tons of fighting moves and combos which never get repeativeplusit has many great charecters each with their own unique stylesits also a great multiplayer game to bootbuy this gamei have been playing tekken  for a long long time and its just as fun now as it was when i first bought it
its a wonderful game to play alone and even better when played with a friend
its my favorite fighting game on the playstation or on any console of its generation for that matterpresentation tekken s menus and loading screens are very similar to those of their arcade counterpart and although not particularly amazing graphically somehow manage to look very stylish
theyre a perect example of grace through simplicitygraphics wow
i do not think that it is possible for the playstation to generate graphics better than these
the character models are detailed and very wellconstructed and the beautiful textures that cover them smooth them out and make the fighters much more realisticlooking
unlike in tekken  you seldom see the facets of the character models when they move
the backgrounds are much more detailed than those of the last game and have been almost seamlessly blended with the floors of the games many arenas
namco seems to have pushed the system beyond what it was once believed to be capable of and the only way for the game to be improved upon would be to move it up to a more powerful console ie
tekken tag tournament and tekken  on the playstation 
beautiful
and of course the cg cutscenes have to be seen to be believedsound this game has the best sound effects of any fighting game on the system methinks
the punches and kicks and battlecries are full of energy and vigor and differ depending on who and what has been attacked by whom
the music is neat too but thats really a matter of personal taste
ive laways enjoyed playing to it and namco has included both the original arcade music and a new remixed music set made especially for the psx version
good stuffgameplay of course this is the most important aspect of any game
fortunately tekken  scores high in this area
it is a game that you can sit down and play and have fun with from the moment you put it into your playstation but which you can be challenged by even after you have become very skilled
tekken  has a large cast of characters all of whom fight in their own unique styles
most players will have a favorite but these favorites tend to differ from person to person
the characters over half of whom need to be unlocked by completing various challenges are very well balanced and none of them not even the final bosses feel disproportionately weak or strong in comparison to the others
tekkens classic button system makes for a smooth effective control system that is easy to adjust to and allows for a vast library of moves for each character and if you want you can fully customize the controls to suit your own style
there are many modes of play including story mode vs mode a sidescrolling batemup mode and a tekken ball mode
you can also unlock a theater in which to play the movies and music that you unlock
you can even use the theater to play movies and music from tekken  and  if you have them
the actual fighting is great
the characters movements are fluid and widely varied and each and every fight is different
the game includes a full list of all the moves and combos for each character but there are still secret moves hidden here and there
and there are more moves than just attacks and blocks
handsprings rolls cartwheels flips and kipups are just  few of the things that characters do
especially interesting are fighting styles such as eddies capoeira and yoshimitsus um unique methods
the possibilities just go on and onall in all this is a fun and deeply engrossing game
if you want the best fighter on the psx give it a trygraphics   the characters can be a bit seethrough but the backdrops are fabulous and its extremely clear when youve done a judo chop to someonesound   great fist fighting realistic sounds and cool music brings tekken  blazingly alive in the sound areavalue   do not read this review further if you have not yet played bought or borrowed tekken  it is well worth the money and youll play it for ages
not a game you get sick of easilyoverall   lots of things to do lots of martial arts moves to learn heaps of blood a barrel of fun  tekken  is one of the most entertaining overall amazing playstation games to come out in a long timetekken  is the best fighting game i have ever played
if you loved tekken than you have to play tekken 
my cousin has tekken and i liked it alot so i bought tekken  let me say tekken  is  times better than tekken
it has alot of new and old charactersor alot of characterslike lawkingninajin whoarangxiaoyueddypaulleiand yoshimitsu
it has a ton of characters that you can unlock if you beat arcade mode like mokujinogretrue ogreheihachikumaor pandajuliabryanannaand gun jack
you get up immediatly from falls
it has alot of modes like arcade tekken force where you walk along and beat people up and face a boss practice and more
i unlocked all the characters and unlocked a new mode called tekken ball mode where you play volleyball and if you dont hit it back to the other guy your life gets reduced
and theres new fighting styles so buy this game youll be glad you didthis game is pretty much the ultimate when it comes to fighting
the only thing it lacks is the use of weapons and magic
still the amount of moves the game actually has is mindboggling
i would be totally surprised if there were anyone on the planet who knew every move of every player
theres just too damn many
ive played many a fightin games streetfighter mortal kombat killer instinct etc
im not exactly the greatest gamer around but i know when a game has just too many moves to choose from
i would quotguesstimatequot that each player in this game has roughly seventy or more possible combos moves special moves etc
that they can throw at you
thats just too many moves
if you are an amateur you want to play this game first
the lessons you learn from controlling the characters of this game can be applied to any other fighting gameguaranteedi first played this game in the s when i was  years old and i loved it then and still do today
the graphics were wonderful for the s and the game is very enjoyable and fun
the characters have such personality it is like they are real
i recommend this game to any gamer that likes classic s games
this game rulesit all starts here well it was here where i truly fell in love with tekken
i love t but t was quotholy cowquot moves and graphics
for those that are starting with tekkenthis game should be your firstive had tekken  for two years now and i still love playing it mainly because it is one of the best ps fighters ever madereasons why this is a great game are simplethere are tons of great characters from yoshimitsu the ever cute dragon gon the sexy schoolgirl ling xiaoyu and over a dozen more
the wonderful part is they all have their own unique fighting styles which keeps the action from getting dullwith mulitple game modes this also adds to tekkens variety and level of fun
tekken force mode puts the characters into a side scrolling action game
although my fave is tekken ball which is a wierd mix of fighting and volleyball
i know what youre thinking but trust me its funthe game is a little hard at first but give it a week or so and you will get it down pactwith all the unlockable characters modes and costumes it will keep you entertained for weeks to come
that and being one of the most comprehensive fighters out there makes it a must havevery happy with this purchase another one of those games you can play for hours
great price and great condition of item
definately exceeded my expectations with price quality and availabilityi first played this game at an arcade at a ski lodgei didnt go skiing that afternooni immediately purchased it after i got my ps and it captured me
i must say it is a fine piece of martial arts work
totally get this game or at least try it
it is a great improvement from its predecessors
if you didnt like those  just loooook at thiiiiis
it is niiiiiiiiice
try iiiiiiiiti love this game i have ever since it came out
the characters are great and classic
ever since i was young i have been in love with the tekken series
brings back a lot of good memories
i bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun
though the graphics arent as top notch at games these days are but its still an entertaining game to play
if you collect either tekken stuff or video games this is a must own
dont miss out on this game before you know it it will be gonebam bam boom
tekken  has great graphics awsome moves and best of all awsome challangesi played this game when i was younger
i bought it so i could play it again
i miss these old ps gamestekken  is the best d fighting game on the playstation
the only game that comes close to tekken  is soul blade
the graphics on this playstation version suffer a little from the translation but the gameplay is faithfully intact
there are plently of fighters to play as from the start and even more to earn as you beat the game multiple times
the only feature which may sour gamers experiances with this game is the unbalanced play control of a few of the characters
even though every character has a few high damaging moves of their own eddy gordo and hwoarang are easily the cheapest characters in the game
a simple button mashing on the kick buttons with these characters can send them into a fury of kicks that can kill an opponent in just a few hits
this is very frustrating when youve spent time practicing complex combos only for someone to come along and get the same results by just mashing on buttons at random
although with experience one can learn to block and counter those moves so its not too big of a problem if you practice
aside from that tekken  is near flawless
i highly recommend it to anyone who has a playstationoh is this game good or what
it is only the best fighting game ever made
even better then the ps tekkens tekken tag and tekken 
the graphics are good and the movies are great
the sound is good also
i love the characters and the stages
the best thing about it is that the graphics arnt as slow as  and  besides that the fighting style to every character is great
if this is what all fighting games are like i want them allafter a friend lent me this game  i was totally hooked 
i went right out and bought it  as well as  tekken   
every character has their own unique fighting style  and the combos are not hard to master at all 
plus there are many different modes of game play to choose from 
as well as new costumes and characters to unlock 
and its fast paced too 
just like soulblade 
so if you want a great game  reasonably priced  that ll have you playing for hours on end  then go out and get it 
even if its the only fighting game you get 
and also get  soulblade  and  tekken tag team  for the ps

you have to love it
in my opinion the  player mode is the best we were playing in teams of the main point of the game is to use different moves using the playstation controller to destroy your opponentthe characters i liked the best were gon jin and law
gon is great because hes small and the taller characters kicking or punching always misses
jin is strong overall and my friends nephew said that hes the best person in the game if you know how to control him
i can control him well and demolished my opponent in  seconds we were using the  second time limit in the  player mode
law is a great kungfu type of fighter and he kicks well
its fun plotting the same kind of characters against each other  like gon against gon or jin against jinthe other characters not in the main lineup are good too  we got doctor
b in our game  but hes annoying because he keeps falling over  but he has some good movesthe theatre mode is funny too  watching all the short videos on each character  my favourites were xiaoquai spelling
 jerk that tree guy cant remember his name bryan and jinalso a good laugh is the ball mode  which is like volleyball except youre trying to take away each others healthi havent played all the modes yet but im sure i will soonyou have to buy this game if you liked tekken or tekken  or if you like classic games like streetfighter or like fighting games
fantasticthis game is the best instalment in the franchise
with many more characters added and more in depth story modes
this game has everything
in my opinion itcan compete with any modern fighting game todayone might see this game as a diablo clone and it very well may be but it is deeper and more fun than the original diablo in many ways
first of all the graphics are all d which is a step that even diablo  has not taken
the quests are a little more random and nonlinear than in either diablo making it very replayable
one great feature is the way one player can create two heroes  one to control directly and the other to be controlled by the computer as a monsterkilling ally
in addition to this the d levels have great lighting effects and fighting monsters is really funthere are  main classes which are divided into  subclasses according to gender which has a small effect on the characters for example females can be archers but males can be assassins
there are  skills that each character can learn and improve upon and these skills are different for different classes
also characters get hungry and must be fed with food bought from the store found during adventuring or found using special skillsi bought the game for  and was satisfied
i highly reccommend it for the new amazoncom price or if you can find it at a pc game store for cheaperwell  to say that nightstone is graphically subpar to todays actrpgswould be a completely unfair and also a idiotic comparisonwhat you have here is a game that was created during the changing of thegaurd between win and xp  high tech graphic engines did not exist as of this time and d graphics were still in its infantcyok with that aside i find nightstone to be a very enjoyable titlei was suprised to see that for an old title the developers got the wholecontrol scheme and camera control down to a science very easy to pick upand play without tedium and the option to play  characters at once andswitch between them with ease is something i dont see in even most oftodays multimillion dollar titles
game developerstake note want tocreate a title that works buy a copy of this game study the animationsthe control scheme and use todays graphic resources and then maybejustmaybe fans of the genre will get something worth the story is only slightly original but for what its worth it worksand it does seem to rival most the dribble thrown in most modern rpgsof this type
 stars for getting right back then what most should have already perfected by nowholyknighti hesitated to purchase this title because of the previous poor review
i am truly sorry because this game quotrocksquot  the opponents have personalities and adaptable driving styles
they actually try to cut you  off and try to prevent you from passing
heads turn to look at you and the  smooth framerate pulls you into the action
the graphics are fantastic and  the sheer inventory of cars to choose from is amazing
gameplay is  enjoyable and the ability to race against your opponent and win his car  makes this the my racing sim of choice
many times i have found myself  blurting out the words quotyou are walking hom from this onequot after  entering the final stretch of quothigh stakesquot  running on a  piii with mb ram rpm ata voodoo  soundblaster live at  x using an ms sidewinder there are no hesitations or  quotcyberburpsquot in any way
i have not encountered any problems  except understeering conditions which since i have never really driven the  cars in question cannot be contributed to the game
the incorporation of  the previous tracks along with the new will please the veteran nfs fan as  well as challenge themthey only picked the tricky ones
i was lucky to  pick this game up for  in the markdown bin and would have paid more  if i had driven a demo prior to release
this game is a must have if you  have the hardware to fully enjoy it and if not it will look okay but must  be run at lower resolutionsas of now this game in my opinion is the best racing game outnfs has had the best racing car simulaters out
the th addition to this amazing series is probably the best
it has a wide variety of companies  and their vehicles such as ferrari porsche lamborghini and even  maclaren
the tracks are far beyond any other with great scenery and  sound effects
you can race in countries like usa canada germany  france and the ukthe hot pursuit option is very good with the lighting  effects and the different looking cop cars
each country has their exact  looking kind of police vehicle and the way their sirens soundalso the  new option in this game is the high stakes option which allows you to beef  up your own cars then play against other people with them
if you win you  get to keep your opponents car
if you lose well im sure you can guess  what happenswhat do i look for in a car game
speed room for error exhilaration and cars  lots of them
there have been many great driving games this year but the one that really does put you back in your seat is nfs rc
the tracks  and cars are radiant and the different modes of play give enough lasting  appeal
career mode and car damage are improvements over nfs but there  could have been more tracks buts thats being picky
want a laugh
midtown  madness
want rally
colin mcrae
want touring
toca  if ever you need to  get in your ferrari on a sunday afternoon and go mph down a county lane  you wont find a better sim then this
adrenalin rush for the fastest drive  of your lifei had need for speed   and high stakes and all were fun liked the music and gamplay in high stakes graphics could have been better though but other wise a good game
if you are into racing classics then this is the game to geti dont know what the problem is for the other people
i have a  mhz pii w megs of ram and a voodoo   mb graphics card
the thing runs great
the framerates are excellent at x
if i run it in x  then it gets choppy if it is raining or snowing
nothing new there
too  much oversteer on the cars
i dont think so
i have slid my real car on  dry pavement and its about the same
 contour   g skidpad i  personally think the game kicks some butt
i think that there is a  hardware compatibility problem for the other people
you need the most up  to date glide drivers you can get
just an opinion
by the way i have  nfs and  so this is old news for me
you have to have a proportional  input device for steering or you will do very poor however you can use  the keyboard for the accelerator
you just have to be more careful  because its either on or offthis is by far the best darn game i have played
great game play and some killer graphics that go way beyond anything you can find
the internet play is great and neraly lag free due to the optimized code
this game did  the best job of going way beyond the first two games
the material  defender just got upgraded and it is worth every penny to buy this great  gamei have played descent since it first appeared and in a time when everyone else was content to produce firstperson view games where your opponents were little more than secondrate scaled bitmaps descent gave the player  an opportunity to combat real three dimensional foes in all three  dimensions
plus the foesinsane robots driven mad by an alien virus moved  like nothing else and seemed intelligent
there was nothing else like it  on the market yet somehow it missed the vein and people flocked to games  like doom amp doom ii
when descent ii appeared in  i thought for  sure that the game would take off but it didnt happen
however it wasnt  about to stop me from enjoying a terrific game
now we have arrived to this  place and once again interplay has unleashed a new descent and one that  takes full advantage of d cards and more powerful computersdescent iii also features a new game engine known as fusion that enables  the player to move from the familiar mines of the post terran mining  corporation out to the planets surface and surrounding environments
i  guess this is hard to do in this sort of game
additionally they have  improved the ai and it really shows in the way the robots behave and  there is a significant increase danger to your ship in combat
the robots  are all new and feature more polygons and detailed texture mapping than  every before
additionally d acceleration is probably the best i have  ever seen in any game
descent  uses more dynamic light effects than any  game i have ever seen
in fact it is so graphically intensive it is one  of the reasons why i upgraded my  mhz to an athlon  the demo ran  fine on my old system but when i bought the full version even when i  turned off all of the special effects it barely ran
i would recommend at  least pii  as does interplayd provides much of the same kind  of game play as its other incarnations its just better
i have friends  who cannot play the game because they get disoriented too easily when  working in the three dimensions of the mines
however if youre like me  you get a certain thrill from the constant direction changes as you blast  away at nasty robots with impunity
d offers a new spread of weapons  including frag missiles that burst apart in a shower of miniprojectiles  impact mortar which create very large localized explosions and heaps of  damage the vauss cannon which is an updated variant of my favorite gauss  cannon
gone are the earth shaker missiles replaced now with the black  shark a singularity weapon which turns hunting bots into a skeet shoot
basically there are enough weapons to make your average nra lobbyist drool  with envyof course none of this means a tinkers cuss if its no  fun to play right
well get ready cause youre going downagainthe pace of the game is much faster than the original thanks mostly due to  the quicker response and aggressiveness of the robots
it is here you will  see the improved ai in action because the robots will come after you will  work in teams they do not cluster together to make masskills easier and  at higher skill settings they most certainly will take you apart
the rush  is incredible when youre fighting like mad in the early levels just to  stay alive
the napalmequipped bots are ferocious and stick to you like  their weapons do
the robot generator areasthe ones that replicate new  attack bots keeps churning them out as fast as you can shoot them down
the game can be relentless at times which is what a player wantsnow as for the story you play the material defender ptmcs itinerant  mercenary from the previous two games and who went mia at the end of d  thanks to a defective jump drive
after you are rescued by a rebel faction  on mars who wants to expose ptmc and their evil ceo dravis as being  responsible for the alien virus spreading to ptmcs robots and facilities
it becomes allout battle against ptmc who like all rich corporations  have their own squadrons of pyro gx fighters and start coming after you
see and you thought big companies just didnt care about the little people  anymorethe only place where d suffers is the ingame music
its  boring lifeless and worse it sounds like the music we listened to in  computer games a decade ago
that is also not to say ds skinny puppy or  type o negative was any better i guess because it was an industrial  setting a mine they assumed that wed want to hear industrial music
wrong
and i like industrial
i found myself turning the music off and  reaching for a star wars soundtrack to plop in my cd player to accompany  the game
beyond that i have little to complain about
this is a top notch  game as far as game play visuals and sound effects are concerned
its got  a break neck pace at times while at others its slowpaced which can get  really creepy until the first robot jumps you and you wet your undies in  shockthe descent series have always been my favorite first person  shooter along with jedi knight and d does not disappoint in any way
the visuals and fmv cut scenes are stunning and the sound is excellent
i  highly recommend for anyone so equipped with environment audio on their  sound card to use the full four speaker set up because d was produced and  recorded in dolby surround and it just adds so much to the experience
youll also need a death machine of a system to run itback in  the third and most likely final chapter of the descent series released
it was praised and lauded by game reviewers and magazines worldwide
however due to interplays bungled marketing the game never got the player recognition it deserved
tragically it meant the end for the seriesi think it speaks volumes about a game when i can look at it now three years later and see what i see
people are still building new levels for it multiplayer is still fairly popular and the community is still strong
the descentbb and planet descent are great places to start so look them up when you get the chanceanyhow regarding the game itself
the hallmark of the descent series is its gameplay that concerns all three axes of movement unlike other fps games like quake or unreal that largely limit your movement to the ground
in descent you can fly wherever you want to stop and turn on a dime and move freely
descent  continues this with its new game engine which actually consists of two engines  one for rendering indoor areas and the other for rendering outdoor areas with terraincontinuing where descent  left off the game reprises your role as the material defender a mercenary hired by the postterran minerals corporation sent to rid their intergalactic mining installations of worker robots gone amuck
as fate would have it rather than pay you for your efforts your boss at the ptmc named dravis decided to sabotage your ship instead
fortunately before reaching certain doom by hurtling towards the sun you are rescued by a team of researchers calling themselves red acropolis
it seems they know about dravis sabotage and that he was ultimately behind the rogue robot activity in the first place
as the only pilot with enough guts to tackle the situation it is your duty to gather the evidence to incriminate dravisof course this is just the intro movie
the rest of the singleplayer campaign features  gigantic levels
and i do emphasize gigantic  these behemoths are many times the size of the old descent levels and yet still only load once at the beginning
inhabiting them naturally are a varied assortment of robots arranged in various classes  security drones miners and even robots that sweep the floor
these are your obstacles on the way  to completing your mission objectives
unlike the first two games which were built around gathering keys destroying a reactor then escaping the mine descent  has objectives for each level that must be accomplished
these include escorting important ships going on recon missions and in an ironic nod to the old games defending the reactors from destructionto carry these out you find all sorts of neat weapons
there are ten different primary weapons and ten secondary weapons
primaries include your basic laser cannon chaingunlike vauss cannon railgunlike mass driver searing napalm cannon and shield sucking omega cannon
the secondaries are equally diverse and include such hits as the napalm missile that bursts into flame the frag missile that bursts into a thousand shards and the awesome gravityaltering black shark missile that sucks your enemies into a black holemultiplayer is fantastic
new multiplayer levels are always coming out and the action never grows old
descent  comes with many gameplay modes for multiplayer
anarchy is your traditional deathmatch and as you might expect team anarchy is also present
capture the flag is also represented and built more like other games in this regard as opposed to the bizarre interpretation of it in descent   one of the more intriguing modes is entropy a team game where you must collect viruses and infect the bases of the opposing teambeing that this game will be four years old this year it is becoming very hard to find it
but should you come across it i would strongly recommend a purchase
this is one of the finest pc games ever designed
just because players didnt acknowledge it back in  doesnt mean you have to
a fantastic game a fantastic community and years of playability
who could ask for anything moreone word wow
this is a great game it has tons of skills and charecters
all i have to say is this is a great gamestar ocean  is an excellent game that did not get as much attention as it deserved but i suppose thats a blessing in its own way since it kept the prices down and allowed me to get it extremely cheapthe storyline is not cliched or unoriginal as some might think
i hate it when people take a completely unique story ignore all of its distinctive features dumb it down into a bunch of sweeping generalizations and then call it unoriginal
the characters are far more likeable than the heroes square has been churning out lately
this story is a lot more lighthearted than squares latest stories too which will be seen as good by some players and bad by others
i personally like the brighter and more heroic overtones of this game since it reminds me of squaresofts snes titles back when they truly did their best workthe sound effects are decent though there arent many of them except for special attacks and impact sounds
the voices are good not perfect but good
sometimes their dialogue can be rather cheesy but i havent found any cases of bad translation or poor grammar
whoever said this game had poor translation needs to take a closer look at some of squares latest titles especially ff quotdont give her itquot
and its a cool effect to have characters who speak during battle and will say things in response to what happens in the fight
the music is excellent definitely reminiscent of the inspiring tunes of the snes titles
each town has a different song with it and the music in dungeons and the like will easily set the atmosphere
the battle music is also fastpaced and catchy as battle music should bethe battle system is awesome combining some of the best aspects of action and strategy
the fights are realtime but the action is paused while you use menus much like the original secret of mana
also like secret of mana you can assign your aicontrolled partners different things to do in battles and they are very good when it comes to following your commands
if you tell your healer to heal and stay away from the enemies she will do just that
you can choose various formations for battles
another interesting feature is that special attacks will use different effects depending on your range from the enemy
for example one attack called air slash will slice a circle around you if you are close to enemies but will send a cutting shockwave across the field if they are at a distancethe character development aspects are wonderful
you can to some extent control which characters will like others and how well they get along
and the closer they become the more interesting things can happen
this can even effect battles
these arent major things but they certainly add a lot more depth and personality to the game
you control which skills the characters learn as well
not only battle skills but also metalwork alchemy cooking art photography music  all sorts of things
and all of the skills actually have some good use to them rather than just being there as a gimmickthe graphics in this game are good as well
they are rather cartoony but the cartoon style conveys personality and emotion far better than polygons do
there are also more subtle touches that add to it such as birds flying over seeing your character darken when you walk through a shadow and seeing your reflection on water surfacesall things considered i dont see any major bad points to discuss in this game
its a great one to own especially for anyone who likes the superior quality rpgs from the snes daysperhaps my favorite rpg of all time star ocean  has everything any gamer could enjoy
with an amazingly innovative battle system star ocean  plunges you into battle where you fight and cast magic in real time combat
also star ocean  has amazing customization where you can make your own items and the best weapons in the game using the games unique weaponitem creation system
with an amazingly unique soundtrack star ocean  ranks in my soundtrack list as one of my top three
also star ocean  has an amazing cast of characters all of which save two are optional
finally it has the highest replay value of any game ever
you are right off the bat asked which character you would prefer to play the dashing space explorer claude kenni or the beautiful magic user rena lanford
by going through this game you will go through different towns meet different people and the feelings of the characters will change for each other for better or worse and in the end characters will split up or possibly even get together
with over  different endings youll find yourself playing from the end of star ocean  right into your next fun filled new game
words cannot describe my appreciation for the quality of this game it is simply breathtakingi played this game shortly after high school and was very immersed in it
in fact i could not stop playing until i had finished it
the music is wonderful and the graphics are good for what they represent
character interaction is very detailed with your choices affecting the games ending
battle is fun and the storyline is worthwhile
i am aware they have made a remake but i am more interested in replaying the genuine articlei love this game
yet i hate the glitches on this game
lol still this is one of the best games one the psx
just make sure that you save often cause the game might freeze unexpectedlyyou start out as one of the two heros of the game on renas home planet expel
something strange has crashed on expel and is causing chaos
you now need to go learn more about it and discover what it is
but that is only the beginning
your travels takes you to several villages and towns meeting several party members you may choose to go along
earn skill points to boost your skills such as cooking writing alchamy and reverse side forgery
as you continue through out the game you can increase or decrease party members attitudes twards each other in result earns you special endings
you can see up to as many as  endingspros smooth fighting style beautiful music very high replay value and interesting story lines
not to mention frequent save points
pa private actions are one the the highlights of the game where you can intereact soley with another party membercons some mage scenes in combat can take a few seconds to finish easy to over look
sometimes will lock up after a fight
this is very rare but can be a pain
the grapics are alittle old style but nothing to really complain aboutall and all i think this is a wonderful game i myself has played it  times without getting sick of it because the story can change so much depending what you doi think that so is one of the most enjoyable experience on the playstationit has a unique skill systemvery lovable charctersinteresting storynice graphicsi love it and im still playing it till nowperhaps the worst thing about the gamealthough its not that bad and some like challengesis the dungeons sometimes they seem a bit long and altough i like battling especially with fightersit can be a little bit tiring sometimesso i recommend using the gameshark code for saving anywhere and beating the game will be a piece o cakestar ocean the second story in my humble opinion is nothing short of a masterpiecesuch underrated game never got the credit it deservesthe masterful gameplay and the many features are the best aspect of gamethe positive countless features fantastic real time battle system complex skill system best motoi sakuraba soundtrack great prerendered graphics private actions relation system great nonlinear story countless sidequest difficult game  battle system outstanding replay value over  endings  perspectives of story private actions make characters very deepthe negative voice acting glitches bugs world map graphics the story dont reliance on the other characters aside the main heroesgraphics soundtrack story character development gameplay fun factor miscellaneouslenght  long looooong quest the main story its about over  hours  with sidequestsdifficulty  hard to insane  you get new difficulty level to replay the gamereplay value  endings  perspective of story new characters new difficulty level different private action
what else
excellentthe sequel to the game of the same namewhich unfortunately was never released in america star ocean  is the perfect rpgthe skill system is one of the things that sets it apart from any other game
there are around  skills to learn with  levels of profiency eacheach of which requires a certain number of skill points to learn which are gained when you level up
combat skills are automatically executed with the frequency depending on how many levels you have invested in the skillexamples quotflipquot lets your character quickly move behind the enemy where his defensive power is lower
quotparryquot lets you block attacks quotmotormouthquot lets you cast spells fasterthe other skills have  purposes
they have an initial bonus to investing in them and they can combine with other skills to produce specialty skills
for example quotkitchen knifequot adds a huge boost to your strength stat and if you add quotrecipequot and quotgood eyequot you will acquire the quotcookingquot super specialty skill which allows you to create very powerful healing items out of base componentsyou can even make french toast this way
if multiple characters have a high cooking skill the super specialty skill quotmaster chefquot becomes availible letting you make even more powerful healing items
there are similar skills for producing weapons armor and accessories
other skills like art or authoring lets you make pictures to sell or books to publish which can result it huge amounts of cash for you
there is even a skill that reduces the experience requirement for levelling up
this is the quottip of the icebergquot so to speak so i will just say that the skill system is above and beyond any other game that i have playedthe combat system is also excellent
you have  charactersout of a maximum of  in your party which is out of  characters in the game fight in realtime combat against enemies
you control a single character at a time while the rest follow the tactics that you set and the ai for this feature is also well done
your fighter characters have an assortment of quotkiller movesquot instead of spells that let them unload a series of special attacks against the enemy
words cant describe the flawlessness of this combat system you would have to watch a trailer to get a real feel for itthe basic game is sufficiently challenging but once you have played through the game you will be able to access higher difficulty settingswhich are very very hard which combined with the variety of characters you can recruit make for lots of replay valuealso of worthy note is the voice acting
your characters will strike yell taunt and basically talk during combat
they cry out a characters name who has just fallen to the enemy
if you have played grandia  you will have an idea what i am talking about
the sound quality is clear and easy to understand though when claude yells quottear into piecesquot it sounds like he is saying quotpear into peachesquotplot is excellent with a huge thing at the end of disk  that rivals aeris in final fantasy  in terms of its impact on the plotoverall fun factor is very high
this is the perfect rpgthis may be a dated title but i will still go out of my way to bring out and dust off my old ps to play this gameto begin the size and depth of this game is extraordinary for its time
i couldnt believe it upon first play
the regions to explore are expansive
the situations that occur at each location differ depending upon your party and events that you have accomplished elsewheresecond the battle system is incredible
it is a truetoform rpg yet has characteristics of liveaction battle
it goes far beyond selecting your actions and watching them unfold
you control one character and the ai for your other party members is quite effective
in the most strategic battles i find myself jumping between characters to throw little moves inbetween their automationsnext the story is a little complex even diluted at times but still brilliant and engaging assuming that you have the desire to embrace it
the discussions are rarely so lengthy that it causes you to lose interestfinally the skills and spells of your characters are diverse and change with enough uses to become stronger and more effective
with the integration of comboskills your fighter becomes a beast
the weapons and equipment for your characters provide a diverse and strategic edgeto conclude although aged this title still glimmers within my collection
for classic gamers this is a mustbeing few lucky one to play star ocean for super famicom i was very excited to play star ocean  for good reasons
the original was one of best game for snessfc as good as ff and this one is charming as well
the background is well drawn and d based characters didnt hurt the visual eitherthe battle system is revised version of the first one
for fans of final fantasy series may dismiss it as simple button masher but the beauty of this system appears when you face the boss
since there arent any overpowering summons tactical thinking is critical
you can take total control of one character and shift the battle in any way you like i heavily use rena for healing and protect celinetranslation is not so bad
it has some mishap which makes some section sound downright silly but overall translation is well done if not brilliant
voice acting is well i wish there was option to turn it off
luckily i got used to it by th hour but precis voice is horriblethe story is compelling
while this one uses similar quotadvanced civilization human meets undeveloped onequot it is for good
storyline is very solid and characters are very attactive to grab your attention
this game gives very different feeling than final fantasy series and it certainly wont hurt to experienceoverall star ocean  brings best of new and oldschool rpg
i just cant wait to play star ocean  and hope to see blue sphere in us
i reset the machine many times just to listen the opening themeive had this game since not too long after it came out and i still play it
i had to replace my disc on amazon after the case was broken and someone decided it would make a nice coaster one too many times
i made an iso with my new disc and now it sits as back up safely in a box and i can play this glorious game foreveri love this game
building my own dungeon slapping monsters fighting rival dungeon masters may favourite mode is the pet dungeon mode where there are no enemies just goals to achieve
it offers quite a bit of challenge without being terribly frustratingthe graphics are great for its generation
it doesnt run on anything past  without the patch which i have if anyone needs it
i played it on a windows  machine with no issues and it runs on my xp machine without issues as well
the comments made by the narrator are hilarious and the game play is intuitive and quick to control
building up dungeons earning new rooms and monsters trying to sacrifice enough to get the dark angel stopping the mistresses from wasting their time torturing each other slapping the salamanders to increase their efficiency as well as imps to death watching the monsters dance to disco inferno when one hits jackpot its simply an enjoyable game with tons of replay value
i grew up playing this game
i can stay up all night with this game and not lose interest even to this dayall the legal crap died off on this game years ago
it is actually available for free and fully patched to work on new computersdont buy the disc version as it doesnt include the patch needed to run on anything past windows me
the patched version still suffers from crashing howeverthis is by far one of the most addictive games ever released
much like its predecesor dk is addictive funny and perfect in just about every other way
the best thing over dk is that the dark sense of humor is  perfect now
much like the first there is no cursing or anything but the  narrator and the little cutscences everything is perfect for the dark  humor theme
this game itself is definitely the best strategy game of its  time
non stop action lots of replay value skirmish and multiplayer  rounds out this package that should be a part of your collection if you  like rts gamesthe graphics are decent the objectives are challenging and you get to play the villainwhat could go wrong
true it doesnt always work on all computers and crashes a lot but if you keep up with saves its not really that big of a deal
i do warn you that this game is pretty addictive once you get it running smoothly thoughi love this game
im a huge alien and predator fan and this games makes them epic
to sum it up it has a great storyline great graphics dark fun and scary environments and a good difficulty
if you love blood spraying out of victims this is the right game for you
the music in the game and the full motion videos are tight
one of the best ive seen and heard in a  game
this is like the super mario bros of pc and mac
its that popular
the boos battles are great
theyll indeed keep you busy for a while
far as long as i live this will always be one of my top favorite games of all time
this game came out when i was in jr high and it still seriously entertains me
one thing i will say is that minus the graphics dont get the new avp remake
it is bad compared to this
this is tons better
why they made a remake that i almost got but didnt cause it was a smart choice i have no clue why they made it
also in conclusion there are bonus missions at the end which are a lot of fun
hope you choose and enjoy this gamethis is a hard but incredibley fun and sorta scary and very cheap when you buy this on steam for 
and this
but not as cheapyikes
call me a wuss but some of the areas in avp made me jump out of my chair
the atmosphere in most of the levels are very dark so when something jumps out at you your heart rate tends to skyrocket
the  facehuggers are especially nasty and cheap jumping out and landing on  your face for an instant kill
my god when a facehugger jumps on your  face making an awful hissing noise and quite abruptly takes up  of the  screen its a wonder why fox interactive hasnt been sued yet for causing  a few heart attacks
and man this game is hard
but fox has released a  patch with a save feature so its okay now
believe me this game is not  intended for the faint of heart
but for those of us who arent go out  and buy this
and play it at night toowith the lights turned offthis game is something to shout about
let me rephrase that  these  games are something to shout about
thats basically what you get
the different characters are varied enough to make this a highly original fps  which has features important enough to make it a landmark fps
it may not  be halflife or ss but its damnright up there with the best of themthis  must be the best movie spinoff of all time
the games mirror the movies so  much
from the sounds the aliens and predators make to the way the predator  uses his medikit
every aspect of the movie is there
the marine levels are  the scariest i have ever seen
aliens appear from nowhere and with surround  sound i guarantee you will jump in fright in no timethe cut scenes are  gorgeous and once you complete a game there are bonus levels
you have to  complete the game on the hardest level to get all of themthis game also  saw the first use of limited game saving per level
this is great as you  cant save your game every  seconds
this has been seen in later games  since
you will replay bits and it is tough but at least you have to use  your brain and skill a bit morethe marine levels were my favourite  followed by the predator
each character has different attack modes and  ways of moving
for instance the predator can survive high jumps while the  alien is the quickest and hardest to hit but takes most damage
learnin  these skills is a key to sucess
there are also nice touches like the  predator being able to pull the heads off marines and aliens blood spraying  at youthe predator has the different vision modes while the alien has  the fish vision mode
while a marine it sometimes felt like half life but  its the closest youll get to being in the movie
the guns make the same  noise theres the constant beep of the detector which speeds up as an alien  gets closer
it cant be faulted for realismthe multiplayer aspect is  super also as you get to fight a mixture of baddies
theres a big online  contingent of players out there
afrer quake unreal tournement and team  fortress this probably comes next in the hierarchythe only fault is  that there could have been more levels and maybe the storyline could have  been a bit better being picky
still this does not detract from a pc  classic with gripping atmosphere and moments that will give you  nightmaresit is a great fps even without the movie license which should  appeal to fans of both the movie and gaming genrei cannot say enough  good things about this game
especially in a time when fps are  a penny
this has new elements like the save options  game modes and vision modes  that makes this a cut above most other fps out there
this game has added  to the fps genre for sure
you can almost hear the cries of quotgame over  man game overquot
go get it nowone of a fingerful of firstpersonshooters that actually tries something new aliens vs predator is fantastic for as long as it lasts which  unfortunately isnt all that long
splitting the game into marine alien  and predator phases ensures great variety but you feel that youre playing  three short games instead of one long one
still its worth the price for  the alien segments alone
whilst the marine stages are superior shootemup  action with an extremely scary atmosphere and the predator section seems  oddly detatched we never learn enough about the creature in the films to  care much although the execution of his multiple vision modes is superb  the alien sections could be a game in themselves
treating ceilings and  walls as if they were floors as the alien you have to keep yourself  hidden and restrict your combat to quick darts from the shadows
the  feeling of power as you cling to a roof high above your blinded  blundering victimtobe is addictive and soon youll be disappointed that  people dont scream in horror when you approach them in real lifethe  graphics and sound are topnotch both in their own right and as  adaptations of existing material
the alien and human environments match  those of the film and the selection of weaponry intelligently expands on  that presented in aliens
best of all there are lots of nice touches   the sound and music is sampled from the films the predators vision modes  switch with a familiar whack noise and youre encouraged to replay the  game by an extensive series of bonus items bestowed by achieving certain  difficult goals
the short fmv sequences are topnotch tooa word of  warning  its extremely hard and very intense
the marine spends most of  his time running backwards from approaching aliens and if you stand on a  facehugger you will leap out of your skin the alien is vulnerable to  bullets and the predator whilst tough is overcome by sheer weight of  numbers
unless you download a patch you cant even save the game within a  mission something which is both admirably brave of the programmers and  extremely intimidatingall in all its twothirds superior shootemup  and onethird genius polished until it shines and pumped up with steroidsanyone who likes video games and has seen the movies would really like this game even if you havent seen the movies youed still like the fluid graphics and great detail
one of the best aspects of this game is the  sound
everything from the motion detecter to the aliens sounds to the  predators clicking type sound is exactly like in the movies i really  appriciate this as it adds to the overall experience
the graphics are  smooth and good looking
the predators look a lot like in the movies and  the aliens are so well done i had to pause the game and marvel at the  detail
when you first get this game do the marine mission if you are  looking to be scared out of your wits
in the game you can play as all  three different racespredatoraliencolonel marineall with their own  missions plus bonus missions
the alien aiartifical intelegence is really  really good
you can be standing there minding your own business and then  an alien will drop down from the ceiling when you didnt even know it was  sneaking up on you
the only notable complaint is that the predators cloak  only actually keeps you unseen for about  secondsit doesnt go off or  anything its just all of a sudden they can see you even if its up which of  course lead my theory that you should kill them in  seconds or lesswith  your cloak up if you wanna go undetected
also staying true to the movies  the predator is extreamly hard to kill whether you are playing as him or  fighting him
and the aliens are brittle but really really really fast and  yes you can climb all over the walls at top speed when you play the alien  the colonel marines are both brittle and slow but they have big  weaponrychain gun with  rounds anyone
also the chain guns sound is  really good and pumps the rounds out really fast
they also have a lot of  other weaponryall in all this is the best fpsfirst person shooter to  date especially if you are an alienpredator fani have been a sonic fan since the beginning
i had played every single sonic game for the genesis
i had watched sonic cartoon episodes and the sonic movie countless times
i had read as many sonic comics as i could handle
i crammed my head with as much stuff about sonic as i could
i even created my own sonic website
but after a while the same old levels on the original sonic games got old
i needed something new
i needed something fresh
then i heard about sonic adventure
just because of me being a sonic fanatic sonic adventure and the dreamcast were at the top of my christmas list
finally i received it along with a dreamcast and popped it in
as soon as the opening sequence began i was stunned
i was amazed at the great graphics and use of real music with vocals and all
plus sonic looked cooler than ever
then the game got even better because of the ability to be  different classic sonic characters and some new ones
the game is perfect because each character has a different story line that blends in with another characters story
plus the classic sonic and tails brothership and sonic and knuckles competivness still remain
if you are a true sonic fan like me though you might be a little disappointed
the game missed many classic sonic elements and sonics orgin is totally changed
the freedom fighters are gone sonic lives on earth instead of mobius and tails age has gone up by  years while sonics only has risen by  plus sonic adventure is more childish than previous sonic games because of the chao pets
the game should be more focused one defeating robotnik instead of raising a little petstill the game has the classic sonic feel to it because the chaos emeralds are still intact and when you collect them you can become an even better super sonic than the one in the previous years
other great additions include minigames and d cinema scenes
one of the best parts of the game is the remake of the original ice cap stage from sonic  and the ability to ride a snowboard that you can actually control unlike in the original
if you are a sonic fan this is a musthavethis game rules
my fifth favorite sonic game
your asking what the mistakes are
well when sonic and knucles talk their eyes move up and down
some of the stupid stuff but funny is when sonic dies he spins around like he is dancing and says quotoh noquot in a perfectly calm voice
and when knucles falls off of a clif he screams quotahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhwquot and it really made me laugh
if you want to laugh really loud when you are facing sonic when you are knucles when he says quotive had enough of thisquot hit him right then
then it will sound really stupid
quotive had enough of thisoh noquot and when you race sonic as tails when he passes you he says quothowway no im serious he says howway instead of horrayquot or quotcya later tailsquot but when you pass him he says quothey hey heyquot it is so freakin funny
or he says quotalright tailsquot but this game is still very awesome
the game play rocks
and how come i am the only one who notices the dumb and funny stuff in the sonic adventure seiresand chaos
common
who doesnt love chaos
this game was such a showpiece of what the dreamcast could do and those little critters and their morphing was so in depth
of course it was really annoying that the same button to pick them up also spin dashed into them potentially killing them ackwhen i heard of this game  years ago i knew i had to have it
i saw the amazing cg feature on sonic mega collection and i bought a dreamcast just to get sonic adventure
when i saw that the graphics really werent so great i thought it was gonna be a bomb to me
but after playing it i realized that i was wrong
i grew to loving itproseverything except the consconsgraphicswhich sadx fixed anywaythe cg opening never appears in the gamethe fact that whenever you enter another area of a town the music stopswhich sadx also fixesever since the sadx directors cut version came out just  months after i got the original i havent been playing the dreamcast version so much
but occasionaly i give it a spin for old times sake
great game but dont buy it if you already have sadx unless youre a collecter i like i am or was seeing as the sonic series is dead and has been dead since sonic heroes came outyes this game makes me shed a tear because as i am writing this review two things are happeninga sega has all but given up on the dreamcast and is now moving on to being a third party developerb memories of playing this game when i bought my dreamcast last year comes flooding backthis is a beautiful game and it will always be one of my favorite games on the dreamcast
it isnt really as fun as sonic  or  on the genesis simply because it is heck lot more complicatedbut if you likea detailed graphics b clear sound c a good adventure gamethis one is for you
i cant even think about a single reason why the playstationsps popularity is continuing when the dreamcast has a much better mascot and a great game like thisalso youll be moved by the heartbreaking story of the robot ally e or something that part when he died and the little bird was finally together with amys bird will make you want to cryall in all im kind of saddened that segas console is fading but if any game whose top notch gameplay can remain an eternal tribute to the dying console then sonic adventure stands at the top shining like the brightest star in the universeplay it and remember iti dont like platform gamesi thought id absolutely hate this  gamebut its really coolthe frame rate is absolutel amazing with no not a bit of pop upthe graphics are incredible as wellsonic and his fully d environments look greatthis game is really cool and is probably like nothing youve playedsonic does huuuuuuuge cool jumps and runs real fast and the frame rate and grphics keep up with himthe sound is also really good the effects and music fit this game perfectlythe dreamcast is dead no more consoles from sega great games lost
not neccasirly you can get them on the gamecube too
however i was hear to write a reviewthis game is fast action and exploration and questing
there are missions you have to unlock and sub missions you must complete plus you can switch between characters
and each characters levels differ like tails racing sonic or knuckles finding shards this was quite possibly the best platformer ever made
it puts mario to shame and i hope the known world undesrtands thisits a very good game great grapics rating grapics fun rating gameplay how long it lasts well about  hours to do everything but im a advence player a avarage person about  hours so gameplay the sound is great
i really like what sonic team did for the sound sound rating and overall i would say  and or me  out of awesomenow the game is with  playable characters sonicthe main fast blue hengehog tailsthe two tailed fast and flying fox knucklesthe echina he glides and he is red very cool amysonics pink quotgirlfriendquot biga purple big cat that fishs to get fish and a red robot eoc
sorry if i got the robots name wrong i havent played it in a while
one thing i have say if you dont have it quotget itquotthe day the sega dreamcast was launched with a few dozen titles available at launch
one of them was sonic adventure
i have played every genesis sonic game for hours and hours and have been a huge fan of sonic ever since
i was very excited when i got this game with my dreamcasti started to play with sonic
the game was awesome
then i realized you could play with five other characters
tails knuckles big the robot and amy
each character has  or so levels for each of them and are also very different for each character
each character is very fun to play as especially sonic knuckles and tails
surprisingly big and the robot are very fun to play with
but sega should never have created such a dumb character as amy
she is very annoying hard to play with and is very hard to control as wellthis game has a few flaws though like falling through the floor for no reason at all
also the camera angles are not the way you want them to be very often and this game is too easy on all levels for almost all of the characters
sonic adventure is also kind of shorteven with these few flaws sonic adventure is a great game that will keep you playing for hours on end having a ton of fun
if youre a real sonic fan do yourself a favor and go buy this game and sonic adventure  right nowi own this game not nor a dreamcast
yet i am a hardcore gamer and play games i do not own avidly
i play them at friends house and onlinecontrols  sound  graphics  replay  plot in a word awesome
in two words awesome awesomei cannot begin to tell you how much i highly recommend thisthis is the game that started it all for the dreamcast
sonic got a new look and a whole new level of appreciation
to bad after sonic adventure  things started to turn sour as he got ported to other systemsalmost a decade later and i still have my appreciation for this titleyes not everything is perfect but its still way above averageif you never played it before please pick it up if you have a dreamcast
you will not be dissapointed at all and it is well worth the  you will spend for iti never recieved my game so i cant say but i used to love playing this good game to bring out child memorieswhat a lot of people dont realize was that this game set a new standard for d video games
it lets you play a different game with each character and explore the world of segas sonic world
the graphics and music are awesome and the game is challenging but never impossible
sega should put a lot of time into sonic adventure  if there ever will be onewhat i like the most about this game is that like super mario  before it sonic adventure is one of those games i never get tired of no matter how many times i beat it
the story is great and the cinema like sequences are awesome
yes the camera angles can get frustrating at times and the newerslightly more graphically detailed game cube version with its bonus game gear games may be a better buy according to many people but it doesnt match that special nostalgic quality you get from playing sonic adventure on the dreamcastsoul calibur may be the greatest multiplayer game on the dreamcast but sonic adventure is the best single player game for the dreamcast and my choice for best overall sega dreamcast gamethere are so many things to say about this game id probably go into it for another  minutes if i werent short on time
this game is a winner through and through
the graphics and the music are both terrific and the control scheme is exactly what it should be for a d sonic game unlike most of the new ones coming out on gamecube ps and all the newer systems
this is the one that came out before all those so it rightfully deserves credibility
even if this game wasnt very good it would still be a must have just to showcase what segas dream was but they perfectly portrayed that dream with the sonic adventure
the story is a little weird at times as in not explaining things not to mention the ending was a bit corny but who cares
this game is a loooooaaaaad of fun
if you want the ultimate sonic experience then you need to have this game
it cost a little extra to get the original case but it was definitely worth it
alright segagame is great and a fun one to play
no doubt would buy again if i somehow lost it
great quality
must buya great game sonic adventure has a great look to it snow forest city and other scenery
the animation and gameplay make everything move so smooth
even if you finish with all  characters there are challenges eg
time limit rings beat robotnik  to finish
absolutely grandsonic adventure was my first dreamcast game and to this day its still in my topten of all time favorite games  on any system  ever
two weeks before i picked up sonic adventure i saw the demo in a video game store and was  blown away  by what i saw
my all time favorite hedgehog moving so fast that my eyes could hardly keep up with him and the graphics of  bit bliss was awesome indeed
after i brought it home a few weeks later i was again blown away by the free roaming d gameplay of this awesome game
sonic adventure was  and is  so big and so grand that i find it hard to write just a paragraph on the game but here it goes
the game takes place on angel island  a floating island   and it is somehow connected to a city
you have six players in this awesome game
theres sonic the hedgehog miles tails prower amy rose  sonics love interest  knuckles the echidna big the cat and e gamma
 one of eggmans robots  you must stop eggman from feeding the seven chaos emeralds to the evil monster chaos also known as  the god of destruction 
the game moves so fast at times it makes one dizzy
 and try not to barf 
besides the  adventure mode  you have the  action stages  and the cute lil chaos to take care of in the chao gardens
its kind of a virtual pet that you can interact with and you can even download mini games onto the vmu memory card then take the vmu out of the controller and play the game separately on it
 cool  you have many mini games action stages powerups worlds and objectives to play in this wonder of a game
its part action rpg fishing exploratory puzzle racing shootemup and fighting game all rolled into one big adventure
 whew  if there ever was a game that gave the player his or her moneys worth this game does it well
if there was any complaint i might have its that i hate the fishing levels with big the cat
 its hard as hell to me  sonic adventure for the sega dreamcast is one of the best games ever made for this great system
even nights into dreams makes a cameo appearance in the game
 its very cool  so if youre into sonic and have a dreamcast this game must be in your collection for it to be complete
yuji naka and the sonic team did it again in spades 
happy gaming goodbye to d worlds and hello to d environments
sonic and other returuning faves such as tails knuckles and amy with new roles such as e and big the cat or biggums as i like to call him
now sonic is putting a bigger emphasis on exploring in new worlds
the plot is easily one of the best
the dialouge between these characters are very good and not chessy one bit
here the plotchaos  is released from the master emerald by eggman and he feeds on the chaos emeralds
chaos  is upset by an earlier experience but telling it would be a spolier
six characters has a different storyline but in the end they all intersect into one huge battle
spolier chaos  turns into chaos  and turns the town into his own personal waterpark
sonic absorbs the posistive power of the emeralds and turns into super sonic to defeat the humongous chaos  and the fate of the world lies in the hand of sonic the hedgehogspolier
yuji naki is the creator of the supreme hedgehog franchise
the only  person is big the fat
the niggling fishing game must be removed
its the worst thing on the planet
thank god biggums is nowhere to be found in sonic adventure battlefirst of all the graphics rule
the fmas and opening title have perfectly smooth graphics
and for those of you that thought stardust speedway in sonic cd was fast wait until you try speed highway with sonic
i was able to obtain the a emblem with a time of  seconds
there are six characters to choose from three of which are new
the old three are back
thats right sonic duh tails and knuckles
the other three are amy rose big the cat and e gamma
if any of you like fishing play as big
and then there are the powerups
they focus on making the characters more powerful
and there is a hidden character super sonic
this game could use hyper knuckles but who cares
and chaos is a cool boss
the new moves characters and permanent powerups make this game one of the best games on earth
reccommended for all that existsonic adventure is an amazing game for the sega dreamcast in  this game is a success to the d sonic games but now with added storycharacters sonic adventure is where we play as any of the characters starting with sonic then tails and knuckles with better abilities for example knuckles can dig under ground
amy rose returns from her sonic cd debut with abilities that require her hammer
big the cat has nothing interesting except for fishingthen theres gamma dr robotniks newest robot with abilities

sonic adventure is addictive until you beat itthis is much better than sonic adventure  the graphics on the second are not quite as astonishing and the storyline is a little weakerthis game is moreless for children but adults can get a kick out of this too
you can tell sega spent time on this game
this isnt just junk thrown together
the multicharacter usage and storylines are a good idea
it adds replay value to the gamethis game is nothing like the previous sonic games
this is totally different
a different style of game play
this could be considered a small short role playing game in some wayssurprisingly this game is not easy like i thought it would be
if you want a challenge try this out
this isnt a game you can just beat in one day unless you spend all day playing iti have to say this game is worth the money
take advantagegraphics  out of sound  out of gameplay  out of storyline  out of replay value  out of dont let the replay value discourage your decision
there isnt any sonic game that is worthy of a  out of  replay valueget this gamei reviewed this game a year ago
i gave it four stars then
i reviewed it again today
that rating is now at  starsbefore i start i want to get a few things straight
unfortunatly sega made the dreamcast its last system
the sega saturn turned most people away from the dreamcast mainly because the saturn 
production of dreamcasts has stopped
this is why i own two
sega moved from a firstparty developer to a thirdparty
they have started producing games for other systems starting with sonic adventure  on the gamecube and sonic advance for the game boy advance
why theyre hugging onto nintendo i dont know but i thank them for not going to sony or microsoft
with that said lets start talking about the gamefirst off if sonic adventure is too fast or hard for you just go sell your dreamcast you cant handle it
the game wasnt made to be fast or hard
it was made as an introduction to the dreamcasts awesome power and to carry the sonic legend on
in my opinion sonic is easy
there is no point in buying a guide
it is just the right speed and i wish it was faster
but this is just my opinionin a graphical standpoint sonic adventure is amazing
the crisp visuals and notsooften slowdown turned most people on
rock on sega
 out of  for graphicsthe sound
whoo boy theres the problem
it has an awesome soundtrack
but the voice acting
did they hire a yearold for tails
big sounds like a 
good voice choices elesewhere but the acting 
 out of  sega
redeem yourselvesreplay value
it skyrockets
there are five characters to play as all with their own stories and objectives
the game doesnt end after each character has been completed
instead one more character is introduced one that has been in every sonic game to date
can you guess his name
the first word rhymes with cooper
 out of  for replaythe overall score
if you dont know that you must be flipping
how many stars did i give it genius
read the review for the love of petethose who just pass up the dreamcast because of segas past image are missing out on a treat
happy halloween gamers
go buy this system while there are still ones on the shelf
pick up sonic and soul calibur while youre at it
good gaminginspired a lot by nintendos smash hit super mario  sonic adventure is a massive breathtaking game that rarely comes along
sonic returns alongside his old buds tails and knuckles with some other characters to once again battle dr robotnik
while you can tell this game was designed primarily for younger kids older gamers will love playing sonic adventure
the levels are massive the graphics are unbelieveable and the virtual pet chao is a cool addition to an allready awesome game
the only problem is the camera angle can get awkward very quickly on certain levels causing you to misjudge your distance when you jump and leading to frustrating deaths but when you get the hang of it it becomes simple
all in all the one dreamcast game along with shenmue which is very recommended that is essential in your collection if you own a dreamcastthis is the kind of game that brings back memories of when  games were great
the game has the most beautiful graphics i have seen on a video game  system the graphics are even better than anything a computer can currently  do
the game is relly fun with great music and a total of  different  playable characters all with their own missions and thier own view of the  story
if you buy the dreamcast buy this tooif you own a sega dreamcast and do not own sonic adventure then your system is not complete
this game is truly amazing
it displays the power of the dreamcast and delivers nothing but pure solid fun
it is unlike any of the older sonic games which by the way were pretty hard
not only do you play as sonic and other characters but you get to play minigames and raise your own virtual pet
a must have for all dreamcast ownersthis video game is awesome the graphics arent even that bad
if you have a dreamcast i totally recommend it
if you dont have a dreamcast you can just get the gamecube version for your gamecubewii
its almost the same just the graphics are enhanced and theres more to do
if you can get it for under  then you should get it
theres still a lot to do and i dont think it finishes fast
it took me a while to beat all of the bosses
tails isnt stuck in a machine eitherhe can fly around easily
the chao are also awesome i really recommend this game you cant have a dreamcast collection without itthis game is great thear not much to say
if you have a dreacmcast you need to have this oneive been loving all the sonic the hedgehog games since i was  yrs
old
i love the sonic adventure game
when i first played the sonic adventure game i had a reaction to the game
my stomach had got weak like i was gonna vomit throw up
it took me about a month to get used to sonic adventure
i like the casinopolis level where i do the fly through the rings with nights in the nights pinball
even though i dont listen to rock music the title screen super sonic themeend credits sky deck level and final egg level have the rock music which its definitely all that
also windy valley level  the air music is similar to the sega genesis sonic d blasts green grove act  and twinkle park level with sonic where you ride the race car music is similar to the sonic d blasts panic puppet act level select
the sonic adventure game is the prettiest and it is definitely all that
sonic adventure is a nice game to buysonic adventure is not only the best d sonic game everbut its also one of the best dreamcast games everthe plot is great
with the whole chao processing boss levels and the plot with eggman
this just about the best sonic game ever
i thought sonic  was greatthis is the besti loved the plot too
it was just so great for melets startgameplayoh its great
its awesomei just loved how the game works and the levels get more and more fun and your tasks at the station square makes the game excitingcamerai put this for a reasonthis game can get soo frustrating with the camera angle like for example if i need to get through a boss battle and cant see the boss and im trying to move the camera angle it will like get stuck and i cant move it
but still its worth gettingand yes im still going to give it graphicsohspectacularyea my spelling sucksthe graphics are awesomei love emgreat graphics for sonic and great game to launch the once popular and now dead dreamcastwell thats a lil harsh saying deadlong live dreamcastthe graphcis in this game were ten times better then a few ps gamesvoices are horrible in this gamelisten to it in japanesits better then the horrible english voice actingbut the music and sound make up for itsoundthe sound is great
i love the music in the gameits greatsonic adventure is everything you wanted in a sonic gameit will always be from my opinion sonicsgreatestadventurethats what the game should have bin titledi also like how everytime you meet a character you gain themthats pretty coolover all this game gets a  out of great gamei loved itclassic dreamcast gamelaterhow complicated must it be for sega to make a game on a console thats still in development at the same time
and yet the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty topnotch
theyve pulled through then i guessthe game lets you choose to play as  different characters however you unlock them by playing as sonic first
we have sonic of course tails amy knuckles e omega andbig the cateach of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics as well as goals and certain levels
below is the fun factor for each charactersonic  the levels are actually pretty straightforward
you simply go from start to finish
and boy was it fun its actually pretty close to the genesis sonic games but in d
collect rings bash robots you knowthe good stuff
plus there are some new levelspecific gameplay mechanics included like twinkle parks bumper car riding and sky chases airplane combat
you may as well buy this game just for sonic alone
after all as the title character he has the most levels to go throughtails  more or less like sonics gameplay except he has to race sonic later eggman in speed highway in each level
its not as bad as it may sound because it only just keeps the pace going which is great and dont you think its kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flyingknuckles  rather than going from start to finish knuckles has to find  emeralds in each level
so how do you do so
you glide around the place and see if an emerald is picked up on a radar really helpful and they could be hidden in enemies or other places
the only minor and only minor downside with knuckles is that there are only about  or 
emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground
i was expecting knuckless digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding emeraldsamy  she isnt as fast as the above  characters but she still isnt a bad pick
although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringeinducing amy plays pretty well as she can attack with her massive hammere omega  alright
who expected a robot to be playable in a sonic game
i certainly havent but im glad i am
omegas gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry as well as being able to hover later on and do certain tasks in the levels
in final egg for example you must destroy sonic dolls
in emerald coast you catch froggy
in other levels you must go destoy other omega robots
i absolutely love playing as this thing as much as i love playing as the first  charactersbig  big is a pretty lame downside to this game
hes slow and you have to go fishing for things
its as fun as described and i certainly dont want to go back to playing as him
sadly you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss perfect chaos sothat pretty much covers up the characters
as for everything else the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted
plus the graphics are awesome for the time and the soundtrack rockshowever sonic adventure is not without flaws
the cutscenes arent amazing and while the story is nicely done some bits of dialogue are a bother thats a chaos emerald
 says knuckles as  chaos emeralds have been spotted
oh yeah and theres big the cat
nevertheless these are of course minor problems as the game is so much fun that youd hardly think about themsonic adventure is the best game on dreamcast and the game in the world
i love all sonic games this is great
the fastest on dreamcast
a sega dreamcast classicmost game go to d and are horrible but this was a great game
when i saw it i bought the dreamcast just for this game
all the launch units were sold out  so it was a bit of a wait
but looking back at it  this why we are gamers
it reminded me of being a kid againthis is an awesome game
the graphics are the best that have ever been on any sega system
it has an interesting story and you can play as a few of the old sonic characters from the tv series and the comic
you can even play as super sonic which looks awesome in these graphics
this game will keep you hooked even after you beat it because you will be wanting to do all the levels untill you get all the emblems for beating the level in certain waysi used to play only this game as a kid and i still love it today
the story line is cool and thought out
only draw back is you have to is through the cut scenesand they can be kind of long sometimesthe rest of the gameplay and plot and story connecting is really great though
the game is going on  years old and for that much time to pass and it still be just as fun to me as any game today that says somethingno the graphics arent amazing the voice acting is not amazing the gameplay is not the most intuitive and the camera angleslets face it are just plain horrible through most of the game
all that being said it is still a piece of dreamcast history and sonic history as well
a real segasonic fan would have this gameloved this game
i was hooked on it for some time after first buying it
really liked the sort of freedom sonic had in this game
the missions and levels that sonic played in are fun and keeps you wanting to play it for longer
loved the control of sonic loved the graphics
overall its an awesome addition to the sonic series
recommended game for people that have the dreamcastfirst off ive been a sonic fan for  years
ive played sonic heros sonic    sonic and knuckles sonic chaos sonic blast sonic labyrinth sonic d blast sonic drift dr robotniks mbm shadow the hedgehog sonic unleashed sonic colors sonic generations sonic rush sonic dash and sonic cd
ive also played this game sonic adventure
this game was the best selling game on the dreamcast
i definetely see why
great camera angles great platforming great speed great graphics good voice acting acceptional cutscenes its perfect
if you want a great d sonic game get this one
its also on gamecube xbox live marketplace and playstation network store
i dont care what you get it on just get it
its certainly a  out of   out of  golden game im not as big a sonic fan as i was in the past but i certainly love this game no matter whati thought that console gaming had reached its height with zelda  since then no game has really impressed me for the n
sure perfect dark and zelda majoras mask were great but nothing could touch zelda  then last weekend i received dreamcast as a confirmation gift along with a memory pack required if you want to save your game and i think u do and sonic adventure
now folks i was a huge fan of sonic back in his glory days with the genesis which reached its peak with sonic  needless to say playing gave me a true sense of nostalgiawell within minutes i was hooked to sonic adventure
the graphics are absolutely amazing
the level design is the best that i have ever seen
i love how sonic team chose to incorporate some rpg elements by including an overworld and some powerup items
what takes this game from great to being a true phenomenon is the playability of  characters
i got the game on thursday and beat the sonic quest saturday night thats not all though
i still have  more characters each with his or her own quests and storylines
tails and knuckles are among the playable characterstake the numerous quests and throw in some minigames and you have a game that will give you  hours of gameplaydont get me wrong sa has its flaws
the most noticable is the sometimes awkward camera angles
however the good outweighs the bad  to  and sa is a musthave for any dreamcast owneroverall sonic adventure was a great game to introduce me to my dreamcast
go out and buy sonic adventuresure there are other games out there that have been turned from their d incarnations to d adventures but none have been too successful in keeping that same feeling of whats most important funfactor
yeah super mario  on n was a great game and all but it didnt retain the same aspects as the previous d mario games and many gamers felt it was a much different experience than the other ones especially without marios brother luigi
however in sonic adventure you get that good ol feeling along with all of sonics best friends that youve known to love not to mention a few new surprises here and there
one of the coolest features is the voiceacting
you can have it play in english or japanese
what other game does that
it also supports  different languages in text english japanese german french and spanish or you can turn off the text
each of the levels are beautifully rendered in wonderful colors and sonics speed reminds you how large each stage really is
the lost world action stage is one of the best stages out there in gaming
to go with its great graphics new ideas in where you perform multiple tasks even get chased indiana jonesstyle by giant boulder this ones on fire
 the music is triplea aaa quality
actually most of sonic adventures music is aaa
there are initially five characters to choose from the start of the game and then six super sonic after you complete the original five starters adventures
super sonics adventure takes each of the components from the other five chaos emeralds master emerald flashbacks characters and you are there to witness the final showdown with the games ultramenace chaos only now theres something gone terribly wrong
chaos has used up the  emeralds powers to transform into perfect chaos
robotnik eggman sonic and his pals all team up to take him
bring it onthe game is amazing
i love shodan the plot voice acting
system shock  is a pure gem
the only problem with it is that since its old you cant really play it without issues or play it at all on new computers
i really hope to see this exact game being remastered not butchered and edited
id love to see new graphics on it and of course play it again to feel the old good terror
remember how halo combat evolved was remastered into halo anniversary
it was the same game with better sounds and newer graphics everything else was the same
i wish someone would already make a newer version of this gamewhy cant there be more games like this
system shock  is a oneofakind scifihorror game that is a mix between a stealth action game and an rpg
it defies conventional definitions for games and that is why i doubt i will ever play another one like it
i have played some creepy games before eg
thief arx fatalis but i have never played one before that hit me this hard with a combination of atmosphere and storyline
you can have nightmares about this game thanks to its disturbing imagery dark storyline and eerie soundsthe entire game takes place on a huge spaceship  trillion miles from earth
when i say huge i mean huge
the ship has gigantic areas for engineering medical treatment crew quarters a command center and an athletic facility
there is even a virtual sex booth in a shopping mall
you really get the feeling that you are walking around a ship that was once inhabited by thousands of busy crew members
i say once because something has gone terribly wrong and it is up to you to find out what has happened and escape with your lifeas you play you uncover pieces of the storyline in voice messages that have been left behind by the ships crew members
with a few exceptions the voice acting for the game is terrific
they start off somewhat chilling and by the end they get downright scary
you follow storylines for individual crew members many times to their grim demise
i found myself hoping that a character would survive the game only to find her dead later
also an surviving ally guides you through the game with email messages
by listening to the messages you also get clues for the games puzzles which are generally very easy to solve
all the while you are alone defending yourself against the hideous force that has hijacked the ship
terrifying is an appropriate word to use here
system shock  does not rely on scripted events and cheap tricks to scare you
instead it is scary in an alfred hitchcock way
you are frightened by what you dont know is there and by what you cant see
you find the corpses of the ships crew scattered about and you never get used to them
even when there are no enemies in the room you feel like you are only a splitsecond from demise
the brilliant use of sound in this game is one reason why the game is so successful at this
when you stand still you can hear enemies moaning or chattering around the corner or perhaps approaching you from behindthis game is not just a simple alien bug hunt
stealth is key and survival is very hard
the game has an extensive and sometimes confusing roleplaying system that gives you a variety of ways to develop and equip your character
in addition there are about a hundred gadgets and goodies to pick up and use for survival
the roleplaying system has some faults though
one is that certain skills like hacking are too overpowered compared to others like psionics
you cant survive the game without a good hacking skill
also there are contrivances in the game that seem to be there to force you to buy certain skills
for example weapons are absurdly fragile so you have to learn the repair and maintain skills to use them
i like the roleplaying aspects but deus ex is better in that departmentthe graphics for the game have aged very well with one exception  faces on the characters
they basically look blocky and polygon counts for enemies are generally low
other than that the environments in the game are very convincing and immersive
rooms are usually dark but filled with computer consoles and gizmos that flash and beepthe first half of the game is incredibly hard and frustrating and requires continuous use of the quick save and quick reload keys
this in fact is why i didnt finish the game until two years after i bought it
the storyline is what keeps you going during the frustrating times
my recommendation is to buy the game play it and stick with it
system shock  is definitely an acquired taste
once you get to like it i think that you will consider it to be one of the best scifihorror games ever madei bought this game about a year ago played it for one day and for some reason stopped playing it
i guess it just didnt appeal to me that day
i finished halflife a few days ago and was looking for something else to entertain me but i didnt think anything was going to satisfy me as much as halflife did
i reinstalled system shock  and decided to give it another trybest thing i ever did
and as a matter of fact this has become one of my all time favorite games i have ever played and some might call me crazy but i find this game to be far better than halflifethe graphics are excellent and the sounds are top notch
you really feel as if you are part of this doomed spacecraft
things jump out at you and pieces of debris come flying at and down on top of you which has caused me to jump out of my seat a few timesthe interface is very easy to work with and youll have it mastered in no timethere are different approaches you can take throughout the game
some of my favorite things are modifying weapons and hacking into security computers and vending machinesi could go on and on about this game but theres no need to just read the other reviews and you know that this game is great
i highly recommend it to anyonemany people may not know this but bioshock was stated by the games creator to be a spiritual successor to system shock this game is amazing you should totally buy it i really love this game and i wish there could be a  too this cause it deserves one
this game is really really scary but it is worth the moneysystem shock  is hard to categorize because it blends several genres and styles of games so well
its a roleplaying firstperson shooter science fiction survivalhorror game with some extra twists here and there
if you wished halflife was more like deus ex or you wanted to play the more violent and scary parts of thief with nd century firepower this is the game you want to playthough its getting a bit dated now this game was far enough ahead of its time to still be very playable
where the original system shock made history as a remarkably immersive storydriven firstperson shooter the sequel goes even further with complex character development elements usually only seen in roleplaying games
the graphics scale up smoothly enough to still look impressive on todays faster higher resolution and higher polygon count displays the sound is of sufficient quality to still be just as effective as most newer more technically advanced productions and of course a great story is never obsoleteonce you get into a game this immersive you forget about the technical details that may no longer be as cuttingedge as they once were
just turn off the lights plug in your headphones or surroundsound if you have it and try to stay alive
if you happen to forget that its just a game this one can really scare you
definitely not for the faint of heartthe biggest flaw in this game is that the developers just didnt have enough time to fully fleshout and polish some of the later parts
certain areas are just less expansive and detailed and finelytuned than others
the game doesnt significantly suffer from whats missing
it just could have been that much betterby far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast
personally i dont consider that a flaw
i like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons
unlike most firstperson shooters your resources are very limited in this game
throughout most of the game you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count
there are a limited number of weapons available and if you keep firing one until it jams you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work withif you really dont like worrying about broken weapons there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration
its not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game but the release notes file on the cd explains how to do it and its not difficultone complaint ive heard about the end of this game is that there are two final battles at the end and the second one is disappointingly easy
i didnt feel that way because i recognized that the first final battle was the climax and then when there was one more confrontation after that i thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge
this is something gamers just arent used to and the only other game ive played that had an epilogue after the final confrontation was halflife which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever
the ending of system shock  isnt nearly that bad but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting moreunfortunately due to the particular circumstances of the closing of the company that developed the game looking glass studios it is very unlikely that there will ever be a third system shock gamewhen i played this game my hands were actually sweating from the suspense
the story is quite entertaining with some predictable and surprising twists in the plot
this game allows you to play as a marine weapons osi
psionicsmind power or navy cyberneticscomputers
each branch has its corresponding strengths but having superior computer skills make the game somewhat easier to proceed through the challenging levels
there are lots of high tech weaponry and gadgets throughout the eerie decks of the von braun including a red lights district in the crews recreational area
it was more fun for me to solve the levels myself rather than resorting to online walkthroughs
if you enjoyed halflife and thief then youll have a great time with system shock system shock  is most likely the scariest game i have ever played halflife being the only close contender
as good as hl is though ss tops it with more storyline and depth and personality
im an rpg fan and id consider ss more of an action game than an rpg but the game still allows you to configure your character in ways that deeply affect the gameplay
first time through i played as a psionics guy who wielded handtohand weapons
late in the game i was able to use an invisibility psi power run up to enemies and whack the bejeezus out of them
i didnt have to use guns much and when i did i just used the cheesy little pistol
next time i play im going to specialize in guns and be a longdistance sniper
the roleplaying elements are not that deep but i still greatly appreciate the opportunity to choose how my character develops
thats why this game is better than halflifei tried to go back and play the original system shock while i was playing this game and even though i had played and loved the original when it came out i found the interface way too annoying now to play it
in system shock  the graphics are much much better and the interface is nice and clean  very configurable and fairly easy to use even when i was juggling psi powers and healing hypos while backing away from an enemyi only have a couple complaints about the game loading times were annoyingly long  one and a half to two minutes
this made the difficult sections where i died a lot tough to slog through
also there was one place where i had to use a walkthrough because even though i had the ingame gamma correction turned up all the way i still couldnt see a passageway i had to go through
i had to turn up the brightness on my monitor to find it
youre probably thinking quotno duh dummyquot but i like to play with a low brightness level makes the game extra scary at night and i was able to see everything fine except for this one area
a minor point though  in general the level design was linear but goodi think i had a nightmare about the cyborg assassins in this game  the sign of a truly cool and frightening enemy
if you like halflife or first person shooters in general but would like something a little meatier that lets you have an inventory and customizable stats ss is for youafter playing and enjoying bioshock although not enough to warrent repeat playthroughs i looked at what the developers have previously done and came across this little gem and basically this affirms my case where better graphics does not mean a better gamewhere bioshock was underwater this one takes place in space i never played the first one but the storyline for this one seemed to fall into place
when you start out you can choose different talents to use i chose nice and simple guns before starting the actual game
when you start in the game everything has turned into hell basically think event horizon and you try to get from one point of the ship to another and find an escape pod meeting a few suprises along the waywhere bioshock was like colorful nautical fun system shock  is a terrifying struggle for survival bullets are limited enemies are powerful if you play on hard like a man and you basically choose fightorflight a great staple in survival horror that most modern survival horror games cannot grasp
although the graphics are dated the threat is still present the noises made are chilling and as a veteran to horror games i had chills go down my spine multiple times as some unholy abomination lumbered closer and closer and all i have is a wrench to protect myself
the background story is wonderfully hinted at with snippets and audio logs similar to bioshock and some of the most horrifying stuff in the game happens offscreen setting up a tense dreadfilled atmosphere rivaling that of silent hill if theres one complaint i have about this game i wish you could interact a bit more with other survivors at least in the first part
all you really see is a woman running away then getting shot and it wouldve been interesting having someone to work with a little but its a minor thing and the desolate feeling of being the only character works well in system shock s favor if you liked bioshock and arent a stickler for graphics i recommend you find this game whever you can and give it a whirlif you loved halflife this is a must buy
i am not a big fpshooter fan but ss like halflife combines a great story with an incredibly immersive atomsphere
if you have yet to play quake and its clones do not  bother buying them start with this one
not for the those wary of the  macabrethis game is great
the sound is terrific the graphics are good and the interface is very easy to use
the best thing about it is the creepy feeling you get when you play it
try it with the lights out late at night when no one is home
one minor problem that novice players should  note
this game can be very hard
if you are used to quaketype games be  prepared to change your style of play
the guns in this game degrade and  break very quickly and there isnt that much ammo to go around anyway
you  should find other ways to get around this problem
it is more realistic in  a sense because who in the hell is going to want to take on all of these  zombies and killer robots anyway
part of the fun is avoiding and getting  away from these nasty monsters
other than the difficulty factor this game  is near perfectlgs stands for looking glass studios
the company has closed down last may
it is sad to see an innovative company being shutdown because the games they make are innovative and intelligentsystem shock  is one example
codeveloped with irrational games which has its root with lgs  this game uses the famous dark engine used in games like thief and thief   this engine is one of its kind   the physics is realistics you throw a  box up on a slope and you can see it sliding down slowly you stack a few  crates and pull away the lower ones and the rest drop and tumbles   the  ai is smart each critters has eyes and ears and therefore react to sight  and sound
yeap they can hear where you are
unlike many games which cheat  by letting the creatures knwo where you are this game simulates the real  thing
 sound i think i need not describe how incredible the sound  effect music and digitised speech this game produces
you can read from  all the players reviews
it gives so much atmosphere that i shudder to  think what the next version of the engine is going to be like
its sad  that the company has closedthere are games that make their mark most recently half life but ss steals its crown for me
for any fps or adventure fanreal time strategy this is a cut above the rest
the plot is amazing and left me half way  through the game gasping yes you know the bit
the progression of your  character with various traits is a steop above half life
it may not have  the shoot em up feel to it as hl but the thinking and realism is  compelling
it took me about a week to complete but this was solid every  evening   it did take over my social time wondering what will happen next   its that good
the dark engine is looking well but will probably look  dated soon and the atmosphere created is untrue
the ability to build on  certain strengths should be built into future games of thie genre
its a  new thing which works brilliantly
you could go back and complete it using  a differnt trait and uncover skills you never before
the interface is cool  as is the sounds
i cannot fault this game every gamer should own this   if your reading this stop and buy it now
looking glass   youve given us  an all time classica solidly good sequel to the classic original system shock  was one of the most engrossing games of  and had me playing it well into the early hours
its not quite as good as the original  or for that matter  the same teams thief the dark project but its still very good
the  good things are legion  it has the same scary atmosphere as the original  with you as the lone survivor of an unexpected catastrophe on board an  unfamiliar space vessel
the interior is wrecked bodies litter the floor  mutant zombie people are attacking you and some areas of the ship have  been overtaken by an icky fungus
the later sequences in which you  discover the nature of the problem and team up with a strange ally  contain some of the most effective goes at telling a story in a computer  game without resorting to having pages of text and  or dialogue
the game  itself is much as the original  search everything in sight whilst shooting   and the thiefesque engine whilst not pretty can do stealth and ai at  least as effectively as halflife
the game has a great cool crisp  atmosphere to it toothe downsides
as i have said its not pretty
the whole character generation system is almost completely pointless  and as you play you realise that firepower is infinitely more important  than cunning
and the fmv sequences are simply terrible  the ending  sequence in particular is totally outofplace
most abstract of all the  downbeat grim tone gets to you after a while but thats not really a  fault of the game
having your guns break over time seems a bit excessively  realistic too alhough a patch fixes this and the last quarter or so  seems rushed
these are quibbles thoughstill i felt extremely sad  when i realised that i had almost finished and after spending three days  finishing the thing it took me  hours i immediately played it againthis game is the perfect example of what videogames can acomplish to become a truly gripping experience
this game was as well developed as any book or movie with excelent use of moody setting and diverse  imaginative gameplay this is truly an unforgettable experience
in a similar way that prior games like quest for glory there were  different career paths that  made the game a unique experience to each class the integration of the different skills to the storyline made it almost like  different games
besides the tremendous gameplay the main thing that set this game apart for me was the great atmosphere everything here is just right the monsters are scary and have their own distinct sound effects that can help you spot them before thay are actually in front of you i recall many jump ou of your seat moments while moving along cleared levels only to hear a cry of die or kill me while beign hit from behind with a pipe
the tragic stories of the crewmembers unforld via audiologs that really made them more than another faceless npc i remember the chilling audiologs telling the tale of creation the first nanny and then meeting her afterwardsi enjoy first person shooters but as humbling online experiences have shown me i dont have the necesary skills to compete with the top tier human opponents but bots and monsters in fps are fun and anyway this game didnt require that much mouse skills
over the years modders have made some pretty impresive graphic packs to try to make the game a bit more palatable for modern gamers but considering its age the gameplay is still as rock solid as ever
i  truly feel this is a must play game for anyone who the slightest bit interested in crpgs or pc games in generalthis is without any doubt the best scifi rpg ever and i mean ever made
and its so scary that the first many hours you play it cold sweat will run down you neck
its in d and its in my oppinion the only rpg that  gets away with that
and the sound is so great and sooooo scary that some  times you wish you never loaded the game
even if the game costs  it  was still worth the moneymy favorite thing about ssii is that it tells a coherent story that makes sense
every action you take in ssii is motivated by a desire to accomplish a clearlystated objective
goals are not assigned arbitrarily either and are extremely wellexplained by the superb voice acting
when you accomplish a mission you are rewarded with access to more areas of the ship and new missions to accomplishanother great aspect of this game is the way it flows
there are no levels other than levelsdecks within the ship you are trying to escape from and accomplishing certain objectives means traversing multiple decksthere are times when this game is extremely scary
its designed to frighten you and at times it accomplishes this goal very well
the music is mostly techno but its scary techno
that might not make sense to you but trust me it can be very intimidating at timesif you havent played the original system shock read up on its plot before you play this game
the background information you gain will help you out a lotoverall this is on my top ten alltimenow i love pc and console role playing games as well as pc shooters
so when i found out about this game years ago i was in heaven
the game is a great mix of first person shooter role playing and horror
things come at you from around the corner and the very ship youre on is out to get you
awesome
since it came out years ago its able to play on even the lowest spec computer
graphics may not be up with todays realistic junk but who cares this game will scare the crap out of youthere still arent that many dreamcast games out than can be called quotmusthavesquot but quothouse of the dead quot is definitely one of them
but do you need the gun to play it
yes
otherwise it will be  nowhere near as much fun and almost impossible to beat it as the monsters  are often zipping all over the screen at great speed
the game is  extrememly hard anyway even set on the quotvery easyquot level 
  and the first few times you play it you will be killed long before the  final battle but the game would be over far too quickly if it were easy
the feel good factor from final victory however is always worth waiting  for
every aspect of the graphics is fantastic the zombies are incredibly  detailed especially in close up and the backgrounds are beautifully  realised
replay value comes from the many different paths you can take  through the zombieinfested town
these paths depend on the speed and  accuracy of your shooting and you will enjoy replaying the game to try and  hit those tricky targets and save the innocent civilians some of which  are extremely difficult to rescue
also added is quotoriginal modequot  in which you build up a store of powerups and lifeups and even some  bizarre different weapons and charactermodifiers that appear in secret  spots in the course of the game
you really need a vmu for this mode  although you can enjoy the arcade game without one there are no save  points during gameplay
add to this the training exercises and you have  an arcade experience that is not only transported identically into your  living room but also enhanced with many extras
the game is above all fun  to play as it requires no serious investment of time or thought
you can  pick it up at any time and start blasting the undeadthere is something magical about this game
everytime you play it you will surely enjoy it
the graphics on dreamcast are better smoother faster more stable than those on pc
i cant wait until i get my dreamcast pistol light gun and try it with this game
i played the game on arcade machines for years and finished it many times i really enjoyed every single moment
after that i got it on pc and it was a good experience with a pc light gun like the sega automag
finally i got it for dreamcast
i enjoyed the player game with my friends
but i am sure that the maximum and ultimate fun will be playing the game with the dreamcast pistol light gun
highly recommended classic
get it now and you will know what the word quotfunquot meansi own house of the dead on the sega saturn not to mention the third one for xbox and this sequel proved to be worth the wait for me
this game lined up with jet grind radio sonic adventure and sonic adventure  in my great dreamcast collection and those are the best games in my dreamcast collection
i read the reviews before buying it though and i noticed that quite a few people were mentioning how crappy the game was without the light gun
so i bought the light gun for my dreamcast just for this game and it is worth it
the graphics are awesome just like the others even though the voice acting is one of the worst ive heard in a video game
i havent tried the game with the controller ive only spent my times playing with the gun so read other peoples reviews if you want to get the idea
the savethehostages thing is also really cooli still havent completed the game with rescuing all of the hostages argh
so frustrating
 but you can easily set your game to easy medium or hard
its much better than the first one you can tell from the graphics to the game play and right down to the light gun compatibility house of the dead  has it allhofd is awesomeits very violent and gory which is why i love itit was a very popular game when it came to the arcades butnow you can play this blessing game any time you want at yourown homethis is one of dream cast strong holds before it lost its popularity in the usthis game is excelent for dreamcast ownersother games of choicesonic adventuresword of berserkspawnin the demons handsoul caliburif you have a dc go out and get this game
it rockslateri love shooting games and hod ii is the reason that i purchased a dreamcast rather than waiting for the psx   hod ii continues on from the original as you are part of a team of government agents once again trying to stop a zombie creating madman
you shift from screen to screen using the sega light gun to blow away various bad guys as they charge at you
depending on how and who you shoot the game branches off through various pathsthe graphics are spectacular nearly identical to the arcade
the sound is also good except for the ridiculously silly sounding boss monsters why do they sound like they have swallowed helium
the dc version also has great additional features  boss mode puzzle levels and target practicethe biggest problems with the game besides the goofy voices is that the gun calibration seems to be a little off and the game can become almost too hard to be fun is some areasoverall i was really looking forward to this game and i was not disappointeddynamite cop is short but its fun
its even more of a blast with a friend or sibling
the graphics are good for this type of game and the sound is also cool
the choice of characters is decent  to be exact and the action is fast and furious
the game has only  downfalls  its short and  basically easy
an option to adjust difficulty settings would have been funtoo bad thet there were not enough beat em ups for the dreamcast because these are my favourite type of games
dynamite cop is apprecieated and is worth it if you like these kind of action gamespsthe presidents daughter is buck ugly
they could have brushed up on that aspect a littleits games like these that make us nerds love the dreamcastdynamite cop was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day and this version brings those memories flooding back you could call this a perfect port which is something the dreamcast has always been very good at
if youre like me and ran to the arcade to play this back when it was around youll love this version too
definite recommendationto those who havent played before you choose from one of three secret agents and fight your way through a pirateinfested cruise ship
i hesitate to call it appropriate for all ages as there are scary moments gunfire and explosions but as long as your kiddies arent averse to that its pretty tame and never gory
but other than that this is arcade beatemup action at its finestthis game will keep you occupied for hours
better than zombie revenge this game has awesome bone and joint breaking grab techniques that are very innovative and fun to use
the plot may seem like a repetition of die hard arcade replaced with crazy pirates but it still is a lot of funi thought with playstations madden  i had the only football game id need for years
but when my brother got the game cube playstation  and xbox he gave me his dreamcast and a few games along with it nfl k being one of them
turns out this is a great game
the graphics are good and game play is as good as anything on playstation
you can force trades to create your dream team and while you cant play a franchise you can save your season
the passing game is a little easy bu it makes up by making a tougher running game
and lik most of dream casts sports games it is well done and fun
would i pick this over madden 
probably not but it is a nice addition and the two games are fun to own togetherquite possible the very best football game that ever existed
simple controls and amazing graphics this game was surely ahead of its timenfl k is a one of the most realistic game for the dreamcast
the game is pretty much a mix of hardcore football with fun arcade
first off i would recommend getting a mega block memory cardthey have around  blocks cause the game uses up  blocks of memory
but you can call the your plays with out no one knowing on the vmu
this is truly one of the funniest games i have ever played
i would said the greatest strength of the game is the graphics
theyre not fuzzed out or miss colored in any way
they are very solid and rich
game also has  motion captured moves
the sound is amazing its truly is one of the best sounded games i have ever played
the has  detailed courses play editor fantasy draft ect
nfl k does have some d art but isnt to the point were it bugs to death
i would highly recommend the game to anyone who is a football fanthis game has the best graphics of any sports game ive ever seen and its extremely fun to play against a friend one on one
when playing in cold weather each players breath can be seen which is just one of the awesome things youll see here
a drawback is that you cant play a franchise mode like on madden  and this is a must now for diehard football gamers
nfl k is better than madden  despite having less features because it simply feels more real
in madden  use the instant replay on pass receptions to see just how comical it looks when a pass just drops into a receivers body without his hands moving or his eyes focused on the ball
it looks as though you will not find this type of blocky and sometimes unrealistic gameplay on the dreamcast
on nfl k instant replays reveal true onehanded catches balls going right through a receivers outstretched hands and other types of situations that look real
the running game in nfl k could use a little improvement but overall this game is just pure fun and reality for anyone who enjoys playing football video gamesi think the now defunct sega dream cast has some of the best sports games out there nfl k virtua tennis etc and nba k is no exception
the graphics and game play are great
i think this is the best basketball game ive come acrossthis game is amazing the graphics the game is also pretty easy to play once you get the hang of itthis game is by far the best basketball game on the market today forget nba showtime forget any n basketball games put them away and get nba k you will see how much better this game is than all the wannabes out there in the marketrealistic energetic fast moving great graphics challenging and enjoyablethis is an awesome game of the 
well its about time a system made a game for allen iverson
who is far more better than kobe bryant and with the stats to prove it
its just that allen iverson doesnt have a perfect team like kobe as everyone of kobes team mates are better than the average nba playeranyways this game has alley oops great graphics graphics are especially good in nba games cuz it just looks weird when the graphics are bad in nba games and also if you watch the sport on tv you can tell whos who and find the better person faster without using direct pass
  the rosters are accuarate no fake rosters such as quotroster quot like the nba lives series
all players are actual playershere are a few things you can do in nba kalley oopsdirect passcross overcreate own playercreate own teamand also when u create a player you cant have him perfect which i think is actually a good thing so the game wont be too easy
and when you make your own team the names are set for you allowing the announcer to say the name which makes it less confusing i was confused when me and my friend played nba live  on computer and both made custom teamshopefully a system will make a wnba game soon though cuz tina thompson is hotti was one of the many who bought dreamcast on the day it was released and along with the system i also bought four games nfl k ready to rumble boxing soulcaliber and house of the dead   about a month later i got nba k my expectations were high because nfl k was so good
well i have to tell you ive had this game for over a year now and i still cant stop playing it
everything about nba k is so accurate and well presented that i keep coming back for more
the gameplay is phenomenal so life like that you sometimes feel as if your watching a game on tv rather than playing it
there are also great options including season mode trades fantasy drafts and create a player modes
the only negative thing i can say about this game is that in almost every game a player gets injured which is annoying
but other than that this game has great replay value and is a great addition to any sega dreamcast collectionthis is a fun version of the board game
its true to the original and adds animations music and a great d first person perspective of traveling over the board
like the board game its a great family game
i highly recommend iti used to play the board version at my wifes parents house when i first dated her  years ago
when we went shopping for a few games for our new computer  years ago found this along with some of our other favoritesgreat fun and a hoot to play
the best thing is that being computerized takes care of the manual administrative things like counting money
the same goes for similar games like monopoly and the graphics and cartoons are really entertaining
nice is that you can play with as many as  or  human players so everyone can get in
either way you play is greatexcellent game and like other board games that translate to computer a must have and great funwow this has got everything
more options weapons levels and loads more than was offered previously
i first picked up the original worms when it came out back in  it featured the song quotwormsongquot which is where the above quote comes from and i own every edition that has been released since and lemme tell you this is the biggest baddest least flawed edition of them allalthough ive never been a fan of the cartoony graphics compared with those in worms and worms reinforcements they are much smoother and slicker
the copious amounts of voice packs are hilarious and you can add your own
the menu isnt windows based like worms  and a real improvement is that you can jump higher as well
add to that the ability to backflip which is very usefuloverall the only thing lacking in this are the single player missions that are in reinforcements but even then theyre replaced by training levels which help increase skills such as aiming bazookas and shotguns using the ninja rope accurately placing grenades etcso basically buy this game
good by yourself even better multiplayer
nothing beats a load of other people crowding round your computer screen while you kick their buttsall the worms games are fun games
the great part about the worms games is you can play with a group of friends or alone against the computerthe fact that you can play a quick game or sit and play for hours makes it a great valuedont be fooled by the silly premise of this game
this is arguably one of the best turnbased strategy games around
with loads of options and weapons and randomly generated maps this game has nearinfinite replay  value
the multiplayer is perhaps the best part
it is always more fun to  play live opponents in this type of game
an added bonus is that this game  will play well even on low end systems
if you are a fan of this type of  game and have not played it you just cannot go wrong with worms  armageddonthis game is lots of fun
the gameplay itself really hasnt changed much even from the original title but lots more options have been added the cartoons are more comical and quotspunkyquot theres a lot more  choices
the worms are still their evercute selves
cute new weapons like  skunk bow and arrow exploding worm have been added to increase its  playability
if you want to buy one out of the three game series make it  this onehaving problems with a game look no further for a solution on how to fix things by getting this to help even the scorethis has to be the ultimate cheating device for the nintendo i had one when i was much younger but i got rid of it because it had a freezing problem
that was a mistake this is the only cheating device i know of that allows you to actually create your own codesnow ive read that some people are complaining that it doesnt always work
here are two possible reasons  theyre using the wrong version of a game  the game cartridge is not securely attached to the gamesharkif youre unsure of your games version you can easily find out by selecting the new game option on the game menu
you should see a detect game option select it and the games title and version should appear
anyhow using it is simple just choose the cheats for the game you want to play
you can get cheats online if you dont want to make cheats yourself which is what i would recommend if youre like me and dont know a thing about hackingwarning do not remove the game from the gameshark for any reason while the nintendo is on
if you do you could damage the gameshark and maybe even your game if youre already playing it
what happens is this the game that was removed will work but the other games will only cause it to freezeif this happens you can try this insert the game that was incorrectly removed then activate cheats for another game and start playing
of course the codes wont work but turn the nintendo off and then try another game
this isnt a  guarantee though so just be careful with the removal of your gameskiller graphics
super internet play
this is twice what mechwarrior was mechwarriorif you must buy this please get the expanion game also you will not be disappointedthis game jams up my wifes computer and her internet  service so much they kick me offthis game makes me wish i had a sdsl modem  linethis game really kicksthough a bit old mw is still the best
the campaign is fun great overall mood and atmosphere combined with two tracks from a little known music group known as twisted tenderness haze and make it happen
the music is limited but darn goodthe real fun of mw is online gameply where you must outplay outgun and most importantly outdesign your opponents
the mechlab where you go to customize your multiton mech is admitadly unrealistic allowing the player to place multi weapons on a mech chasis obviously not made to have certain weapons in certain places but its also one of the most enjoyable aspects with it you can place insane amounts of misilles or the dreaded ultra autocannon  on each arm or torso sideit takes a bit of ingenuity to outwit the many other oline players when it comes to design for design is ultimately what kills or gets you killed
to do so you must balance weapons armor armor type chasis type engine and equipement to devise the most lethal mech you canand hope its better than your opponentsthe unfortunate aspect of online gaming is of course the lag factor
often you must shoot several mech lengths ahead of your opponent to actually hit them which can be very annoying
but if you can suppress your ego long enough to master this irritatiing quirk suffer many defeats and learn what it takes to survive the online world of mw it is awesome
the array of different weapons and equipment at your disposal the stunningly beautiful mech chasis in your arsenalive owned mechwarrior three for over two years now and i know i will always come back to it for moreto summarize the campaign is more than enough to justify buying this incredible game especially at its current price tag   and the online gaming rooms makes it worth twice the price
currently mechwarrior three is only played on two gaming services that i know of gamespy and the more popular msn gaming zone
and to further compliment the online experience there are maps called icemaps which reduce your weapons heat to nearly nothing readily available from different websites
they add a very fun aspect of insane destruction to you gameplay helping you to obliterate your enemies in a few well placed shotsin short mechwarrior  rocks and always willon a related note sadly this game is hard to find and even harder to find is its expansion pack pirates moon which gets a rating every bit as good as mw from this mechwarriornow man your mechs and prepare to dominate the battlefieldive had this game for years and always go back a play through from time to time summary fantastic flight model incredible depth of simulation amazing thoroughness of detail beautiful scenery fairly stable with  patch
also absolutely spellbinding on every level
the only jet fighter simulator better than this is classifiedwords simply cannot express the mindboggling excellence of this simulation or my level of satisfaction at finally buying installing and taking on its challengeim a reallife pilot with over  hours of small airplane flight time and i think its safe to say that ive got about  hours of flight time on classic sims such as f fa janes wwii fighters ef mig alley falcon  janes f strike eagle and fs
i started flying on an apple iie in  on the original microsoft flight simulator with a green screen monitor
aviation especially fighter aviation has been an obsession of mine since i was  years old
if your profile sounds anything like mine the simple truth is that falcon  is your holy grailin the earlier falcon  the people at spectrum holobyte pushed the outer limits of what the casual pc flyer could learn and do
in creating falcon  the team at microprose didnt just push those limits they rammed right through them like a durandal through runway concrete
be assured falcon  isnt a game
it is nothing less than a full blown recreation of nearly every significant function and capability of the general dynamics fc block  and of every sight sound and situation that the real life pilot of that aircraft would experience in wartime
name a system a weapon a readout a display a hud function a capability or a feature of the real f and the odds are about  that youll find it perfectly simulated in falcon   about the only thing this sim cant do is yank the blood down out of your brain and make your head weigh  pounds and im sure that only budget considerations stopped this worldclass team of software developers from finding a way to provide us with that experienceif all you want to do is ram the throttle forward punch holes in the sky and gun down the bad guys without having to think too much the excellent janes wwii fighters is the sim for you
if however you recognize that modernday fighter pilots are the ultimate high performance human beings who combine tactical combat knowledge with the ability to manage incredibly complex airplanes and systems under intense physical and mental stress and if taking on just the idea of that kind of challenge appeals to you buy falcon  right now before it disappears completely
the sad truth is that this sim is simply too good for  of its potential market  the average casual pc flyer will open the very well written  page manual and feel like a maverick has hit him or her in the noggin
usaf fighter pilots are some of the smartest brightest most overachieving people on the planet and to master falcon  thats pretty much who you will need to be as well
if youve got what it takes however the rewards are here  and i do mean all the rewards are here
everything
this is as good as pcbased jet fighter sims are ever going to benote this review applies to falcon  flown in campaign mode with avionics flight model and systems all set to realistic
if you just want to turn burn and heave missiles at things you can turn all that stuff down to easy enter the dogfight arena and have a blast
also the essential version  patch can be found at falconcom year of acid house and spectrum holobytes falcon st  amigagigantic and imposing falcon  is more or less the last word in ultrarealistic ultraanal combat flight simulators one which shot  itself in the foot
after half a decade in the making it came out two  years ago to variable reviews  most praised the stunning graphics the  realism and the campaign whilst bemoaning the monster pc required and the  mountain of bugs
nonetheless this is a product of quality and depth  something to which the passionate network of fan sites testifies
two years  later it still looks stunning the horizon stretches away seemingly  forever and only the chunky textures look dated
the newer patches  multimegabyte downloads all fix most of the bugs leaving the world with  a rockhard simulation of an f locked in combat with north koreaapart  from the ultrarealism just for example you dont just have to fly  waypoints  you have to do it on time the campaign mode sets it apart  from the competition  youre basically flying over a giant wargame one  that is played out in realtime even when youre selecting ammunition  loadouts and so on and your actions however small play a part in the  big picture
as you soar over the battlefield you watch explosions ripple  along the ground in the distance
the complexities involved in planning and  administering strike missions can be daunting  thankfully you dont have  to as you can just drop yourself into an existing missiondespite the  ability to tweak the realism this is still frighteningly complex to start  with even if youre a flight sim veteran
the relative antiquity of the  f compared to such scifi aircraft as the muchsimulated f  contributes to this  if youre expecting to just press t to hit the  nearest ground target youll be horrified at the array of radar modes  bombing crosshairs and the insanely strange way in which you cant just  press a button to drop a bomb  your fire control computer does that for  you
nonetheless once you start to get the hang of it its grippingas  in real life the other people fire back  and often your first warning  of an incoming missle will be a loud bang followed by a complete loss of  control a spin a radio voice announcing an incoming missile and a crash
its not fair but then again neither is real life
flying low over enemy  vehicles will get you shot to pieces and with  cannon rounds you cant  strafe them into oblivion
on the other hand i cant think of another sim  that lets you drop napalm over the enemyits interesting to compare it  to dids fiveyearold ef
that also had a clever campaign mode  although being set over norway it was mostly restricted to air and sea  units
dids simulations managed a balance between realism and playability  that fell on the latter end of the scalewhen i first received the package i open it as fast as possible
i inserted it in the system and played it for a few hours and enjoyed every minute
all the buttons worked so wonderfully i couldnt believe how much it played like the original
i could say to everybody if you want to relive the past buy this controller
you will never regret it in any wayshape or form
come on go buy itthis is the best controllertype setup that ive seen
the nicest thing about it is that all buttons are within easy reach of your thumbs
no handremoval here folks
sony was smart when they modeled their playstation controller after this one
with that in mind i feel that nintendo made a grave mistake with their n controller
that controller prefers analog over the digital buttons that are out of the way and not to mention its as big as your face
no the basic snes controller doesnt have turbo or anything like that but even the supersized one is small when compared to dreamcast and n controllersthe controller for the super nintendo is great
the size is perfect for anyone and the buttons can be easily reached by your thumbs
sony made a great decision by modeling their psx controllers after the super nintendos controllers
if you are looking for a controller with turbo or a a fancier controller with a joystick and a different feel this is not the controller you want
but if you want a standard controller for you super nintendo this is the controller you want to getby buying this controller from amazoncom you will be making the right choicewith all of the new systems continuously coming out you may not be able to find a controller for your super nintendo in stores for much longermy son likes to shop on here all the time
so far everything he has purchased works fine including this joypadthey work great and have a good length cord
the buttons arent stiff but they arent touchy either
just rightfirst off it isnt a firstparty made by nintendo controller and there is nothing on the packaging or on the controller itself that screams nintendo  so dont look for it
all you need to know is that this controller works perfectly just like the original controller
lots of people have given this controller negative reviews but i cant figure out why other than because they expect it to function and feel just like an original controller
pfheh
granted the l and r buttons click and the plastic feels cheap as long as you can pull off moves in your favorite games thats all that matters
and this controller definitely deliversthis controller does its job  the dpad seems a little flimsy and the diagonals are not that strong however its better than most and comes at a fair pricei was hesitant to get this program
i am not a frequent fan of scrabble and felt that their earlier incarnations were subpar
the s was just black and white and the deluxe version didnt take advantage of the technology both are dos
the windows version before this came close but resetting your color settings was annoying
this new version blows all previous versions out of the water
finally a choice of board views slant or up and you can still easily read the word score tiles on the topside view my favorite and if you have the right soundboard you will hear an orchestra of stupendous music
please treat yourself to a soundboard like the turtle beach santa cruz it is fabulous
of course if you prefer you can turn off the music
you have three choices of board styles a much better selection of background art no more dark and dreary somber backgrounds like the last version
and a more realistic selection of replacement tiles just like playing for real
you can also select autopick or have the computer autopick for you
scrabble fans must have wrote in with suggestions on improving the game i hope
and it looks like theyve listened
i hope they listen to that disappointed player who said they couldnt get tech support for it
i saw a patch for it at hasbrointeractivecom but i think the patch solves mainly multiplayer issues and not the ones the disappointed player has
i sincerely hope the problems for that person are resolved as this is a great game giving you more choices more realistic play and is greatly entertainingscrabble cdrom is the game that we all grew up with but updated so that you can play on your computer
there are  different skill levels and you can play many different type games including classic scrabble against the computer other players up to  tournaments online and special new mini gamesthe best way is to challenge quotmavenquot the computer opponent
you can chose his skill level and increase it as you progress
the game also contains a dictionary so there is no arguing over which words are realto help you there is a cheathint code in the game that you can take advantage of when you are stucki have a sony vaio computer running windows xp and i had no trouble installing and playing this game
scrabble cd rom is the classic game but made modern and more funthis game is terrific
i love being able to play against others online
that feature basically just makes this whole game worth while to me
for a game like scrabble this has very good graphics
the dictionary feature is  very useful as wellthis is a great game for those rainy days and where  i live there are a lot of them once you get the game to play this maybe the best translation of a board game to the pc
game play is good and as a longtime scrabble player it is really convienent not to have to look for pieces and draw tiles manually
plus being able to save games in progressone word of warning  if you have trouble clicking to start menus like i did turn off your main word processor program before you load and run scrabble
that helpful hint came from the hasbro web page faq
in addition they have patches and upgrades available
after having returned games twice to the store i discovered this trick and i didnt have to run the mouse over the screen to erase the old menu to get to the new oneall in all hasbro does a really good job translating their board games on to the pc
i recommend that if you enjoyed the board games youll love the pc versionsi have windows xp on my laptop and ive never had any trouble with this game
i do have a refurbished ibm computer
this game allows you to play solo with human or computer opponents
the cg opponents come with various levels of scrabble experience
there are also quickie games that involve using letters in your rack to make the highest scoring word
this is one of the best scrabble games for your pc though updated versions have since been releaseddont be fooled by the design this is an excellent game
there are plenty of rides to build coasters merry go rounds observer towers d cinemas motion simulators etc
park managment is easy with graphs and plenty  statistics to manage your cash flow or park value
the only problem with  roller coaster tycoon is the time it takes to pass a year aroung   minutes
some of the scenarios require you to do it in  years so expect  to be playing for a long while
though i must say time seems to pass fast  because it is not boring
and they just released the expansion to this  giving you more rides and scenarios its really greatthis game is simple quick to install and not too advanced in graphics
it came out in  by micropose and has been the subject to a few addons such as loopy landscapes and corkscrew follies and now even a sequal roller coaster tycoon   this game is enomously popular and has been a favorite of manythe game has a simple concept build and mantain a theme park
to those that ever played any of the quotsimquot games such as sim city   or sim theme park this share the same basic concept
it is a typical simulation game
however i find it very addictive and love this gameyou start with different missions you are given a land and are required to obtain a certain goal mostly get a certain amount of people in your park mantain a  park rating by a certain time such as by  years
i find them all very easy done and it is not very challenging
however it is all still extremely fun
it is the satisfication of watching the roller coasters you built bloom and attract guests
it is the satisfication of watching a boring chunk of land be a hit amusement park
it is the satisfication of expanding your park to be bigger and have more rides and attract more and more people
this is one of the best games out there and i havent checked out roller coaster tycoon  yet but this is my favorite game for my pc and thats really good because i genrally pefer action gamesroller coaster tycoon lacks flashy graphics but the sounds are amazing
the scream of the people on the roller coaster the zoom of the gokarts the caching sound of making money the boom of the thunder when it rains in your park
the game has a simple yet specific money management though it is frustrating to wait to collect money to fund your next project a typical drawback of many simulations
another cool thing is the actually designing of a roller coaster which is like an art choosing the turns drops loops etc
the only drawback is that just the slightest drop and the ride gets a rating of quotultraextremequot and nobody will dare to ride it
each guest can be clicked on to examine what foodsdrinks hes bought or what rides how much money or even how happy he is
the game is very addictive and definetly deems a reccomendation from me
all simulation fans or sim city fans will definetly love this game and it is very easy to learn to play
i even think this video game has an educational value with the finance and money managing and construction skills
it is a game that will appeal to people ages   definetly get this gamethis is a great game
the custom coasters are the thing that really gives this game its value
there are so many different options you can add to your park
hours and hours of fun a must buyi love strategy games that really get you thinking
roller coaster tycoon garners many accolades in that it allows you to wear a variety of hats city planner as you lay out your park architect as you design your  rides landscape architect as you grade the terrain and select the  perfect varieties of trees and shrubs park manager as you raise and  lower the price of popcorn and so much more
in addition roller coaster  tycoon wraps all of this in a layer of campimagine finishing the design  of a new coaster opening it up children file in then turn green and  vomit on their way outoops
too intense
the sounds in the game are  hilarious
it even allows you to select individual children and assign them  names affording you the ability to track their moves
click on any child  and you can see what he or she is carrying how much money theyve spent  and what their needs are
do you have enough bathrooms
enough restaraunts
benches
this game is fun
well worth the low pricerct is a simulation theme park
build anywhere from landscapes to monster wooden roller coasters
choose from paths landscaping transport rides gentle rides thrill rides  water rides rollercoasters and shops
build  your own theme park while keeping it clean and safe but draining every  cent out of your guestsi used to play this game for hours at a time when i was younger
i had been looking for it in stores for a long time and i didnt even think about checking here so when i saw it i ordered it right away
it has challenges that you have to beat in order to get different levels
its a great game and i play it for hours at a timewow this game is amazing
a must buy for anyone who absolutely loves rollercoasters like me
i bought this game recieved from amazon who delivered in excellent condiion and played it the day i got it
at first i thought the game was mundane and boring but i hung in there and before i knew it i had a very successful amusement park and i met my goal in no time at all
my culinary arts teacher mrs vickie harrington known on here as msparrothead got me addicted to this game and i love it
please buy this game from amazon
amazon definitely delivers every timeroller coaster tycoon is increadable addicting
i would suggest having a friend hide the game on occation so you can get some sleep
you can do so much in this game is hard to grasp
some of the thing are build your own  rollercoaster or have a custom made on
keep your park popular and keep  building the new mega attration that will keep you topwhat a  gameanother addicting game
i have been trying to play this game and the sims at the same time and there just isnt enough time
i played this for  hours yesterday sunday and wondered where the time had gone
i had bought disneys coaster several years ago and thought this game would be just like it
wrong
this game is way better
you have several scenarios you play plus you can play and redo real amusement parks
they give you lots a money to start with to build up your park
you control the admission fees the price for all of the rides price on the food and you can even charge people for usin the restrooms
you hire mechanics people to mow and clean garbage security guards and entertainers
you can change the color of every ride and play your choice of music
there a banners that will display any message you type plus you can name any ride or food place
the best thing is you can design your own rollercoasters and water rides though they are expensive dont build your water ride too big as you typically only have  boats and the lines get long and customers get upset
you also do your own landscaping and you can see what every customer in your park is thinking and how each ride is liked
if you choose to you can watch them ride each of your rides
the only conflict with the game i have seen was what they call quotthrill ridesquot
when you go to build these the excitement level is typically low to moderate so i am not sure why they call those thrill ridesthis is a very addicting game and time will get away
i think if you get this game  you will also get addicted and then you will have to go buy the other  expansion packs just like i didi happened to play sim theme park stp first which i liked but in which the gameplay was constantly interrupted by a need to fix the rides
and while playing it i was thinking quotwell if that wasnt part of the game what would there be left to doquot now i get ityou can set up a park in roller coaster tycoon rct that basically runs itself
if you staff it well you wont even have to worry much about the usual things that turn guests off litter vandalism lack of facilities etc
and what are you doing during all this
planning expansions
landscaping
building rollercoasters
and its surprisingly entertaininga comparison with stp is useful here in stp i would repeatedly find some little detail and think quotwell that was coolquot the artistry of that game is elaboratebut inside of a week or two of fairly casual play i had seen all there was to see
in rct though the sensation one has is of actually making a park his own as opposed to just arranging elements that an artist has given him
youre still arranging someone elses artwork in rct but the pieces are small enough tht it doesnt feel that way
stp has the ultracool firstperson perspective option courtesy bullfrogs ultracool dungeon keeperpopuloustheme park engineand yet the graphics in that game are so gaudy as to be somewhat tiring
rcts decidedly more primitive graphics are actually easier to look at after a while and really encourage you to landscape your park
the two main drawbacks of the engine are that theres no first person view and that you can only rotate the isometric view by  degreesstps free rotation and zoom would be welcome here but rct provides myriad different views by allowing you to hide different features of the park and terrain
in fact the depth of various rct tools are amazing some of which i was surprised were left out of stp which was released after
in fact i find myself hesitant to state that there are tools missing from rct because ive found so many of them after thinking quoti wish the game gave me a way toquotthe game is not perfect of course
what is the deal with handymen
in stp you could drop your handyman on top of six piles of vomit and he might just walk away
in rct hell clean them up but youll wonder why he hadnt done it before
the manuals even admonish you that your handymen are sort of clueless
i think it must be some sort of ai problem
the routesetting mechanism in rct is more primitive than stps where you just have to drag your mouse around the area you want your worker to partol but surprisingly rcts works better in the sense that its much easier to add or remove a section of the park from someones route
neither game has a feature for you to say quotwhos patrolling this areaquot which results in some drudge work when your park gets big
you cant rename your workers in rct either which was a big help in stp for keeping track of themalso rct allows you to do some very cool stuff with tunnels and bridges but its hard to patrol those areas
in an early game i ended up putting a rollercoaster very very high up because of the way the terrain was and i could not get mechanics to inspect the ride resulting in the deaths of  poor little sims when the coaster suddenly flew off the track
so much for that quotsafest parkquot award
probably the most disturbing aspect of the ai in this game is how easily the guests get lost
one of the maps has a beautiful flower garden arranged in columns with one aisle going down the center and guests entering that will never find their way out
you can build a perfectly feasible realworld map and end up with an rctworld mess
often a creative solution is available thoughbut again most of these complaints feel like nitpicks
i can see why this game has persisted on the top ten charts for two years and im glad i got it as a sort of quotantidotequot to quotblack and whitequot
it doesnt ask you any deep philosophical questions and it doesnt really challenge ones ideas about what computer games can be or do its just funbefore i end this let me add that this game is somewhat tougher to learn than sim theme park
i could see  year olds playing stp whereas this game strikes me as having a year old lower levelthis game is wonderful
i couldnt believe the amount of physics in this game
you have a lot of rides to choose from and endless opportunities
one really good thing about this game is that theres a lot of levels which is really suprising for a sim
game
the game has a nice learning curve although its pretty difficult to make a good roller coaster when youre inexperienced
the graphics are really good considering it doesnt take much to run the game
its really fun watching roller coaster cars going fifty miles per hour through loops corkscrews helixes and many more special track designs
sound is great also
you hear people laughing screaming when you overlook your park masterpiece
the conversation sounds even get louder when you get to more crowded areas
this is a great game i suggest every sim
lover should buy itomg
i have never played a game like this in my intire life
i would highly recomend this for anyone who loves building games
i dont know if i got this same exact kind but love it anywaythis is the one
i have owned this game and continued to play it since it debuted over two years ago
i have watched it sit on the best seller charts for two yearsokay in the modern era of d the graphics are a little dated
sure its just sprite animation but the beauty is in the details chris sawyer and his team added
in a d game see the awful simthemepark and simcoaster for examples this level of minute detail cant be added there just arent polygon pushing graphics cards in existence to do it
so the reality is they are only dated because the game industry says d is the thing and not because they are less beautiful and detailedthe sound in this game is quite remarkable
as you scan your park youll intuitively now what parts are popular because youll just hear that familiar buzz of humanity when you pass over it
you know what i mean the soft buzz you hear at a baseball game in between innings or even at disneyland throughout your day
its just the sound of a ton of people all in one place
youll know youre passing over your most popular ride because you hear the screams of riders and giggles of people at the ride exit
oddly enough next time you go to a theme park youll swear you hear sounds right from this game on the thrill ridesthe brilliant idea of letting you create your own rides makes the game as limitless as your imagination
if youre a theme park nut how can you resist trying to build your own disneyland and watching small visitors enjoy your masterpiece
youll never create the same park twice because your imagination will send you in different directions each timeare there some problems with this game
absolutely but only after two years of playing
the fan community for this title has a long laundry list of things they would love to see in an rct  but this is just a testament to how detailed and fun the first game is
it simply is a reflection that the games fans cant wait for a sequelgo ahead and get this and pick up the loopy landscapes expansion
it is well worth it
if you have windows  then be sure to visit the official web site for a patch
i cant tell if you if xp is supported youll want to check their official sitethere is a massive fan community on the web that has devoted hours to writing special tools and quottrainersquot to let you unlock a few things this games designer didnt see fit to add
but dont let that scare you away
without any of those things you will find hours of enjoyment especially if you are a theme park nutif this game came out in  i think it would still be worthy on five stars
consider when it did come out and ask yourself how you missed out on this oneroller coaster tycoons verrry addictive whether it is played by a kid or by an adult
its fun it has cool graphics easy goals etc
i spent playing it once for  hours that i couldnt even hear my mother telling me to quit playing and eat my dinner
when i went to a friends house i brought this game and introduced it to my friends
they were all engrossed and couldnt concentrate on what we should have done and instead played this game for hours
my biggest mistake was lending the cd to one of my friends and returned it to me a couple of months laterhandling this game is pretty easy with all the building of roller coasters stalls etc
i have a lot of strategies in this game like prioritizing to build an information kiosk first so that if it rains you could raise money by increasing the prices of umbrellas
anyway parents should buy this game for their children coz it doesnt promote violence enhances strategies amp experience the fun of playing itroller coater tycoon is by far one of the best simulator pc game i have ever played
this game is what it sounds likeyou build a theme park
there are many different environments to choose fromyou get more environments as you beat more levels
the graphics in this game arent jaw dropping but they are okay
but this game isnt about graphics its about freedom
its very challenging to get your guests to actually like your parkthis is a great pc game and is highly reccomendeddanthis is a good game to get into if youve got some time on your hands
its definitely addicting but its not the type of addicting like where its boring as hell but you want to keep playing to unlock secrets and whatnot
it gets more challenging as you play and doesnt slow down
youre constantly moving and keeping the park clean as well as the rides moving smoothly
youre keeping your patrons from getting sick and keeping them from leaving the park and want them to spend as much money as they have in your parkyou can design your own rollercoasters water rides go kart rides etc
its a great game to get into but just be aware that youll want to keep playing once youve startedwhy not buy this version you ask
you may be saying to yourself ill buy this one and see if i like it then ill buy the expansions but i guarantee if you buy this game three months later want both expansion packs as well as rollercoaster ii
so spend the extra ten bucks now and get the two expansionsthis game is incredibly addictive just when you think youve got everything figured out youll find something new that you want to do
i have had this game for six months four months ago i had every land beat
but i kept playing even on parks that have been completed i still love just picking some angry guest and do everything i can to make him happy
i destroy old coasters and build my own design
this game has enough to do to keep even the most veteran gamers happy
the game earns five stars and higher if i could
but i only gave it one star because for ten bucks more you can almost quadruple your funbuy itthis is an extreamly addictive game
both  my son  and i want to play and we are constantly trying to get the mouse from the other during game play
we have various sim city and sim train games but none are as fun to play as this one
i think this is for two reasons
first the game is not one where you get frustrated because you go bankrupt every time you try to play
second ammusment parks are fun to go to and fun to build on a pc
you can build the park of your dreams
additionally the program is easy to learn seems to be absolutely bug free and the graphics are great
it lets you change the landscape and build various tunnels and other things that you wish they would have on real parks if they werent so darn cost concious
if you like sim games or just want to try one to see if you like them this is the one to get
happy buildingphew
meeting those scenareo goals were tough
but i did it
anyone who likes themeparks for real or on game will love this
dont be fooled by the title
it isnt just rollercoasters
in fact there is more of the other types of themepark attractions than there is coasters
lots moreyou get to manage everything from staff to construction
you can also theme them and name them
whatever type of themepark you want to do
do it
everything is to scale which is quite unusual for a strategy game
the only drawbacks are the very drawbacks that real park managers would have
once all of the goals are met an extra park appears
and then you can do what you wantits tough and time consuming but worth itthis game is lots of fun
i reccomend it to kids who love to figure out how to put something together
this game is loaded with education on how to spend your money wisely and how to construct things
it is a fun learning gamethis is such a great game
i love every minute of it
i just cant go on it for five minutes it turns into five hoursthe whole point of the  game is to create a cool theme park and have so many guests in the park and  a certain park rating by year   or  i love building roller coasters  on this game although it can be tough most coasters i build get an  intensity rating of ultraextreme and nobody rides it
but lets not forget  merry go rounds food stands bathroomsall the small thingshowever  this is not without its faults what game is
for instance the goal of  the scenario
if you surpass the amount of guests in your park and the park  rating is above the required usually around  and its only year   you gotta wait
and that can be aggravating
second why cant guests go on  the ultraextreme coasters
its not like theyll kill them or  somethingall in all this is a great game for your pc
its like a  drug how addictive it is
you might need a prescription to get off of itwithout a doubt this is the most popular game i have ever seen
it appeals to everyone from my friends who love rpgs to the ones who cant stop playing shooters
i honestly have not come across one person who doesnt like this game
you start the game with about  scenarios available in which you have to build up different theme parks to meet certain goals to unlocking new scenarios
you can control almost everything in this game and even more with the expansions from how much a slice of pizza costs to raising the price of an umbrella when its raining out
not only that but you can see what every single guest in the park is thinking carrying and doing as well as pick them up and move them around or name them
there are also tons of rides from merrygorounds to haunted houses and plenty of scenery options and themes but where the game really shines is on the construction of roller coasters
the game has prebuilt ones for you but you usually need and want to make your own
it takes practice to build ones people actually want to ride on but once you get it down its awesome
you can spend hours and hours playing this game it keeps you every bit as glued to the screen as civ ii did
although the game doesnt let you build a park from scratch the loopy landscapes expansion does so that problem is solved
the only detracting flaw of this game is that its sometimes hard to see what youre building if there are too many other rides around you but you can usually fix that by rotating the view and making things transparent
buy this game youll absolutely love itthis is one of my favorite computer games ever
you get to build all the rides you want and create your own amusement park
the one thing that i find really annoying is that you have to keep raising and lowering the ground but other than that this is a great gamei remember playing this game as a kid and when i came across it again years later i wanted to play it
im happy to say that its even better than i remember
create large parks entertain lots of guests basically create your own world
i love this game to bits and yes its a bit old and dated but for me its perfect
if you played this as a kid and loved it pick it up again
if you are new to it maybe look at a video of the game play and see if it is something you could enjoy
i love this game to death im keeping it foreverthis game is so much fun i play it too longi would give it ten stars if possiablei request anyone with a computer to buy this game and its addon packin this game you can build your own dream park with lots of rollar coaster shops merrygoround beautiful games etc
you can design your own rollar coaster with any colour and can design your own park
except this you can also kill people in your park
you can build a nonfinish rollar coaster and then start it when the rollarcoastercar reach there it will throw away and bomb all the people in the car will die immediately
but this is a healthy game for children and kill people will diminish your parks rating so i dont think you should do thatfirst of all this is not sim city nor was it even made by the company but that is a good thing in this case
the first difference is that rather than starting with some random piece of land to build your park you pick a scenario to beat
the controls are far easier than sim city and it flows more smoothly and there are far more details like walking people that get hungry angry thirsty sick and tired
you must make sure they have fun
by building steel standing corkscrew wooden and backward coasters yada yada ferris wheels motion simulators merrygorounds log rides and you get the picture
you can customize everything in the game the color of the ride the speed of the ride how many loops or laps everything has
however you need to be careful of three things when it comes to rides
the excitement to get the people on the ride the intensity to make sure they get a thrill and the nausea factor to make sure they dont throw up but when they throw up thats when you hire maintenance people who walk around cleaning stuffthis has to be the best game i have ever played and i have played a lot of games
this game is so addictive i think about it all the time
during school i think about some way i can build a better theme park
the graphics  are okay
frame rates are good at first but when you start building a lot  and more people come in they start to drop
it has pretty good sound
lots  of detail such as people screaming when they go down a hillive had  this game since christmas and i still devote all my free time to it i once  had a  hour sitting
you will play this game for ages and  agespleasebuy this game if you have a computerit is absolutly  necessary to have this work of art on you hard driveyou will never take it  offyou just wont want to stop playing this game
like certain books youre hooked from the very start of the game
the scenarios are actually  beatable after a few tries youre a third of the way through the game  but it actually advances in difficulty at the appropriate moments unlike  some other games i know of
now the most satisfying part of the game  itself custom building your own coasters
there are so many to chose from
inverted steel minecar single rail mini steel wooden stand up steel  bobsled etc
its so appeasing when you actually see people board your  coaster then disappointing to see the real life physics algorithim sling  them into oblivion killing x amount of people
of course there really  isnt any violence in the game besides freak accidents
also this game  helps develop and sharpen management skills you can do marketing  campaigns price setting goal setting etc
this game is the very best  top of the line
do yourself a favor its appropriate for any age and  rather addictive so go buy it nowwow
the game is very fun
you have many things to do in it
for explain you can bluid a roller coaster or checking to see if people like your park
the game is worth the money
big timei have never played such an addicting game
the scenarios are different and fun but the variety lacks
you get the same rides to choose from over and over again and when you create your own roller coaster your park guests become wimps and ignore it
the handymen are a pain to control since they never do their job and if you tell them to mow grass its all they do
excellent for a game that came out before the year roller coaster tycoon by chris sawyer is a theme park strategy game it is a game that makes you want to actually ride coasters even if you hate them it makes you belive you are creating a real theme park
the interface is almost the same as chris swayers earlier game transport tycoon and it is very easy to use
the gameplay was easy i was able to figure out the tool bar icons without much trouble
the gameplay is that you have to manage a theme park and complete the given objective within the time limit you could borrow money from the bank and there are limitations to how much you can borrow
there are almost every type of ride you see in real theme parks in this game kiddies train chartlift merry go round bumper cars go karts d cinemas boat rides obsevation tower force lift and ofcourse roller coasters there is every type of coaster in the world from
besides these there are many trees and when you build a pond ducks will come there
the hardest part of the game is building coasters that would work and the ones the guests would ride there are lots of already built coasters but desinging your own is a lot of fun
the bad thing about rct is that it comes without a screnario editor you can only play only the available screnarios most of the screnarios are very small in size you cannot build outside the park and not all parts of the land are available for sale and the park is are almost half built
the research tool is bad too it takes a lot of time and some times it comes up with rides useless for the current park
you can costumize them but they are in a mess too if you need just gentle rides it may research a chartlift in a very small park
still rct is the best strategy game i have ever played i loved it i played it for  hours and didnt know that i was on so long
rct is a must for people who love computer games and have the system requierments
it doesnt take a coaster nut to fall in love with this game get itits better than any other addictive substance or food well maybe not chocolate seriously this game is so fun
i do wish you could get money for the trees instead of paying to have them taken away
but thats a minor concessionzoo tycoon is a totally awesome game toowithout a doubtthis is the best computer game you will ever buydont hesitate to buy itand yes its worth way more than the simsnot in moneythe player runs his or her own theme parkchoose a location from the list at the beginning of the gamethere are also heaps more locations toas nintendo would put itunlockas you reach your objectivesbuild everything from icecream stores to merry go rounds to rollercoastersit is a really cute gamewatch your guests eatrace go carts and hit golf ballsyou may also hire entertianerslike giant pandas and decorate your rides with vibrant colourloopy landscape is a valuable extension to the gameadding more rideslocationsway more
coloirsentertainerswell more everything
whoever made this game is really clever and there is great attention to detailthis is a game addictive to people of all agesas the game host i was eager to get my hands on this gamewhen it game out
like pharoh and caesar iii this is a game ofdesigning buildings and walkways to keep your people happy
in this case the people are not residents although with some staying in your park for  days or more you have to wonder where they are sleeping
and like all games you start with rather easy missions and work your way forwardyou begin by planning walkways that make sense for your visitors and putting down inexpensive but entertaining rides
each visitor has his or her own sense of whats fun  something exciting something laid back something truly wild or something mild
you need to set up food drink and restrooms and put out benches and trashcans
you hire repairmen sweepers entertainers and security folk
vandalism can strike and rides can break downthe game once set up well can almost run itself
your various minions roam around your park cleaning and fixing items
you earn money based on quite a few variables  how much you charge at the gate how much you charge for food how much you charge for each ride
rain comes and visitors are now buying umbrellas and avoiding the open rides
marketing campaigns can help your draw although coupons might affect profits shorttermthere are great graphs to help you manage the economics of your strategy and the graphics themselves are quite fun
the merrygoround spins the rollercoaster cars fill with little people and go around the tracks
you can customize colors add statuary research new theme decorations like egyptian and roman buildings
you can raise and lower terrain building raised walkways and underground roller coaster tunnelsthe game will run quite well on a lowend system which cant be said for its rival simthemepark
its easy to use and quite satisfying to play
you can name the park name each ride and even name each individual visitor
its easy to get attached to your creation and sit for hours tweaking itthe game was entertaining both for me and for my  year old son
we both found the options varied and fun
my son especially enjoyed when you accidentially cranked a rollercoasters speed up too high  the practice run would set the cars careening off the track warning you to decrease the speed a bitour only complaint has to do with item placement  if you raise and then lower a piece of land it doublecharges you for each phase of the change
there isnt really an undo feature so if you make a mistake which can be easy sometimes there is no simple way to just go back to your previous state
with blocks of land easily hid behind other blocks despite their many view options you often have to lower whole regions of land simply to quotget toquot the blocked one wasting hundreds of dollarsalso with no fast forward you often have to go eat dinner or watch a movie before your park which has met the winning criteria finally gets through the years required for the trophy
itll run itself all the while but it can get quite tediouswith that small amount of inconvenience however this is a great game for computer users of all ages and with the varied terrains available one able to always offer a new challengeyou may not even need my review i mean just look at the average costumer rating
out of  reviews it still hase  starsso basicly you build your own theme park by managing it feeding guests entertaining them and not getting them sick
it is quite a challenge
im not gonna go on and on about this game because it is only  bucks and has a great overall ratingso here is a little advise buy iti bought this game because my sister and i wore out the first roller coaster tycoon disc we had
arrived promptly and works greati guess thats a good thing when you are up all night playing a game some might consider it less than ideal when you have to go to work the next dayi did run into a couple problems with it not reacting well to some other windows programs i was running but it never crashed just reversed colors or other weird things until i shut the other programs off
no big dealthe game itself is very well done tons of fun
i dont know what i enjoy more building the park ago but have found most sims since then rather boring
this one is not
definitely a winnerroller coster tycoon blows the sim city series out of the water
in this game you try to complete objectives by building an amusements park that will keep your guests happy
you will get a limited amount of money to start than once your park becomes popular you can raise prices to earn more money
your park will only do good if you have crazy rides and food drink and bathrooms
you can put out add campaigns and hire and fire workers
every kind of stand and ride you can think of will be in this game
if you dont want to use the standard designs for the rides you can come up with your own crazy concaktion and by the way the guests will like that a lot better
you will wish you can go to these parks ride these rides and eat these foods
i strongly suggest that you get this game whatever age you arethis game is incredible
the graphics are great and the game play is awesome
you can build several differentstyle rides including water slides go carts bumper cars and classic rides such as the ferris wheel scrambler and merrygoround
and who could forget the roller coasters
pick your design and place a preconstructed layout or build your own for unlimited designs
this is one of the best games i have and i would recommend you go get it right nowthis game takes sim games to another level
it eats on theme park and them park world
you have total control of your environment and you can build big and i mean big rollacostersthe levels are well laid out with  different scenarios
you dont build every park from scratch
to win a level  you have to use a combination of park value number of customers money in  and happiness of customersthe rides are great and there are no bugs  that i have seen
the add on pack is great and there are hundreds of extra  rides etc at the web site
the best is an alton towers scenario which is so  similar to the real thing
this is a hughely addictive game
i bet if you  start playing it you wont stop til you finish
if you like any sim  management game then buy this onei thought that theme park was a good game to do with theme parks but when i saw this i just had to have it
i was in the usa and thought that this is what i want to do to be able to design my own park and to be able to run it all
but there are always problem when running a theme park
you get put as the designer maker and manager of your own coorporation however big it is
the missions that you have to try and achieve are really great and life like
you can actually see theme park around the world having to cope with all of the aspects that you have to cope with when playing this gamethe areas that you are put are also very real in a way as you are limited to space and have to try to get round this in a variety of different ways
you can even buy or rent extra land if oyu are in need of some but not all of it is for sale which brings you to think like what a proper company has to cope withthis is all just about the amount the space and are to build in but all the other aspects are just as great
you can create the wackiest and fastest roller coaster of your choice there are no limits but i do advise you to test it before you open it to the public as you may well have a few accidentsthere is such a wide variety of ride and attractions that you can choose from and get throughout the duration of the game
just put a bit of money aside to the development of new rides and it comes up with the best ride that you can think ofeven down to the colour or the make of the path shows you how detailed that this is
there is a very wide range of paths colours and even fences to stop people going where they shouldntwhen choosing to build a roller coaster there are so many things that you can do with a piece of track
you can make it speed upslow down cork screm loop the loop or even have a photo shoot plus much much more realistic ideas to choose fromthere are even more great things to choose from i nthe addon pack that you can also buy
there are some great things to choose from on theseyou really get the feeling like you are actually there managing the whole park and how it runs
it is a great feeling when you start to make a profit and can build the best park with all the best rides that you can think ofwell if you like theme parks then this is for youjust when i thought there wasnt a better game out there than the sims roller coaster tycoon gives that game a run for its money
this game is so fun
you dont just get to build roller coasters you can build log rides water slides and a variety of other premade carnival rides carousels ferris wheels etc
add paths scenery and shops and you have the park of your dreams
its so rewarding to watch the little people clamor to get in line for your rides and to see them jump up and down with glee if they enjoyed the ride
if theyre hungry build them a popcorn stand
if theyre tired build them some benches
though the game looks a little complicated and overwhelming at first once you get the hang of it youll be fine
the manual is pretty good and should help you along
my only complaints are the sound effects  hearing the people squeal with glee is great but hearing the toilets in the little bathrooms flush is not
whether youre a kid at heart who has always loved amusement parks or a tycoonintraining youre bound to like this gamein what other game can you build a  mile go kart track hire security guards and clean up pukeroller coaster tycoon an extremely fun amusement park simulator
you can design your own parks and rides set your prices and attend to your guests needsthis game is appealing to children and to adults particularly because things can get pretty complicated
this game will teach you manage many things at once quicklythe disasters that strike are awesome and the graphics are good d or not
i recommend this game to anyone
it may get a little tedious in expert levels but its a blast to playanyone who has an old computer like mine  years old knows it is getting harder and harder to find quality games that will fit your system
roller coaster tycoons minimum requirements are only  mb ram a cd rom drive speed of x and  mb of free hard drive space so it works great even on my obsolete system
what is more it is a fun game
the first simulation game i became familiar with was theme hospital and since i enjoyed that game so much i decided to switch from the hospital beds and psychiatry couches to the roller coasters and concession stands
theme hospital was a little easier to learn
at first i could not figure out how to get the rides up and running but the tutorial soon set me straight
now i am having hours of fun with this gamethis game allows you to do all kinds of things
you can build a variety of rides from the kiddie ones haunted house curly slide carousel ferris wheel to scary complex roller coasters
you can even name the rides
the roller coasters can come premade or when you get more advanced you can design your own
there are also a variety of concession stands to build including a burger place soft drink stand balloon stand popcorn pizza french fries you name it
different scenery can be chosen too including those with a greek roman or egyptian theme to really give your park character
as you play the game new rides scenery and concession stands will be introduced
each time i play i discover something new
you also get to hire maintenance men handymen security guards and entertainers guys dressed up like pandas elephants or tigers
you do not have to babysit the game as much as theme hospital as your workers always go where theyre needed
sometimes you need to move handymen to different spots to clean up vomit and litter faster
remember to hire enough maintenance men to inspect the rides otherwise crash
patrons can die in this game so watch out
you can also check what the customers are thinking about your park and the different rides
the only annoying part of the game is when customer after customer gets lost and the game keeps beeping at you
you have to adjust the walk ways to prevent this
otherwise this game is loads of fun easy to learn and very rewarding when you begin to see the amusement park of your dreams taking shapethe only complaint that i have about this game is that its too addicting
i couldnt stop until i had completed all of the scenarios and beaten the whole game but then the expansion pak loopy landscapes came along ill guarantee that if you like other sim games that youll like this one
its very hard to get tired of you can make your own roller coasters with as man loopdeeloops as you want add cotton candy stalls merrygorounds water slides hire staff and do virtually anything you want
its fun to watch the sim people come into your park and go from ride to ride spending all their money along the way
if you end up liking this game as much as i do youll probably want to get the loopy landscapes expansion pack as well
this game is almost flawless two thumbs updesigning the next alton towers would be most peoples dream and now you can
this game is easy to pick up and it is perfectyou can design your own roller coaster way more sophistacatedly than on any other theme park games
 you can higher or lower land
 add all sorts of scenery the people actually say a variety of different things and do a variety of different things
it tells you how much money each person has and what they are carrying as well as their favourite ride and lots of other stats
 litter and vandalism must be kept away by hiring staff and building litter bins
 there are around twenty different landscapes each with their own objectives
 you can buy add on packs to add loads more it is possible to actually play a perfect replica of alton towers and blackpool pleasure beach if you get the loopy landscapes add on pack
 your park can win all sorts of awards including safest tidiest best value most beautiful cleanest toilets and more
 when you design a roller coaster you can then test it and you can find out its averagemax speed and its excitement intensity and nausea ratings
 i accidently killed  people because the brakes failed on my roller coaster
 your park is rated so you need this to be high to pass most objectives plus the guest toll or the park value
there are usually time limitsoverall i would rate this in the top ten most fun games on any consolecomputer
if you own theme park world like me you will be amazed on the huge gap between them
get itto turn  words of praise for this magnificent game into three buy it nowthe fact looks much smoother and crisp then sim theme park many more shops and rides tons more themes to decorate your park more detail much nicer to look at etc
etc
etc
if this game is not in your game library you are missing the fun
be sure to buy rollercoaster tycoon loopy landscapes expansion pack for many more rides shops scenery and so onif laughter is the best medicine then cure your blues with this game
lose yourself in the fun of being the top dog at your own amusement park
with a little logic and creativity you will be successful but dont  think the game is silly or too easy this one can be a challenge and  dont forget the expansion packsome games such as the sims are addictive at first but quickly lose their appeal
rollercoaster tycoon is a game that keeps you interested because you continually discover new strategies
furthermore if you enjoy roleplaying a computer game rollercoaster tycoon allows you to quotthemequot your parks by changing the colors names scenery etcif you enjoyed games such as simcity age of empires and civilization i would recommend this game because it follows a similiar strategy and planning mechanism
the addon packs corkscrew follies and loopy landscapes add some interesting components but are not recommended unless you enjoyed this game immensely
for your best bet since the game has been out for awhile i would wait a few months when the game will be sold with the expansion packs added on to itthe internet site allows you to download various rollercoaster designs and there are fan websites set up that also allow you to download their designs
so far with the patches i have not encountered any game crashesa game that remains entertaining longer than most and powerfully addictive the first month you purchase iti will try to make this short and sweet
roller coaster tycoon is one of the funnest sim build em up games out there
in the tradition of sim city rtc follows the same concept except to build your very own theme park with everyones favorite ridethe rollercoaster
along with other types of carnival rides and many different scenarios to play rtc is guaranteed to offer many hours of strong entertainment as well as a ton of fun
if you do decide to purchase rtc i strongly recommend to pick up the loopy landscapescorkscrew follies combo expansion pack
this expansion adds about  new scenarios and many new exciting coasters which really do make an excellent and exciting theme park
i highly recommend that anyone in which this concept of building a theme park intrigues to at least pick up the original game
i guarantee that it wont take long before you decide to get the expansion packsyoure probably thinking another simulation game on the market i wont even bother
however you are wrong if that is your opinion
this is a great game and you will play it so much you probably will lose sleep
the basic gist of rct is building an amusement park
however it isnt quite as simple as it sounds
there are special objectives for each course and to get new scenarios you need to meet these goalsyou can build your dream amusement park
it must include refreshment stands rides of all sorts bathrooms and many other things that you can choose fromthere are many different types of rides and you should build each type because everyone in the park likes different types of ridesalso as you are in the game you obtain new objects and rides as you go along
there arent too many choices at first but as the game progresses you get more and more typesyou build rides from scratch but if you are a daredevil like me dont build your dream coaster unless you want it to just sit there
that is the disadvantage of the gamemy intensity and nausea ratings are always too high for the gueststhey are gutless
so make sure that you build rides and coasters that arent quottoo intensequot for the little wimpsthis is a great game overall and if you like theme parks and amusement parks you really should get this gamei never thought this game looked very good until i played it at a friends house
i went out and bought it for the very low price of under ten bucks at walmart the next dayit is so much fun
you can build and design your own rides or buy ones that have already been built
food stands bathrooms and souvenier stands can also be purchased as well as scenery items
detailed information is available about all of your customers from their feelings to how much money theyre willing to spend at your park
you have a certain goal to reach when you create a theme park and when you reach it your name will be posted under the location name
and there are many new locations to unlock as well
you can hire handymen to clean up trash and puke mechanics to fix and check rides security guards to make sure no one breaks anything and entertainers that can be dressed in a panda tiger or elephant suit
also some advice dont let your park entrance fee be free if you start at  people will keep saying that your entrance fee is cheap and you get to raise it
i got as high as  once
overall if you like the sims or zoo tycoon you will enjoy this game
it is addicting and is now a favorite of mine
im so happy i gave it a chancei just want to say this is a really great addicting game
you build your own theme park and in the process have to meet certain goals
there are plenty good rides and stalls you can purchase for your park and you can set advertising and research funds
overall through this short review i am truly pleased with the quality of this game and would suggest it for anyonealthough this may not be the best game ever it is a fun experience that has endless hours of gameplay
its a unique fun and unpredictable game that many people have played
the graphics might not be the best they seriously dont have to be and the sound may be odd sometimes this makes a solid game that is funbasically in this game you build your own theme park
theres tons of scenerios especially if you buy the expansion pack in which you make a part with different rides and things at your disposal on a different landscape
there are a lot of levels that are all different and all have their own themeat the beginning of a level you get a goal that you have to meet to beet the scenario
from there you go building and creating rides shops eating stalls and more
you can build all sorts of things  from water slides to roller coasters from haunted houses to swinging ships
you can even build food places drink stalls a balloon shop and information booth and more
you can even build you own unique roller coaster or download one off the internet if youre not happy with the prebuilt ones in the game
this game is challenging since you have to manage your park while keeping a large amount of moneyright now you can get this game for about  so id buy this cheap fun gamewell this is one of the few games where its hard to find any problems
i loved rollercoaster tycoon and would recommend it to anybody from a hardcore gamer to someone just starting to play games this game is that  much funthe major strong point in this game is the gameplay
it is  very addictive and very fun
the graphics arent exactly what id call  industry leading but hey they arent supposed to bepeople will  undoubtably compare rollercoaster tycoon to sim theme park
i my opinion  there is no comparison rt wins all the way even though stp has more  features d view first person view etc
stp just cant capture the  fun the way rt doesso rollercoaster tycoon gets my recomendation  for any age or skill level
have funoh yeah and for a little  twisted fun try removing a piece of rollercoaster track in the middle of  the ride
hehethis is a really fun game to play you can make money and loose money
there are certain objectives that you have to do like earn a certain amount of money and have a certain amount of people and a certain amount of the park value
this is a really good simulation type game
plus you can control where the people go and you can kill some people in the water and sometimes the rollercoaster will chrash and kill people
that is really fun when you get boardmany of you are probably curious like i was is this game really that good
 will i like the simulation gameplay since i am used to actionadventure games
 i heard its like bullfrogs theme park and i hated that game
etc etc etcwell let this make it clear to you
even  years after it came out its still the most addictive game ever made
and its worth the dollarsdont forget the loopy landscapes pack an extra  dollars
sure its not d but the reason its not d is cause everybody would need a pentium  processorwhich should be out by to look at all the gorgeous colors and amazing details in dmany are saying i dont like these slow simulation games
well neither did i but i am sure everyone of you want to own and design your own park when you go to a real theme park like disneyland
and you say to yourself just imagine how nice this place would be if i owned it and designed all the thrilling rides
well this game gives everybody the chance
it takes simulation games and makes them fun
infact it adds action
for example dont expect to just sit there after you make a  coaster and are waiting for the money to become available
you have to drag the handymen to clean the vomit
you have to create benches
you have to advance the themes by adding mere  dollar statues
you have to make sure that the guests dont leavenow many say making the rollercoaster is hard
well it wont be hard if people used common sense
and after a while it wont be that challenging as youll be making coasters underground going through one another into the water and etcetcyou can personalize your park to whatever you like but to get the ultimate personalization equipment please get the expansion pack loopy landscapes
it also includes the first expansion pack corkscrew follies
so its a good deal
so please head over to the review for loopy landscapes and find out what kind of cool addons you get
if your in a budget limit and cant afford the expansion pack right nowlemme just tell you that the personalization tools in rct are pretty good
the expansion packs just add to it
you can paint the rides to what you want rename guests rename the rides the name of the park etc etcfor the people who can afford the expansion packs go to loopy landscapes review right nowi am not given to strong statements but in this case i will make an exceptionthe best game ever
its very easy to get started will run on quotslowerquot computers and once you get into it you cant get out
you get totally lost in the world you createits so much fun making  rides and then watching people enjoy them
i love the way you can pick a  certain person to watch and see what rides they pick the way you have so  much control over designing rides the ease of making coasters although  they can be quite fancy basically i love everything about this game
i am  not a quotgamerquot but i got so hooked on this it was almost scaryi got this little guy the day it came out in the summer
i dont know if its been laziness that kept me from writing a review or just the fact  that everybody already knows this game rules
first the bad stuff the  graphics kinda well they arent on par with current games but its not  like its gonna turn you off from this game if it does than youve got some  problems
this game is also extremely addictive
youll play it everyday  for hours on end but once you beat it or run low of energy youll want to  burn it at the stake
yes after you log in about  hours you will start  to hate the game and never want to see it again but after a few months  you will return to the wimsicle world that is rct
the game is like every  other sim game build the rides advertise get the cash get bigger rides
your laid out with missions to accomplish in the alloted time limit so no  sluffin off here
you soon get bigger rides and better addons to your  rides
you need to hire people to research rides watch the park and yes  scoop up the throwup of your more queasy guests
sure sim theme park may  look a little nicer but rts has the man meat were it counts and thats in  pure funthe product was exactly as shown and described good price and timely delivery
the whole purchase went smoothly and i enjoyed playing it and remembering the good old days with pc gamingafter the original simcity came out i had thought it would be cool to have sims based on other industries
when i first heard of rct i ran out and bought it
two years later i still am not bored with itthe flexibility the game gives you in designing your own rollercoasters and theme parks is remarkable
this is one game that lets the players creativity shineif you like any of the simgames you will love rct
if you are trying to decide between this and themepark choose rct
rct has a more realistic feel and better coaster design capabilitiesthe game never gets old with its many rides and many levels atari did a great job putting this game together
creating a prk is a blast
i love it
there is unlimited rides rollercoasters and food accommodations
it teaches you the value of a dollar
very good teaching skills
once you start it you wont stop with its wonderful game play
wonderful graphics
wonderful story line this game is the best of the best
awesome wonderful fantastic
brovoafter i started playing this game i realized that i had a history of  simulation addiction  having played five or more simulations including  the recent hit quotthe simsquot  roller coaster tycoon is definitely  one of the best sims out there and there are many other theme park sims to  choose fromthe interface takes a short time to get familiar with but  is very simple and easy to operate
the graphics are great could you use  this program to design a real rollercoaster
looks like it to me
 the  levels each have different goals and features
i especially appreciated  all the different theme landscaping available including greek and roman  architecture wonderland theming giant chess pieces candy mushrooms  etc and wild west props
the rollercoasters are a blast to build but  not simple to master
after  rollercoasters i have yet to build the  perfect ridemy only problem was with the  view  at some points  its hard to see whats going on with your rollercoaster as it interacts  with other rides and the landscaping
this problem was easy to solve as  the view options allow you to quotturn offquot the rollercoaster  supports landscaping paths or anything else that gets in your line of  sighti heartily recommend this to any fan of simulation games in the  vein of sim city theme hospital or the sims
this is a great game with a  high addiction factorbefore i commend gravis i must thank sony for making such a great playstation controller
and thank you gravis for making the same controller for the pc
although the controller is small it fits perfectly in my hand
the is an  axis control pad on the left select and start buttons in the  middle and  buttons on the right
at the top there are  more button
another great thing about the controller is that the buttons are not mushy
you can press the easily not like the real playstation controller
the  manual has instructions and troubleshooting techniques for installing in  different languages
the keyset program xperience is bundled on the cd  with documentation for that software on the cd
although a little tricky to  program the keyset software works great
so if you have a playstation or  you play alot of playstation games and you need a pad for the pc this is  definitaly for you
for everyone else its a great cost effective pad
also some games like fifa  would us the same button setup like on the  playstation if you use this padif you play consolelike games on your pc this is a must have
there may be more expensive and perhaps even better gamepads out there but this has done the job for me for almost three years and ive never had a problem with it
there arent very many products at such a low cost one can say that about these daysthis is very much like the playstationps controller
there are no analog sticks but i hate those things anyway so perhaps if youre still a digital thumbpad kinda person like me this may be all you really need to play most pc games while hardly touching the keyboard
its a bit small and basic but it does the job and is obviously very well made
though i dont usually throw game controllers around in the heat and fun of playing video games i have dropped this many times and havent really been easy on it and its still working as perfectly as the day i bought and installed itinstallation is easypeasy and this works not only on most pc games flight simulator  xwing rogue squadron need for speed series midtown madness nfl fever  nhl and probably  more i dont own but it works great with nes and snes emulators and games and psone emulated games as well
if you really need analog sticks there are other gamepads you should look into but if not this is the pc equivalent of what most people are using to play ps gamesthis is a great gamepad
sooner or later in any pc gamers life if theyve been trying to play with the mouse and keyboard alone they will think of buying a joystick or gamepad
this is the one i bought long ago and id pay double what theyre asking now if mine ever broke
a basic but very rugged and functional gamepad
a bargain at twice its price
get onejedi knight is a first person shooter game like doom or quake but with a star wars twist
to me the familiar star wars aliens and even the new ones make this game a true joy to play
jedi knight easily has one of the  best game soundtracks ever with the booming symphony sounds in the  backgroud
the graphics and gameplay are also a sight to be seen
a  truely fantastic game anyone who enjoys first person shooters should try  this one outthe thing thats realy great about this set is that you get three cds worth of games
you get the original dark forces ii game that has quite a  bit of gameplay plus the mysteries of the sith game that is almost as long  as jedi knight
for the price you get a lot of playing timejedi knight  follows the path of kyle katarn an eximperial soldier turned rebel
his  father was murdered and as the game progresses you learn the truth about  your family and learn the ways of the forceone of the interesting  twists of jedi knight is that your alignment towards the dark side or the  light side is determined by how many innocent people you kill or by certain  moral decisions you make as the game progresses
you shape your own  destiny and at the end of it all your decisions determine how the story  turns outon the second game mysteries of the sith you primarialy play  mara jade although you also spend time in kyle katarns shoes once  again
much likes its predecessor you find yourself once again going  against the empire before they destroy a rebel base and ruin all hope the  rebellion has against defeating the imperial forces
from there you embark  on a search to find the lost kyle katarn and find your way through an  amazingly twisted and trap ridden sith templethe thing that sets these  games apart from most first person shooters is that you do more than run  around and kill things
you have to make moral decisions solve puzzles  and use tactics to your advantage
by the first hour or so of gameplay  youll easily lose yourselfand finally as an extra special bonus there  is a hidden level on the mysteries of the sith cd of cloud city that allows  you to follow in lukes footsteps from empire strikes backthere are few games inspired by movies that capture the feel of those movies as well as dark forces ii jedi knight has
it isnt any one thing that does it be it the music the graphics the characters or the sound  effects that draw the player so completely into the game until all senses  are immersed in the environment but rather they all combine so perfectly  that jedi knight accomplishes just that
if i had anything approaching a  complaint it might be that those  levels go by awfully fastthe  player assumes the role of and control of kyle katarn a former imperial  agent who turned against the empire to help the rebellion against the  fearsome new dark trooper project
now its five years later and the  empire has been defeated but katarn hasnt been sitting on his laurels  this time its personal
kyles father morgan has been murdered and a  disk he had made for kyle has been stolen by jerrik the sinister leader of  cabal of dark jedi whom he is leading with the aid of a faction of imperial  soldiers to find a world upon which thousands of jedi fought a battle  centuries earlier and their souls are now trapped there
it is jerrks plan  to tap that power for himself a transformation that may spell doom for the  fledgling new republicthe game starts with kyle escaping from a  death trap on the moon of nar shadda laid by the mercenary droid t  whom he must find in order to retrieve the lost disk
as kyle you must  fight your way trough legions of blastertoting and thermal detonator  throwing grans and quick trigger happy rodians in order to achieve your  objectives
running ducking and a fine sense of balance are needed to make  your way through the first three nar shadda levels and once the disk has  been found kyle must escape imperial reenforcements with the help of his  best friend jan ors played by the stunning angela harrie
it is after  the escape that kyle has his first vision a visitation by the jedi knight  qu rahn benoit gregory who tells him of jerriks evil plan and  encourages kyle to become a jedifrom nara shadda its off to kyles  home planet of sulon an agroworld where he must find the old family robot  weegee who can play the encrypted disk
kyle also receives rahns  lightsaber and before long his destiny is set
the way lucasarts handled  the application of jedi powers is brilliant as is their ease of use
players gain stars by finding secret areas these stars are then applied  to an ever increasing selection of neutral jedi abilities super speed  force jump force seeing and force pull
after these are mastered the  player has the option to become either a light or dark jedi with  corresponding powers
while the dark side powers are nice and flashy they  are not nearly as useful as the light side abiltieslight side  powers include force blinding that you can use to dazzle opponents so they  miss you with their shots force protection a literal force field that  resists all damage force persuasion that allows you sneak in unnoticed  and force absorption which allows the player to absorb the dark side  energies wielded against you and finally force heal which heals damage
dark side powers include the grip which lets you crush people force throw  that allows you to hurl large objects at your foes deadly sight which  immolates your enemies and force destruction which hurls a bolt of  powerful energy at your opponentsfrom kyles home on sulon its  off to the city of barons hed where kyle must now go in order to learn the  location of the lost valley of the jedi
it is also here that he must  battle the first of the dark jedi a young man named yun who is all to  eager to please his dark master
from there kyle makes his way onboard a  freighter bound for the planet with the valley and where he must also  battle gorc and picdark twins of the force
and again lucasarts must be  praised for sheer perfection with which the excuted lightsaber dueling in a  first person view game
players can parry attacks while performing slick  and flashy maneuvers on their owni wont reveal any more of what  happens through out the game to those people who may have not yet had a  chance to play this classic
i think one of the several reasons why this  game is so memorable are the live action cut scenes which were the first  star wars footage shot in almost fifteen years
kyle is handsome and  dashing jan ors is beautiful and witty and the other characters like  rahn jerrik and his henchmen maw boc the beautiful and deadly sariss all  go a long way to immerse the player in the finest first person shooter i  have ever played
i still find enjoyment in this title even though it is  four years old and starting to look dated the game still holds my  attention
of the star wars games released to date this is by far the most  superior engrossing and ultimately rewarding of the lotanyone who has ever seen star wars has always had  reaction i wonder what it would be like to be a jedisith
well now they have the chance to answer that question
plus you get  games for the price of one
who wouldnt like that deal
jedi knight takes you into the eyes of kyle katarn a jedi knight
as you play through levels the challenges get harder and harder
you will need to hone your lightsaber practice in order to beat the game
mysteries of the sith picks up where jedi knight leaves off
this time the game takes you into the eyes of mara jade a former imperial turned jedi
once again you will want to hone your lightsaber practice because this time the challenges are harderfighting a rancor for example
these games are worth the moneyi forgot how fun this game isi havent played this since  since im usually a console gamerthe other day i was bored and deceided to install this again in my new  pc and give it a whirlsince back in the day i  gave up on this onei have to say this game is still awesome it plays smoothly and the graphics still hold up pretty well to this daysure its not as graphically beautiful as a game on the xbox or playstation   butdark forces jedi knight is well worth your time checking out or revisiting it  as in my case youll be glad you didthe missions are long and intensetheres a lot of actionyoull run into some old friends such as bossk and  lots of  stormtroopers among other enemies theres nothing like blasting imperial troopsits a great stress reliever thats for sure
theres also some great live action video  thats well acted and moves the storyline at a cinematic pace  plus  you get force powers  depending on if you choose the light or dark side of the force your actions during gameplay deceide that and the use of a lightsaberbut for me  i personally prefer using a blaster as an added bonus this edition contains  a companion mission pack called mysteries of the sithwhere you mostly play as mara jadefighting  various scum and villanywhile learning more about the ancient secrets of the dark jedi ordersure the graphics on this bonus  arnt up to par  as dark forces its still fun to playand it enhances the whole dark foeces  experience i say if your looking for a great star wars gametrack this one down  youll be glad you didthis is one of the best games ive ever played its the only pc game i have that is onlinethis is the second best computer game of all time as far as i am concerned only supassed by halflife
the graphics are kind of dated now but the gameplay is still soild and loads of funthe game contains all of the  best gameplay while being intermixed with a good story
the levels are  designed very well and never seem to quotfeelquot the same way  twiceof course one of the best parts of this game is using the  lightsaber in regular gameplay or against six dark jedi
no other star wars  game has been able to capture the feel of the lightsaber like this  onethe sound effects are very good and the soundtrack is classic star  wars with perfect timings to get the right music for what you are  doingi cant think of anything more to say than if you havent already  played this game you are missing out on one of the greatest games of all  timethis was the first computer game i ever bought
id been hearing about it since  when pc gamer did a feature on it and after reading that article i knew id be buying this game
in fact i went and bought it before i even had a computer of my own to play it on
when it came out in the fall of  it blew the doors off every magazine that reviewed it
until halflife came out a year later this game was the one to beat
and granted the graphics are pretty seriously dated now in  its still a great game a true classicnow let me tell you whythis was the first game that brought a true melee weapon  a lightsaber  and force powers into an fps and made them work flawlessly something no one thought was possible until then
it was also the last game until enter the matrix that used fmv sequences between missions that actually helped flesh out the story taking placekyle katarn is the name of the man you play as
hes a former imperial officer who resigned out of rage when he learned his father had been killed by imperial operatives
he joined up with the rebel alliance and you played as him in the game dark forces which was sort of a prequel to this gamenow its a year after return of the jedi
the empire is reeling fractured disorganized and the alliances star is rising
but the game doesnt begin with that instead it starts with the execution of a jedi knight whos been in hiding all this time
this jedi qu rahn has been living on the run because he has a secret that wouldve meant absolute power in the hands of anyone who gets it
who kills him
jerec a dark jedi aided by six others like him who will do anything to get that secretthat secret is the valley of the jedi an ancient jedi burial ground where the force is extremely concentrated
anyone who taps into that massive stockpile of power would gain literal godlike abilities in the forceso what does all this have to do with kyle katarn
simple his father morgan knew the hidden location of the valley
morgan was good friends with rahn
and morgan was murdered by jerec who didnt know what secrets morgan had
it quickly becomes a journey of selfdiscovery for kyle who takes up rahns lost lightsaber and races to beat jerec and his allies from finding the valley and stop them from exploiting its poweror taking that power for himselfthis game had two different endings depending on which path you choose
if you choose dark force abilities and you callously slaughter civilians you become a dark jedi yourself competing with jerec over the valleys fate
but if you choose light force abilities and you go out of your way to defend civilians youll become a jedi knight and work to protect the valley from jerec and his dark jedijedi knight blew me away when i played it
i loved every aspect of it all of which was thanks to justin chin who was the project leader and who wrote the story
he did an incredible job make no mistake
kyle and his allies  jan ors an alliance soldier qu rahn assisting you from beyond the grave and wee gee the family droid  are all archetypes cut from the star wars cloth which is nothing but a good thing in my mind
the dark jedi on the other hand  jerec a twisted and evil former jedi from the old republic sariss a cold calculating perfectionist maw a hateful being whose rage fuels his power boc a warped and clearly insane twilek pic and gorc a bizarre set of twins like youve never seen and yun the youngest and best of the bunch  are almost all inspired by the title characters from akira kurosawas classic film the seven samuraithe settings are just what youd expect full of atmosphere that couldve been lifted directly from the movies
nar shaddaa is like hong kong in space with buildings crammed together without planning
sulon is a pastoral agrarian world at least where it isnt under the empires heel
and the valley of the jedi and its tombs evoke are so rich with history you can almost hear the spirits of the jedi speaking to you in the hallways of the burial groundsalso packaged in this bundle is the one and only expansion pack for it mysteries of the sith
its set five years after the events of jedi knight which naturally assumes you chose the light side
you play as kyle again in the first few missions whos taken on an apprentice  mara jade a character introduced in timothy zahns star wars books from  heir to the empire dark force rising and the last command
after that first batch of missions kyle goes off to chase down a lead leaving you controlling mara for the remainder of the game
you take missions aiding both the fledgling new republic and the newlyrebuilt jedi order until you travel to a forgotten sith temple to rescue kyle from the dark sideand from himselfwhile sith had a few flaws  why would kyle have to relearn force abilities he already had
why not say who the sith were instead of just dangling the name around
 i did like the setting of the sith temple
this place is genuinely creepy where the spirits of the dead know no rest and never will
i also liked how they handled the ending duel
its audacious and it fits in perfectly with the jedi precepts
its also so simple that youd never think of iti recommend this game as heartily now as i wouldve eight years ago
its a lowtech game so its practically guaranteed to run on whatever rig you have
and because its been out for so long you can pick it up for a fraction of the price of the current gamesbuy this game
its worth a lot more than youll pay for itthis game is the best game absolute best game ever released on computer
it revolves around the original sw movies set just after the destruction of the first death star at yavin
you control everything  characters fighters troopers ships it is superb
the gameplay takes a  little getting used to but after a while it is easy
there is so much to  this game you control things send your fleets where you want them  transport your characters and send them on missions move rebel  headquarters everything
you deploy mines and refineries to make  production materials then build either ships troops or facilties from  those materials then use those ships to take over more planets
theres so  much i cant explain it all here but it is brilliant a must for all sw  fansi am one of pc gamers biggest fans and there are only a few of their reviews i have ever disagreed with
one of them was rebellion
garnering only a  i was immediately skeptical
but after playing it i realized that this game was one of the most addictive and fun games that i have ever played
people will tell you that the micromanagement will eat you alive
they say you have to quotclick here and here and here and here and here and herequot just to accomplish a simple task of building a ship
well sure you can do that if you take the long route approach to doing things
and once you get playing youll learn all the little shortcutsgraphics arent great but thats not what makes this game a winner
the gameplay is constant
it is frantic at times
should you send han on that sabotage mission or leave him to help lead troops into battle against an imperial system
and some characters are forcesensitive allowing them to be trained by luke or vader or the emperor once they reach a certain ranki cant list all the great features of this game here because of space
but this is the most addictive game that i have ever played
star wars fans will not be disappointed
strategy fans will not be either
it will not appeal to everyone though so if you really detest strat games dont buy it because it wont be your cup o tea
but despite the steep learning curve youll be enjoying it for months on endsome of the newer star wars strategy games ex force commander could learn some lessons from this great old title
i purchased this game upon first release and it has been a constant icon on every pc ive owned  since
i will not uninstall it ever
in fact the first thing i do after getting a new machine is to load this gamethe game is set in the star wars universe just after the empires defeat at yavin
you can take on the role of commanding the alliance or the empire the later being my favorite you cant play as the bad guys often enough in other gamesonce started your objective is simple colonize other worlds or bring them to your cause through diplomacy or flat out invade them and then win them over with diplomacy
just keep going until you have captured the other sides leaders and have deystroyed their basethe game is heavy on micromanagement and there is a bit of mouse work involved but all functions have short cut keys usually involving the shift or control keys
you can even name your ships and fleets which i love to doeach side has a specific strategy for playing and one will not work with the other
play as the empire and overwhelm the alliance with brute force and numbers
play as the alliance and youll find hit and run mission based tactics and diplomacy work bestresource management is a huge factor in the game
you can manage it yourself hard to do or you can delegate to your assistant
just make sure your maintence resources dont slip into the negative or youll start lossing personell ships and facilitiesthe graphics are reasonable but nothing to get excited over
the sound is ok with stuff right out of the movies but even with the best speaker system it still sounds like its coming out of a walkitalkie
game play makes up for any and all short comings howeverwarning to anyone wanting to run this game on windows xp
i have experienced some graphics problems which dont last long slight slow down and auto play problems better to launch from the menu after putting the cd in than using auto play
these issues are a slight anoyance and after the initial install i have had no problems with launching the game
the game has also never crashed on me using xpif your sw fan who really likes to micromanage and has no problem with lots of mouse work then this game is for you
in my book this game is second only to the original xcom which is the other mainstay on my pcsthis is yet another excellent installment in the xwing series and is a great example of where action games in general are going
one of the aspects i found most interesting about this game is that theres an actually story with characters to follow which makes missions a lot more  fun since you know where why and how you are where you arewhen  compared with the original xwing id have to say this one is better
dont get me wrong i think that xwing is a classic but its time is over
i can remember when i couldnt even believe that they could actually have a  d model even if it was just a few boxy squares of an imperial star  destroyer
now in xwing alliance you get to go up against darth vaders  shudder
super star destroyer the quotexecutorquot the same shop  which tailed han solo in quotthe empire strikes backquot
incredible  detailthe space chatter is also great with some very witty lines  throughout
when you accomplish your mission objectives you almost feel  like shouting a quotyahoo
quot yourselfthis is a another great  lucasarts game that no star wars fan came miss
buy it nowthere are some games that you play that just are quotgamesquot and not experiences
earlier titles such as the rebel assault games were as such
the gamer did not feel like they were actually quotdoingquot what was happening in the game
games such as quake and duke nukem and doom while entertaining are superficial and do not engross the gamerbut xwing alliance is different
where as tom clancys rainbow six changed the way we play first person shooters how many times did your palms sweat on missions that you could not be detected
 xwing alliance changes the way we play flight sims
this isnt a superficial space shooter that leaves the gamer hungry for more
in fact it is completely satisfying
the story is compelling the graphics are sharp the gameplay is never dull and the music is well star warsthe missions will leave you hooked for hours constantly forcing you to put off that paper that must be written or that supply report that was due on your boss desk three days ago
you are ultimately rewarded for your longevity and resourcefullness by hopping into the millenium falcon assuming the role of nien nunb or landoi never figured that one out and blasting tie fighters at the battle of endor
and if you think that the falcon didnt do much at that battle just wait until you fly the  missions of that battle and youll have a new respect for what lando did especially the very hard final mission of flying into the death star
expect to spend a few days herewhen you talk about multiplayer this game excells in all areas
you can log on and play solo against others or join groups and coordinate battles
all ships in the game can be flown in multiplayer i especially grew fond of the toscan fighter though nothing beats the shear power of the xwingoverall an excellent game
not only is it fun to play and enthralling but you actually at most points feel as if you are in the game
when you fail a mission and decide that you need to make your multiple jumps back home instead of just quitting the mission right then youll know how engrossing this experience really isstar wars xwing alliancethis gameis beautiful even for todays timei have just gotten the game a month ago or so and im still on it oo its awesome very very realistic dogfights and beautiful explosionsim a pretty good pilot myself and this is challangeing for anyoneand youre wingmen ai are so smart that they even steal youre kills if youre not fast enough d its exactly like being in a cockpit of a xwing and you get a sense that you need to protect youre fellow pilots and belive me they will protect youit hits the star wars feel right on the head  and it just doesent get oldyou can earn metals  ranks  pilot certifications and items for youre transport that you own in the game trust me it is well worth the money and if you are a self respecting star wars fan you would buy thisand the tie fighterssmart as hecki almost didnt buy this game because i am not a big fan of  quottomb raiderquot style games
but since i am an indiana jones fan i made the plungei really love this game
smooth gameplay great graphics and difficult puzzlesai just finished playing lucasarts latest indiana jones thriller and i am certainly amazed by it
i find it hard to believe that this excellent game has gotten so many poor reviews
come on people
dont we buy computer  games especially when theyre run offs of our favorite movies to try and  journey into another world
isnt that exactly what indy and the infernal  machine does
it great gaming at its bestthe only draw backs to the  game were a few errors such as appearing in a new level without any of  your items which include some infernal machine parts which are critical to  getting through most levels
aside from that the game is very goodso  whether youre dashing along a beach on a tropical island in the  philippines busting commies at  miles per hour blasted your way off a  soviet ship or hiking through snowy mountains youll find every level in  this game to be excellentsowhat are you waiting for
buy iti bought this game cause i had nothing else better to do
the pictures on  the back of the box looked cool and i like these type of games
im also a  big fan of shoot em up games like unreal tournament and half life and  rogue spear
but i also like good adventure gamesive played the  tomb raider series and i never liked it for some reason
like many of the  other people have stated earlier this game does beat tomb raider away
i  think the graphics are a lot better than tomb raider
i remember tomb  raiders puzzles were really dumb and the maps were sooooooooo huge that  finding a puzzle was a pain
its a little of the opposite with infernal  machinebasically you control indy and you run and jump and whip and  shoot and pick up artifacts for money and solve puzzles
you solve puzzles  by pushing things or pulling things or moving things or dropping here and  there
the idea is simple but its really funpros nice graphics  nice control with a gravis xterminator nice sound nice puzzles and  good storyline
many people have complained about how the controls suck
if you have a gravis xterminator you will have no problems
the default  buttons are setup up perfectly and youll never have to touch the keyboard  unless you are moving your mouse to save
also someone said that indy  moves too slow  i have not thought that at all
he runs and jumps with  good speed
im running on a  mhz celeron with a voodoo agp  with   mb of ram on x on  bit mode and i see no slow downs
i think  these people are playing on a keyboard or some lower end gamepad and  machine
the puzzles are pretty simple but not too easy
most of them  are logical but some i have had to go on the internet and look for  walkthroughs for this game
the first time i got this game it kept me  playing for  hours
i never play games that longcons one thing that  i found sucky was indys aiming
you do have a gun and you can shoot  spiders and german commies and stuff but his aiming is soooooooo awful
its like im standing point blank in front of a commie and i keep shooting  but i keep missing
if you do end up killing something youre guaranteed  to have lost a little health cause indys aiming sucks in this gameanother thing i found sucky was using the whip
i had a hunch you could  use the whip to climb
so i kept using the whip but he kept whipping  forward but not up to climb
so i was getting frustrated but i learnt that  if you stand in the right position and the camera angle shows where you can  latch onanother thing that sucked was that i didnt know you could  climb brick walls
that frustrated me
i was in this hole and i was like  quotman i cant get out
quot  then i read the walkthrough and it  turns out that you can climb up brick walls
go figurethose are  basically the only cons in the game
for amazons great price of  i  think youll be satisfied
its on two cds so its a long game and worth  your money
the game has never crashed on me and it runs smooth
this  game makes tomb raider look like crapi have been playing this game for over ten years now and i cannot get enough of this game
it is without a doubt the best indiana jones game ever the levels are long and full of puzzles and enemies left and right
the story is long and full of twists and turnsits very disappointing to me personally that people insist on moving forward when it comes to video games and quickly putting the gaming consoles of the past behind them forevercome on i grew up in the days of the nes when i was a child in the late s and early s
i was forced to play the same few games over and over for years because there wasnt much in the way of variety back in those daysbut you know what
i wasnt angry about that
not at all
this meant i learned to appreciate games for a lot more than just a couple hours of fun
i learned to accept video games back then for all the graphical flaws i encountered or any kind of gameplay problem
i learned to ignore all that stuff and just have fun playing the game and having a great timei see kids today who look absolutely determined to forget about the playstation  and  and buy whatever new video game console is cool these days
let me tell you something back in the s for at least four years it was considered very cool to own a playstation   this is because game companies kept pumping out one wonderful game after anothersure there were some average games on the ps and plenty of crappy games as well
but the same can be said for any video game console
why should we focus on the less than spectacular games when reviewing a video game system anyway
its completely pointless because all consoles have their share of average and terrible games
every single one of themsonys successful playstation console was just excellent if you ask me
making the decision to keep the ps for over  years now and not only play the console but keep the ps hooked up to my tv for all these years really means the games must have been good
and they are good
really good gamesin addition to having a cd player built into the playstation console for all your music needs i have to say the cd player is actually a step above most cd players out there because the one built into the ps is apparently a heavy duty player that can actually play through heavily scratched discs without a problemi put in an old stooges cd called fun house thats almost unplayable on other cd players but it works brilliantly in the ps
honestly the music cds work a lot better in the ps than they do in an actual sony cd player
i had a couple sony cd players that never played the discs right so in the trash without hesitation those cd players wenthow about memory cards
you can buy a memory card for less than  bucks for your ps console
i am totally serious about that
what a fantastic price to store your memory for your many video game adventures
trust me youll need a memory card for all the fairly long games available for the psim also sick to death of all these complicated video games out there today that require pressing too many buttons just to make the character perform an action that can easily be mastered on the playstation   no you do not need extreme and precise accuracy just to shoot a guy in the arm when you can perform a similar action playing a first person shooter on the ps such as the medal of honor seriesthat leads us to the ps controller
its a perfect controller in every single way
you can easily remember the buttons on the controller and where they are located in critical moments so you wont make any mistakesmost importantly its very easy to allow your fingers to reach over to another button and press it easily without any inconvenience
im talking about no problems doing so
this this is why the ps is a brilliant video game system
no annoying analog sticks getting in the way of your commands
no awkwardly placed buttons on the controller making your gaming adventure turn into a nightmare
none of thatall these games people criticize today for being old and unplayable such as the silent hill and resident evil series give me a break
you have to give these kind of games a chance so your brain and fingers can learn to adjust to the way they play and i promise youll learn to find that moving your character around is very easy
its all about giving things a chance and taking the time to understand the way they arethe playstation  has many extremely good games available that are pretty affordable and definitely playable
sure most of the games are slightly shorter than the games you will find on the wii ps or xbox but who cares
youll have so much fun playing them that youll probably be back to play through them again i guarantee it
i must have played through silent hill and castlevania sotn over  timesand no its not just rpg games that are worth playing either
plenty of shooting games that youll have a surprising amount of fun playing through such as the medal of honor and resident evil series silent hill dino crisis  quake ii doom mdk all kinds of mega man games and who knows what else
theres just so many games to choose through games that should be memorable for years and years and years
perhaps the very best game on the playstation is a platformadventure game called spyro the dragon
the best game ever made maybesimply put if you ignorantly write off the playstation  for being old and outdated and assume that means the games are unplayable you are flat out wrong in my eyes
all this fancy digital high def high resolution stuff available for your televisions just to play a video game makes me sick to my stomach
it means its alright for video games to be bad because as long as they look good people will buy them anyway
absolutely disgusting
buy the ps and start a collection of exciting gamesoh and that leads me to conclude that the coolest neatest greatest thing about the playstation  console is that you can buy one for under  bucks
 bucks for hours of exciting gameplay
count me inand heres three reasons whyone massive game selection
there are hundreds of titles to choose from
certainly youll find a few that you will enjoy playing
there are some real gems out there and you wont have to look hard to find themtwo low low prices
because there are so many games youll have no trouble finding games that are in the range thanks especially to the quotgreatest hitsquot seriesthree longterm staying power
sony has sold more playstation units than anything theyve ever made
and the cd format is always a superior way of storing information
and ask someone with a super nintendo if they can play those games on their n sorry they cant
but if you ever decide to get a ps your games are still goodgaming has come a long way since this system came out
my only regret is that i didnt get mine earlierfirst of all this is not a flop
i dont know who would hate this
there are so many good games like doom hexen duke nukem resident evil silent hill medal of honor twisted metal
but mine broke after  years of usage
the engine burned out and it would turn on but the discs wouldnt spin
so i suggest u get the new model to replace this one
or a ps
but if u find one of these in mint i garuntee it will workthe playstation is a great console for anyone
with hundreds upon hundreds of games this system is becoming very popular
i used to have a n which i grew to dislike because of their expensive games
the ps can play music cds and has many accessories including one which allows more than two people to playa great gift for people of all agesbefore i bought a playstation i had the following impressions of it long load times five minutes or soand major overheating problems
but now that i own a psx i know better
load times are only a couple of seconds or at the most under a minute
as for the overheating i guess it depends where you place your playstation
mines atop a cardboard box away from the satellite receiver and vcr
on the game metal gear solid a cd icon is supposed to appear if the system is overheating or something but that has never happened to me once
i normally play a game for  to  hours
one thing that i did notice though is that if you play a game for several hours then take the game out and put another one in you have to let the system cool down for an hour or two otherwise youll just get the main menu
the playstation has a great library of games
for rpg gamers theres the final fantasy series with its great graphics
the fmv sequences look like they came out of a bigbudget specialeffectsladen movie
n doesnt have such graphics not that ive seen
for action gamers theres metal gear solid vagrant story etc
tons of great games
remember its not the graphics that make a system worth having its the games
i dont have the analog controller but i love the regular controllers
they fit nice in your hand and all buttons are easily accessible unlike n
there are only two controller ports but i seldomly play two player games and never play four player games
the system itself is very durableive taken it to college several times and hooked it up to the tv during my threehour lunch
overall a great system but if mine broke sometime soon id probably save my money and wait for a ps although i would test the system firstsee how it runs your old gamesbefore making the big buyive been wanting a playstation  but this is just as good
sure the graphics arnt as good but for  its wroth itthe sony playstation was the first main console game to come out with cd games and the ability to play audio cds
this gave it the ability to hold more information than a normal cartridge game  and many games came in multiple cd packs
this equalled longer gameplay and more complexity than the n or sega systemsthe playstation one is a smaller version of the same unit  portable and soon to come out with a portable lcd screen
both play any game from the playstation one library
while cds do hold more data than cartridges they load a bit more slowly so often there is a second lag between scenes as the new scene loads into memorywhile nintendo games tend to be pixel based most playstation games are polygon based taking advantage of the playstations  polygonssec speed
this tends to make images sharper and scaleable
when something moves towards you its easy to calculate polygons compared to expanding pixelsthere is a good sized library of games for the playstation  quite a few racing games plus the tomb raider series the final fantasy series abe spyro the dragon and more
the games for the playstation tend to be for teenagers and adultsweve had a playstation since it first came out and for racing and sports games it is incredible
we find we use the n far more often when kids are around wanting to play somethingspecifications cpu bit risc clock speed  mhz sound cd quality channel stereo connector standard plug videoaudio connector  x   x  tv units resolutionafter giving it some thought i recently bought a psx dualshock system
having played the n it got boring for me due to lack of rpgs
there is  not one decent true rpg title for the n
quest  was a total piece of  garbage and zelda for me is just a over hyped ho hum gamewith the psx  there is the ff series various square soft rpgs upcoming dragon quest  vii and many more titlesavailable
i got frustrated with the lack of rpgs  for the n and hearing about all the awesome ones for the psx
rpgs has  always been my favorite type of game to play
the first rpg i ever played  was dragon warrior on the nes
that game really got me hooked on  rpgquots everybody that i know has a psxand they really it a lot
the  fact that the games are on cds hold more memory than cartridge really  swayed me towards the psx
the only drawback is that you need to buy memory  cards for adventure amp rpgs
i like the design of the psx it can also  play your favorite cds
the n may have better graphics and sound but  that alone cant make a fun game
dont get me wrong n is a good system  and so is the playstation
psx has a lot of the mature games
something the  n has very few of anyway
the psx dual shock controller does not need  batteries unlike the ns
i havent bought a decent game for the n in  a while and maybe wont for a while
there is no hope for the n not in  my mind anyway
maybe there will be rpgs for the starcubenintendos new  system but who knows
nintendo has gone out of their way to make more  mature games and thats a good thingmyself im in my s and i like to  see more mature graphic scenes and four letter words
in closing i would  like to say that im sure glad i bought a psx
the library of games is  immense and there are loads of rpgsbut i have not given up on the n  maybe they or somebody else will make a decent rpg
yeah right
hails to  all the true rpg gamers out thereit was early i thinkand i was hanging out with some socalled friends
we were in my schools gym when our discussion turned to the topic of video games
up til then my experiences with the gaming industry had been with the nes and game gear with the occasional game boy snes and n when i visited my cousins
one of my uncles owned almost every major console in the s but he never let us younger nephews touch any of his equipmentanywho i was talking with my friends and they asked me what game system i owned
i replied none
i dont have one rather sheepishly
none
one questioned confused
wow i thought everyone had one
he promptly shrugged it off though and continued conversing with the othersbut i didnt shrug it off so easilythat night or some time that week since my memory fails me i approached my mother and told her i wanted a video game system
the next day i came home to a playstation sitting on the living room entertainment centeryeah rightshe told me if i wanted one i can buy it myself
i had been saving for a gokart for a while but as the years dragged on my interest in one dwindled
i decided to use that saved currency for a system instead
i thought i had the money so that wasnt the issue the real problem was deciding what to buyfor a while i debated getting a saturn over the playstation
sega had built itself quite the name at the time and sony was new to the market
i knew more sega titles like sonic since i had a game gear but then one day at a friends house i played a demo disc and there was a sole winter level starring this strange orange creature as the protagonist
i fell in love with it instantly and when i discovered it was a playstation exclusive it was then that i declared which console to purchasemy mother and i paid a visit to our local toys r us which was where i bought most of my game gear miscellany
we went to the games department and i saw the graysilver box in all its glory
but its price wasnt so glorious to me a child of elementary education
i was devastated when i learned id have to save a little more if i wanted to get the console a game and an extra controller in one fell sweepthat following summer when my schooling was done and i had saved enough money we returned to the giraffes domain but to my dismay the consoles no longer were available
i was defeated once again
a tru rep informed us that the reason was because they were ridding their current stock and werent getting more in until next week when a fresh wave of a boxed console with an updated controller would arrive
we could come back then and checkmy mother was tired of going back and forth and not finding what i wantedi was quite the persistent whiner after alland goaded me into waiting till christmas if i did shed buy me an additional gamebut i didnt want to wait
santas day was an eternity awaynext week we returned and sure enough to the tru employees word the new console was there
dualshock was imprinted boldly on the box in strong red colors
that meant little to me as i had no idea what that meanti took the slip of paper that informed the cashier i was meaningful with my purchase and went to find that game with the strange orange creature and there it was crash bandicoot  cortex strikes backmost of the games i played at my cousins were coops thus i thought id need a second controller
but the firstparty sonys were out of my price range forcing me to settle on a rdparty clear controller without analog sticks
clear stuff was all the range in the s but to this day i have to get a clear controller for every system because of that initial purchasewhen i got home and opened the box i realized what dualshock meant
the controller was much different than my friends and i quickly preferred it over other padsthis fauxreview has gone on long enough so ill try and speed things upi played my new console nonstop for some time spending hours upon hours with crash and the included demo disc in the consoles box but couldnt get very far as i didnt buy a memory card
i didnt know id need one even though the tru rep said i would
my nes didnt need one my cousins snes didnt need one
but the ps did and i had to save up for thati bought every crash title for the ps and spent many dollars at blockbuster renting various titles
i grew to love final fantasy bloody roar tomb raider tomba croc ape escape spyro and many other fantastic series because of sonys initial console and have gotten every one of their consoles sincewhen the ps was released i of course bought it and gave my old gray buddy to my kid sister never caring to look backlast summer that same sister bought herself a used ps to use as a relaxer during college and it was then that i started developing a sharp interest in old consoles and games
i asked her about our old ps and she said the reason she bought a ps was because the ps had been failing but that she couldnt remember where she stored ita month ago she texted me a picture of a stickercovered gray machine
i picked it up the following weekend cleaned it and tested some titles
unfortunately some games dont read at all like croc while others like crash  work flawlessly
theres definitely some lengthier loading time than if i played the same disc in my ps but theres something about the lower graphical output and using the original dualshock that trumps playing the same game on the psperhaps its nostalgia perhaps its empirical proof
i dont know but all i know is that i love my playstation and am glad to be opening its disc tray once again
it turned me from a casual gamer into a video game connoisseurfor us nintendoplay station junkies this is a must for the original games
this is in great condition
would recommendspent many a sleepless night playing this game
they finally got it right
if you ever thought you could build the best roller coaster and wanted to see what its like to actually ride it you gotta get this game
its so much fun to walk around in quotcamcorderquot mode and check out  the park youve built
plus getting on a ride and watching all these  doeeyed chubbycheeked kids screaming their heads off too funny
great nonviolent nonstop entertainment
make sure youve got a decent  system  at least a p and a good d card as it does start to slow down  once the park fills upthis game has a lot of sentimental value to me
i was about  at the time of purchase 
really enjoyed unlocking the various islands in the game and building them out with seemingly endless possibilitiesaesthetically there is something magical about the game
the island themes rides characters color palette all very intriguing
the art style is very cartoonish but the gameplay is fairly realistic for a kids game  well balanced overallthis is a kids game that happens to be quite enjoyable even for adults due to the economic aspects of the game ie
managing the park budgeting of staff training etc
i would recommend the game for early to mid teens and even adults looking for a temporary reprieve from reality
you wont be disappointeddiablo is one hell of an outstanding game
i loved it as soon i started playing it
the treatment of horror in the game seems so authentic
this is a classic rpg
the story deals with the same old theme  the forces of good against evil
there are three basic character types  the warrior the rogue and the sorcerer wish there were more each with unique characteristics
you choose to be any one of them as you begin your quest against not any mere evil but against the lord of terror diablo himself
as u venture deep into the labyrinths u come across books enlightening the story of the mysterious dark lord who with the help of his two brothers mephisto and baal plans to resume the sin war between the gates of heaven n hellthe number of characters u interact with in the game is limited but conversations with each makes things clearer and makes room for subplots
u also get to talk to a few demons
dealing with the demons in itself is an experience
god
this game is so scary
i like the whole feel of the game  the gothic tale of terror the gloomy labyrinth the sinister sounds heard in the background and finally the dark unholy figures creeping in on u from all sides add to the whole eerie atmospherethough the action in the game gets repetitive after sometime it is very addictive and real fun
the controls in the game are very simple in the sense that you just point n click at the demons and smash them to pieces
though combat has been made simple it involves a lot of strategy coz at times u are attacked by hordes of demons of various types from all sides and u would wish that u had this great machine gun to blast themtalking about weapons the blacksmith provides u with quite a number of medieval weapons to pick from
there is the axe scimitar mace morning star sword falchion bow blade dagger club sabre flail and hammerjust to mention a few and each comes in varieties with various attributes
and the sorceress has a range of spells n staffs to offer for a price
also once you are done with the demons in a particular labyrinth u can look around for weapons they were carrying n other things lying around such as armor amulets and rings
conversations with the blacksmith and the sorceress help a lot as to which weapon will help u vanquish which type of demonanother thing is that each time u start a new game u enter a different labyrinth
nothing good or bad about it as the labyrinths and the demons look the same anyway even though u have a different map each time only that u have to be on the lookout for demons creeping out of new areas
it is just like serving the same food in a new dish each timeall in all this is a great rpg
diablo offers a spinechilling experience
every fan of the horror genre should give this game a try
this game is so addictive that diablo ii is out of question for another couple of monthsi have had diablo for about  or  years now and i still play the multiplayer i even play the single player occasionaly
exploring dungeons killing hideous monsters getting stronger and learning new abilities has never been so fun
theres only  character classes but there cool character classes
youv got your strong and brave warrior you have your incredibly accurate master of archery the rouge and you of course have to have the magic dude the sorcerer
the game offers great challenges however some of the bosses were easy especialy diablo
im not saying i didnt break a sweat when fighting him i just expected him to be stronger
uh but when you meet the butcher be ready to get very mad because you will probably die the first  fights remember to save your game often
multiplayer can be really fun but somtimes those stupid hackers ruin everything
if you download anti crashes protects you from being crashed or god mode  invincibility that keeps you from being killed by other players the hackers wont bother you too much thus letting you have a much funner game  i havnt played diablo  but i have watched a friend play it and it looks great
ill have to buy it somtime
oh and if you like gore in your games theres alot of it in here
like when you kill a zombie its body parts fall off and some flesh and blood splatters on the wall or when one of those horned demons die their chest splits open and blood just goes everywhere
and dont think the dungeons and all the other levels are going to be clean and happy because they are made up of bodys heads arms and everything stuck on spikes or dead bodys chained to walls
and its kinda disturbing when you walk into the butchers kitchen because theres blood organs and body parts scrawled all over the floor
this is definatelly not a game for kids at all
the graphics and sound are good considering how old the game is
this is no doubt one of the best rpgs to ever grace the pc
a must buyi just read a review that said that they had just gotten to level  and said that everything looks the same as it did in level one and there absouletly right
but had they played one more level he would have entered the catacombs a whole new enviroment with different and harder mosters better weapons new spells and more expierience to gain
and its not those are the only two areas either  even i would have thioght it would have been crappy then theres also the caves and hell
so please to you diablo naysayers or any body planing on getting the game just beet it up to the caves  i would be very certain you would change your mind about it
also ive played diablo  and must say i was impressed but i only got to level  so im dont really know enogh to give my two cents about it
and especially for anyone considering buying diablo consider the following  i own the following games age of empires  the sims deluxe edition medal of honorallied assaultand the breakthrough expansion age of mytholigy grand theft auto  just to name a few
i only listed those because there some of my best games
and listen to this diablo beats em all
battlenet isnt bad either
in fact thats how i came about my copy see a friend of mine gave me a burnt copy hoping to play multiplayer with me
and we did for  hoursthis is the first game blizzard released that i bought and boy what a choice
the grahpics are wht got me to keep checking out this game but a guy i worked with kept telling how awesome this was and how awesome the online play was
and i tell you what
this game was awesome all the way through
turning every corner not knowing what was there and then being attacked by horde after horde of every kind of monster imaginable this game continually kept my adrenalin pumping
the final fight with diablo in the end was alot tougher than the one in diablo and was a very challenging game
 character classes to choose from and many weapons magic items and shields to choose from
this is one of the best games ever released and a must for any gamerdiablo is a addictive game that will hang u up all day in front of that darn computer
you can choose between warrior strong but little magic rogue in between and sorcererweak but lots of mana
the single player game isnt much but multi player makes up for this
buuuuuuuuuuut in multiplayer other poeple hack to get good stuff boot you and kill you without warning called pks hated by most and undefetead by others
however when you get strong enough you can stop others from doing these cheap things
diablo also comes with something that i looked forward to and you should to you will never play the same game twice
the levels you go to are always different in a different game
and if you find yourself under heavy attack go back to town where no one fightsyou cant i often go thereso the part you want me to talk about is hereprosnever the same game twiceaddictivegood graphicsthousands of weapons sheilds armors spell books ect ectdifferent characters provied different planning of how you strom diablos fortressconspks and hackers ruin multiplayerto hard for beggining characters who dont have many spells and stuffsooooooooooooooooo with that over you know ive been typing this forever and i dont wanna wast my time so just listen to me and buy it
you will honor the day you do as a holidayhehe
you might not but you might want to
sorry i have a game to play that you didnt buy yeti havent played this game in several years and picked it up a couple of weeks ago
the reason i picked up this game over everything else is that it is soooo cheap
what other game offers so much for ten bucks
the best thing about blizzard is battlenet which is free after you purchase the game
this adds so much value to this game and really makes it a lot of fun to play
it doesnt take long to find some companions and go into the dungeons killin uglies
sometimes you need to look out for the player killers but there is always somebody there willing to help somebody outanother good thing is that it doesnt require much knowledge to play
just play it for a few minutes and then it all makes sense
its ease of use of the features is a very strong plusfinally the replay value is enormous
the dungeons are never the same and there are many quests you can go on to keep on challenging youa great game
it has an m for its violence and gore but this rating really surprises me as there is no blood and the graphics are not that detailedi bought diablo when it was first released back in  and to this day i still find myself playing it
i have solved it numerous times but i never tire of it
i just create a new character and start from scratch
whether it be a warrior rogue or sorcerer it is fun playing as each character and finding the strengths and weaknesses for each character
even though diablo  has since been released the original diablo is still fun
the graphics may not hold a candle to the games on the market today but in the end all that matters is fun and diablo is just that fun
if you are looking for a game to play while passing the time between blockbuster releases then pick up a copy of diablo if you dont already have itthis is the classic diablo game that ive been looking for since my old copy was destroyed in a fire a few years ago
the game was as it stated in the description new and still unopened not used which is hard find since blizzard no longer makes copies
the only issue i had was nothing the game itself but with windows
it seems that window has issues running this old of a game
it took a while a looking on the internet but finally a friend showed me to get diablo running on windowsyou have to to right click on your desktop go to select personalize change the back ground to high contrast   once that is done then do the same thing but this time select the screen resolution and leave it open
then run the game as normal and youll be moneydiablo is now looked on as the classic rpg that brought great storyline and replayability to the world
its still as fun as it was when it came outits hard to remember now with so many dark games out but diablo was really one of the first that had truly evil forces to contend withthe graphics might be a little blocky compared to current day games but its still amazingly fun to play
the levels that are different each time you play the various character classes the assortment of armor and weapons you pick up all add up to great fun both the first time and tenth time you go throughplus with on line play you can build up a character and head through quests with your friends from around your neighborhood or around the worldif youre a fan of diablo  dungeon siege or other hackandslash rpgs you really might want to pick up diablo and see where they all came from
you should be able to find used copies of the game pretty easily and even buying it new is at a discount pricereally a great classic it works fine but there are rainbow color issues that battlenet has a fix for you have to play it as a tiny window in the middle of the screen but given the game play is pristine as it always was i cant complain i just adore this gamediablo is the first computerbased rpg that i played and by far defined what i expect in such a game
the gothic fantasy is dark and makes you feel as though you are truely fighting evil
i remember that i became very attached to my character and always wanted to develop it further
the story is decent but what makes it is battlenet which was introduced with this game
i spent many hours of my ninth grade year four years ago playing this game at night online with my friend
we would adventure for hours just killing all the evil foes in our way
it can seem repetitive and very much hackandslash but still it is very very addictive
especially since this game is now so inexpensive i would suggest it as a good buy for someone with many hours to spend developing a characterthis game created a genre and no game ever topped the original
this was from a time when games were challenging and beating them was an accomplishment rather just an investment in time
upgrades to your gear could randomly drop from any critter so every kill was exciting and death could always be around the next corner
i recommend this to any gamerare you looking for a challenging game
are you looking for a game that has a good storyline
then this game is the one for you
this game gets harder and harder for every level you go to
at first its a small change but once you get to the final levels of the game the difficulty becomes apparent
a must playbest game on the market when it came out
i spent an entire vacation playing this game
i got my wife hooked on it and ewe both have played it  for  years
i am usually bored to tears with a game in a few months
this lasted for  years and wellnow it is losing its glamourbut i  have informed my boss i am taking a couple extra days off when diabloii  hits my computerif you have not already noticed diablo is easily located within dungeons and dragons
this is actually a benefit for diablo since it has very little story going on
this rpgaction hybrid is nice and its multiplayer community is huge
too bad there are millions of cheaters
just be legit and everyone else will catch on
the game offers lots of fun
not many complaints though
they are really your choice as to if theyre bad or good
get the game if you want
not a wasted moneythe story of diablo is based on premise of a war between heaven and hell
the town of tristram is under attack by demons and the player must save the town
as the player delves into the underworld he discovers more about the demon diablo through large tomes that are read aloud by the character
eventually the player reaches the lair of diablo and must kill himthis is a great and challenging game ive wasted countless hours playing this incredible game
i would highly recommend it to any blizzard fan and anyone who started the diablo series with the rd installment
great gameultimate adventure game
blizzard has the best team of programmers ever
i mean come on starcraft
warcraft
they are all great
diablo has got to be one of my favorite gamesdiablo is a sweet rpg game with a terrifing setting
in this game you play a brave knight who goes down to the catacombs and fight evil satanlike demonic creatures
this game is not for the seven year olds or the younger
so if you kids at home are reading this review dont ignore this because let me tell you this game will honestly scare you
this game is bloody because you cut off arms and not to mention in one quest you find a guy sitting in a pool of blood
it is also somewhat disturbing because of the helllike settings after you enter the under worldthe interactions between your character you can chose between three types and the enemiesallies is very funny and entertaining at times
i got a bit bored with having to go back and forth between levels at times  the goat guy and his special item isnt really worth going back for
clearly the ending of the game is set up for continuation of the basic worldplot
i was anxiously awaiting the next edition after i won this game a few times
with it had a balance of male to female characters thoughbefore i write my review i want to make sure you know that i played diablo ii before i played diablo which screwed my experience with diablo in some respects hated not having the running ability already knew my characters fate couldnt highlight items on the ground etc
but otherwise i am not biased for or against this gamei got this game in early  i would spend all day at it the i would get up and play it at night sometimes even affecting my performance at school
so it certaintly is addictive to say the least
as i mentioned earlier i played the demo the the full version of diablo ii first so i did have those complaints i mentioned above
but had i gotten into rpgs earlier i probably would not have anything against this game
except for the running thing i hate it when i have to chase the archergoatmen down endless corridors sometimes leading me unexpectedly into another horde of enemies without having any other option than chasing him
arghh thats got to be the most annoying thing in the whole game second to forgetting to save and then dying forcing you to replay a portion of the game over which is really annoyingbesides for that and considering it was made in  i give this game an excellent rating
i mean any game that makes me stay up all night has got to be good for somethingalthough by now diablo is beginning to show its age in the gaming industry it remains one of my favorite games of all times
the combat system is very well done in which you choose your armor weapons magic ringsamulets and spells in a menu and can change these based on what you go into combat with
the countless possibilities of combinations are numberless and there is a slight variation in quests each time you playthe theme is basically a medieval one in which you venture deep into an underground labyrinth to battle monsters and such that youve heard about and you end up having to face monsters of mammoth proportions the butcher magical skill lazarus and a combination diablo
the game really shouldnt be intended for kids that are at an age where gore and such could sicken one as there are themes of death sacrifice and unholiness in the gamei found the game very enjoyable however and at the moment its at a bargain price
if you have played diablo ii already youd probably like the first diablo although diablo ii is much better
id still suggest playing the first one before taking on diablo ii
there are numerous spells and such that you can learn to aid you on your quest and items appear randomly after battling monster bosses regular monsters with special powersie
one with magic resistances
the game implores you to learn the lay out of the dungeon and you begin to press deeper into the valleys of heckthe degree of difficulty is not too bad where after you get used to the game you realize that all you really need is time to beat it and plenty of saves
the usefulness of the shops and magic items also turns the tides against darkness in your favor
id recommend this game to anyone whos out of elementary school and doesnt mind the gore and violence to reach a game with great gameplay and a relatively detailed storyline with interesting questsas levant or whatever you name him you make your quest to save your village from the locuse of apocalypse
going into forests and catching fierce beasts to protect yourself and others is a journey for the strong
you can even catch beasts and merge them with others
so if you want a game thats like pokemon with a awesome twist by this gameyes you do fight with monsters and yes you are a kid
but this game has a rich storyline with many character relationships
different from pokemon you can fight yourself
although the graphics are bit out dated they still look awsome and the anime videos are fantastic
the music works well with the game and the voices of the characters are well placed for those who dont want to read
overall its a great game and well worth the moneythis is a true classic
players assume the role of a cocoon master in a remote village plagued by roaming monsters and folklore
unravel the story of the tamamayu as you hunt raise and combine monsters for summoning in battlethis is one of the very few rpgs ive played more than three times
the other notable mention is final fantasy vi
if you take pokemon strip out  of the childish nonsense give it beautiful music dreamlike landscapes a plot character development and interresting monsters that can take on a multitude of forms you get jade coccoonjade coccoon has a dreamlike fairytale quality that i enjoy
there is character development and an actual plot
the sound track is beautiful i wish i could find it
the character po tells some good stories the first about alcana is the best which is a nice diversion
my favorite element of the game is that there is no clear good guy and bad guy there is conflict on both sides
it also touches on some theological questions in an interresting way
the graphics are also quite good for a playstation game and actually add to the mood and setting rather than just act as flashy eyecandymy only problem with this game is that it seems slightly rushed in development
there are elements in the story that seem as if they will be developed and they just go away
there is also a slight bug if you save a game while carrying firefly coccoons and turn off the playstation when you restart the special abilities and spells of the creatures in the firefly coccoons will be erased
however sometimes this works to your advantage for breeding
purified coccoons left with mahbu are safe
the game has also crashed three times on my ps twice when levant is summoning the first minion of a fight but for  hours of play that isnt badthis game brought back so many memories it came in the condition that was in the description
it worked perfectlystarsiege tribes is by a hiroshima the best game on our planet
there is so much i repeat so much to do in the tribes universe
one problem with the game that is a problem but once you play youll forget no single player
the multiplayer is so good that this game should be called bubba and halo and all those other games should be renamed bubbas
for  or less you cannot beat this
get it
absorb it
die a happy gamer
you will not regret it my friendsi agree
i have bought many games and i have found quottribesquot to be one of the best
with hundreds of servers great graphicsand gameplay how could you go wrongthe game itself has a very neat idea
the game is mainly for team play
and if youre like me this is the kind of game you have been waiting for where you get together with a team and have large bases with turrets and  different types of weapons and armor that add to the actionthere is two  really neat things about it
one is the size of the maps
it takes about   minutes to run from one end to the other making it very enjoyable for  team play
the other is not only can you play as a st person view with a  gun but you also have access to ships in which you can pilotfly
you  can have an ordinary fighter or you can pilot a dropship which yourself and  others can transport yourselves to the enemies basethe action in the  game is very fun indeed
you have to penetrate the opponents base and get  inside with out being killed by the team mates and the turrets
once  inside you take out weapon generaters and armor disposels
if you succeed  in destroying all their main targets your team winsvery strategic and  definitly fun to play with friends on network lan or the internet
this is  definitly a mustbuy if youre a st person fantribes is awesome
probably the best thing about the game is the fact that everyone can get whatever weapon suits them best
the games where you have to find the guns kinda get old because if you dont find it you get  killed trying to
the stratagy is probably the most incredable thing about  the game
it sounds so simple capture the flag but there is so much you  can do
talk with you team to create a diversion or simply go kamakazi  with the scout
this game is by far one of the best stratagy games out  there
probably the best part about it is the phrases
they are great
byestarcraft stands the test of time as a strategy game extraordinaire
it is not just the trio of the zerg protoss and terran with their well balanced arsenals
it is the whole plot and atmosphere which shinestarcraft was one of the first strategy games i played where i got swept up into the storyline and became fond of the individual character types
even many years later i still refer to the zerglings and remember the behavior of the individual troop typesthe game is incredibly fun just in single player mode moving through the missions refining and perfecting your skill with each of the three groups
where it shines for me though is when you take it into multiplayer and take on other humans
the possibilities are pretty much endless
with all the troop types and the various ways to use them you can always find a fresh interesting challengewe definitely own games that we played once had a fun time doing so and then put the game away never to be touched again
we have games that we wrote five star reviews when they came out but barely remember them several years later
this is not the case with starcraft
we adored it when it came out we kept playing it and even years later we are strong advocates of the gameperhaps the only trouble you could have in modern times is that because the game was released for windows  and windows nt you might have difficulties playing the game on a justreleased system
the game is after all from  however i just tested the game out on my  laptop which is running windows vista
it ran without a problem
i logged into battlenet and there were currently  starcraft games running
im not sure how many other  year old games you could find this kind of enthusiasm forare there any downsides
sure the graphics are a little blocky compared with current high def games
still the minute i launched into my zerg world i was oblivious to any minor issues with the older resolution
the underlying plot and gameplay were all there
the same is just funhighly recommendedwe purchased starcraft with our own fundsstarcraft does fall into the rts genre resource gathering unit creation base building ect
but it isnt as demanding for a strategic genius as games like age of empires or rise of nations
nonetheless its an explosive game that will keep you busy for a long time
in a way starcraft is a great change of pace for fans of more complex rts games like me
playing rise of nations all the time can start to get overwhelming because of the constant mass and micro management needed
in starcraft you dont have to deal with a ton of diplomacy issues or anything like that
a typical game has things set up kind of like an rts death match
all of the resources you need are sitting right next to your base
collect them build defenses then build an army
you can choose from three different races
the terran a human army of colonists zerg a race of bugs mutants and everything creepy and crawley and the protos a super intelligent race with psionic powers
each race terran zerg protos have their one advantages and disadvantages
the terran are well balanced and are best for beginners
they have good infantry and a variety of defenses
one good advantage is that important terran buildings command centers barracks ect
can lift off the ground and fly to a new area for a quick escape
the zerg rely on the masses
their units are not as powerful but they are also less expensive and some are created in groups
one of their disadvantages is that they cannot build mutate on normal ground only on a thick slime that covers the ground near their buildings
the protos have very powerful units but they are more expensive and take longer to build
a huge advantage for the protos is that they dont have to sit at a construction site and waste time building it up
all you have to do is get one of your little probes to warp the building in
the second the probe reaches the building site they actavate a portal and the building basically starts to build itself allowing the probe to tend to other matters
as a side effect they cant repair damaged buildings
the sounds are nothing to make a whole extra section about zap boom kerpow gimme somethin to shoot
but theyre what you would expect from a game like this
the music also fits the mood perfectly
the graphics are about the same as age of empires ii with a slightly more animated look making everything look and run smooth
its hard to tell how good the ai is because of the simple tactics they use launch waves of troops at your enemies and destroy them all
the ai also loves to rush
expect to be attacked about five minutes into the game
along those lines the computer does very well
the environments are very interesting and original covered with black dirt craters strange animals and purple trees
starcraft also has a great and free online multiplayer with an endless number of people to play withthere are many real time strategies to choose from and most of them are much more complex in gameplay and in graphics
but folks i have to say that i have found no rts that is more fun and addicting to play than  starcraft
since broodwar was released the game is even more fun
the  single player components are very entertaining and the story line is top  notch
i want to emphasize that because it is one of the best qualaties of  the game
the multiplayer part of starcraft is what keeps me playing
i am  really wondering if this game will ever get old to me but it hasnt yet
this game is perfect for somebody who wants a game for the funfactor and  replayablitythis is an amazing game
i was first intriduced to it when at camp they said they were having a starcraft tournament
i had never played starcraft but being myself i entered anyway
i practiced single player for  a matter of minutes but i was distracted and only learned about marines and scvs
i got crushed in the tournament obviously but after playing some more i started to get it and now i play  on battle net as often as my high speed internet is not too fast for every one elsesalmost never
my point is however that starcraft takes five minutes to learn but five years to master
even the champions still practice alot
the nail on the coffin for this game after the multiplayer capabilities is the great campaign mode
it is not recgognized however starcraft has one of the greatest storylines a game has ever had
thats why i rated this five stars and it certainly is the best game i own maybe the best game everi rate this game only second to total annihilation for rts game though this game combines graphics sound gameplay and story better i liked the free downloads of units better and just had more fun playing itbut this game is awesomethis game is the most beautiful game ive ever played
the detail of the units the sounds the graphics are very well done
not to mention the fun factor of playing against online players
this game encourages you to think on your feet and develop different strategies to annihilate your opponent
of all the games out there i would suggest this game
get the expansion set too
its a must have for playing with even more units with different skillsive been playing this game since  and have been playing ever since
i was hooked on quake for a while
if you want to use your intelligence rather than just merely blasting away at foes this game has your name on itcheckout online strategy guides to help you with your game
good luck and happy huntingif youre looking for a good strategy game look no further
simply put this is one of the top  real time strategy games ever madesingle player is very fun and most recommended for the very beginners
but completing the single player is completely unnecessary for it doesnt begin to prepare you for the extraordinary online gaming experience
although playing online is free i would gladly pay the price of this game as a monthly fee if need be
a little about the game you start off with a single building for your base
as the game progresses you build yourself a bigger base and depending on the game typewhich there are plenty of you make forces to attack and defend
too much fun to be able to explain whygraphics   would be  when this first came outgameplay   very smoothe even with konlineonline play   the best of the bestoverall   get this game if its the only game youll ever own
ive replaced my cd  times now in  years because of extensive gameplay
the price is righter than right i would have payed x the pricestarcraft is and will always be the defining strategy game
its easy access interface and the quick pick up on controls alows this game to be great
the best part about this game is its multiplayer capabilities
blizzard has given starcraft players the ability to make their own games
everything from tag to chase to movie contests are held on their free servers
i dont like to give  stars that easily but this game is the definition of funlets get one thing straight
i am biased
i love this game
i would even go so far as to say it is my favorite game
if that makes you mad then  thats your problemfirst off we have the graphics
they are not d  accelerated but they are very good and they get the job donenext we  have the sound
id have to say that it is the best sound in any strategy  game although total annihilation comes close in music anyway the music  is very good and fits each race
the terrans have a sort of rousing  warmovielike tune the zerg have a wierdsounding alien like one and the  protoss music is appropriately mystical
the sound effects fit the  situation
gooshy biological sounding suff for the zerg mechanical for  the terran wierd futuretech for the protossultimately though those  are just the bells and whistles
the gameplay is where its at and that  is where starcraft truly excels
the biggest innovation here is the truly  different races
in past games can you say warcraft 
 the opposing  forces have the exact same units with different looks
in starcraft they  are really unique
every side has its strengths and weaknesses and there  are no real equivalent unitsevery different matchup whether it be  protosszerg or terranprotoss requires a different strategy
the terrans  are mobile and do well in combinedarms the protoss are durable powerful  and expensive and the zergs are numerous and frail
the singleplayer game  plays out well with a ten mission campaign for each race
the campaigns  are played out in a set order terranzergprotoss why
so you can follow  the story
yes there is a story and it is very good too unlike most  realtime strategy games
once you finish the single player game then you  can go online to blizzards free internet service for some of the best  multiplayer action there isstarcraft is easily the best thing to come  from the gods at blizzard
it is the best realtime strategy game  available
barnoneif you have played activisions dark reign you will love this one
many of the features and commands are similar
graphics are great with some cool special effects
all the units are small enough so playing on a small  monitor wont take away from the viewable battlefield
reasource and troop  management are not complex like many other games of this type
you will not  have to memorize many complex keyboard shortcutsunless you want to  because the mouse is used for most of your input commands
starcraft still  holds its own after almost  years from the release date
i highly  recommend starcraft for those who enjoy a good strategy gamethis really is a great game
when it first came out i was burned out on realtime strategy games having played warcraft  to death
i played the first  starcraft missions then gave up on it
partly my nerves were  shot  rts does that to it
its a very frenetic type of game with lots  of rapid clicking scrolling around on the map trying to keep it all under  control
you have to hold a lot of stuff in your short term memory and  in the harder levels the constant onslaught of enemy attacks tends to  make you forget what you were trying to do
this is one down side of rts  games in general and starcraft is no exception in this regarda month  ago i picked starcraft up again and ive been playing it ever since
although i still like the fantasy setting of warcraft better starcraft  really is a fun game
each of the  races has its own character and there  are a lot of units upgrades special abilities and compinations   permutations to make becoming and expert in the game a huge challenge
this is definitely a game you can sink your teeth into and get your moneys  worth out ofstarcraft is still among the best of the real time strategy games
i especially like the inclusion of three factions with different abilities requiring different strategies to succeed
get it with the brood war expansion and have funthis game is awesome
it is still topping bestselling lists after all these years
a great buygame is best
blizzard gave players almost full control of the game with staredit campaign editor and you can download new units from the only game that can beat starcraft is starcraft comming i played this game years ago and was hooked emmediately
blizzard has never let me down as one of thier customers and i will gladly pay full price for any of thier gamesas opposed to waiting for the game to hit the bargain bin
this game still holds true as an exciting experience single player or multi
i just bought a new computer and cant wait to play over the lan
this game is easily better than some of the games that are comming out lately
blizzard has such a user friendly attitude that they give you the option to copy the games multiplayer data onto  other computers to play on the lan unlike another game i purchased last week that wants you to buy a whole new copy to play in your own houseanyway the replay value for this game is higher than any i have ever played
this is one of the first games i ever bought for my pc and i love it still
the gameplay is great with  diverse races that demand various strategies to master
new units are eased into your missions and the game is easy to learn
the game doesnt necessarily boast screaming d graphics like todays market but then todays market isnt all that great
the game is pleasing to watch and listen to
the developers have included plenty of unit responses and command acknowlagments that you will not get bored clicking on your units
click on them enough times in a row and blizzards crew have added funny responses or strange saying to the units like in warcraft
the sound is awesome
the music is good never gets boring and keeps you in the actionto top it al off i think that blizzard is really devoted to thier fans and customers unlike some other greedy corporate shmucks
blizzard has always been on top of thier games online trying to make diabloii unhackable so players could enjouy it more
little things like that show and buyers notice these things
i will not hesitate to give them my money for warcraft or any of thier new games because they have a perfect track record with me so far
check out diabloii and the expansions for starcraft and diabloii
youll never be ripped off by blizzardstarcraft is one of the best combat  strategy games ever 
the basic game play is pretty easy to pick up and if you play the single player missions in order youll quickly learn the strengths and weaknesses of each troop type
then the fun really begins when you battle against real opponents across the internet
after you have played the single player missions youll have your favorite race terran protos or zerg
youll come up with your own tactics on how to deal with your opponents there is a huge online community out there defending the honor of each respective race
buy the game and come play
this game came out back in  and it is still being played now
few games can say they have that lasting appeal
starcraft is great on its own but starcraft really needs to be played with the expansion starcraftbrood war it adds more depth to both the game and tactics with new missions and new units
if you dont own starcraft instead of buying starcraft by itself buy the starcraft battle chest and get starcraft starcaft broodwar and strategy guides for both games
the battle chest is well worth the extrastarcraft was released years before i am writing this review but is still one of the most fun games ive ever played
actually this is one out of two of the only games ive ever rated as a star game on amazoncom
if youre reading this youre obviously looking into buying this game and finding out what its about and such
starcraft has so many dimensions that after years of playin im still addicted to the gamebasically starcraft is a game that uses the same type of formula found in a warcraft or age of empires type of game  you build a colony of units and buildings and attack your opponent
starcraft lets you chooese from  races  terran the human like race zerg the larva infested race or protos the highly evolved computer generated race
all of these races have units  all with there pros and cons
for example a zerg gaurdian can take out a whole terran defense of missle turrets but it cant attack air unitsscs first mode is single player where choose your colony and you go through a campaign for each race learning more about the wars of the races and having fun while doing it
also in single player mode you can play a custom match to practice your skills against the computer
overall the gameplay is great but there seems to be one flaw
a term called rushing where the opposing team can take out in early colony in a matter of minutes
they can easily rush into your base mainly protoss zealots and terran marines and attack you qucik enough to kill you and destroy all of your buildings while your still just getting started
the blizzard team tried to slow down rushing by making updates to the game and making it so that a user can only take  units at a time while retreating attacking etc
but it hasnt worked out to wellanother mode which is where you have alot of fun is multiplayer mode where you go online and play with other people from around the us asia uk or wherever you live
once you enter multiplayer mode youll have to pick a name and password
once youre done with that youll be put into a chatroom which is a great part to the game
when you dont feel like playing or if you just want to make friends in the game this feature has it
you can edit your bdy lists here send friends messages etc basically the whole aim sceanrio
another thing you can do in chatrooms is see how much your lagging which ill explain in a minute
lagging is when your computer is to slow to keep up with the connection and u make everybody suffer from your slow computer
dont worry though people who dont have slow computers can drop slow players disrupting a game and game creaters can boot slow people or lagging players or anyone they want
in multiplayer mode can choose forom a variety of types of games
from a comp stomp where you can d a bunch of other people take on  to  or  computers to v no clutter games and even down to v nrmin nr no rush but some people still dont listen to the rules
in a multiplayer game you can ally in an ffa free for all bs backstab and so on
this adds demension to the game making it harder to know who to trust and who to believe
games with diffrent rules and games called ums are made by starcraft players in the campaign editor mode
thats right you can make your own game on sc
all of them are fun for the most part but some ums games you may never be good atcampaign editor is the final mode in the game
ive never realy explored it too much because i never wanted to make a bad game and then people tell me its a bad game lol
in campaign editor you basically make your own ums game
its fun to a certain degree but i personally never got into itall in all starcraft is a fine release by blizzard
a classic game of its time that even today has thousands and thousands of players on them game at a time
hope you go and buy it cause its really cheap now and its good titles in realtime strategy gamesstarcraft didnt really set a new standard when it was release for graphics engine and gameplay
however as people played it they realized how perfect this rts title really was
easy to learn difficult to master
it retains its flavor and fun even after all these years and so many other titles that came out after ita great scifi rts game that should be in the collection of any fan of the genre
dont miss out and make sure you also pick up the expansion back brood warthis is a good rts although it comes in nd to age of empiresii
the races in this game are a lot more fun that those of age of empires
also their isnt as much resource starvation as in aoe
starcraft is also more fast paced and i think overall is a better multiplayer game due to battlenets easy play and go layout
overall this is the best real time strategy you are going to get for its  price on amazoncom pick it upokay im not much of a strategy fan i have played them all the big hits and the only one any good is the command and conquer series i didnt even bother trying this game in  i didnt like warcraft  or in  a friend showed it to me and i played it with himhe had a lan in his house and i have one now too and i tell you it is different then any rts i have ever played i mean i got so into it i stayed up till  in the morning playing it with him
i bought it the day afterhey it only cost s at most places
whoever said that is had a bad story on the single player is wrong
it is the most gripping story on a rts ever i promise it is a story of betrayel your allies might not be what they seem to be and it has main characters that you have to protect during most missionsit is not just a war between  factions
buy it  now go ill be waiting for you on battleneti love this game
i play it a lot still in  also getting the expansion makes it more enjoyablestarcraft is definitley the most addictive simple and fun games you can buy as well as the best value
the storyline is classic and the gameplay is simple yet engrossing
get tired of the main gamethe best part about sc is that it allows other scenarios which are essentially extra free games to be made or dled quickly and safely over multiplayer
in addition to blizzards versions hundreds of fanmade games are available all over multiplayer enabling for an excellent experience
from scv football to capture the flag to diplomacy youll find tons of fun things to play
sc is still updated and patched by blizzard after eight years which shows something greatyou wont be dissappointedi bought starcraft about three years ago and its still my favorite multiplayer strategy game
this is the best strategy game i think that is available now
you can chose from  different unique races and this game has an amazing storyline
for double the ammount of fun you can play on battlenet free multiplayer service
battlenet is what keeps this game going because you can play any game you like including paintball to deathmatches
this game is so amazing it even comes with a campaign editor so you can create your own games and play it with other people
i just wanted to say that i gave this game  stars because of its amazing graphics unique strategy free multiplayer service and a campaign editor
starcraft is still my favortie game even after  years
i say buy this gamethe story is incrediblethe sound is goodfunfactor is very goodall the  races is very diffrent from each othermultiplayer is good a must buyok
the single player game is easy
you can beat that in an hour
but you get hooked
i played each level probably  times before i finally started playing multiplayer
i played it so much my mom made me stop for a while
but does that stop me
no way
i still play it all the timethe only bad part of the game is the way hard to understand  campaign editor
im an expert at the game and im barely a rookie at campaign editor
everything is easy smeesy lemon peezy until you try triggers
but lets not talk about that
lets just say its one of those games that you just remember
its also has to be one of the best games ever createdive been a gamer for a long time and ive played my share of strategy games
i still keep comming back to starcraft for more
three perfectly balanced and yet very different races battle it out
theres not too much micromanagement to kill you but enough for you to feel a part of the race youre playing
i love to play the extra scenerios that they created for one time battles
you can modify them or even create your own from scratch
i just wish they had a random map maker
it would be easier then
you can however go online to blizzard and download tons of scenerios that other gamers made
while the graphics arent state of the art anymore they still are pretty nice
this game allows for both a strategic approach or the full rush type of battle
you have both land and air units and you harvest two types of materials vespene gas  minerals to build your structures and units
the campaigns are nice but after beating them twice i now just prefer to mix it up with the single scenerios
this is a must have of any strategy gamer who hasent yet tried it
brood war has some real nice upgrades that you will appreciate as well as the three new campaignsstarcraft brood war is twice as better than the origonal
zerg lurkers can tear up anything while devoureres devistate the air
the new dark archon that comes from the dark templar is sweet and i love taking over the oppenents units
the corsiar is fast and terrifying
the medic become prime targets because they stop their units from dying and the units keep killing mine
the graphics are sweet
the sound is awsome
the unit pathfinding isnt that good like most games but its better than what it was
all in all bargian at any price and it deserves  stars
buy itive had this game ever since it came out and it never gets old
i still play it more than most of my other games and on bnet people are always making new maps on the included versitle map editor
this game is a classic
it never gets old
looking forward to warcraft  and hoping a starcraft with its low requirements and amazingly quick pace starcraft and bw are imo the best computer games ever
with starcraft you have three races of equal abilities and power but are completely differentbw adds to the mix with  new units valkyries medics terran devourers and lurkers zerg as well as dark archons and corsairs protoss
on top of that the protoss can now access dark templars though their stats arent really worth the price and tech and both zerg and terran have new upgrades
bw also includes three new tilesets and three new critters yay
the races are still even regardless of what you may have read in some other reviews
also all the new units are useful imo except the dark archon and templar but im not a very avid toss player
medics make fields of marines and firebats that much more of an annoyance whereas lurkers will cut infantry down in seconds
corsairs are quick to fire and good against smaller groups and their disruption web is awesome when playing a terran tanker whereas the valkyrie is amazing for say tons of mutas
and the devourers spores help slow down the enemy firewith the new upgrades guardians become less a threat than they previously were to terrans and ultralisks are muuuch more usefulthe only thing that wasnt improved was the campaign
the story was close to the last and you could tell who the traitor was and who would die etc
the cutscenes arent even that great either
and by the end youre left with so few characters that you find yourself not caring anymore and wanting kerrigan to destroy all of them
but the never tiring multiplayer saves the game
and even though there werent too many new good player maps we still have huntersother than that though awesome game and i sure cant wait until blizzard releases news about starcraft 
if they dodthe brood war expansion pack is fantastic
youve only been playing half the game if your playing starcraft without it
the story line continues from the original starcraft with extra missions and new troop types
unlike other game expansion packs brood war actually feels like it should be part of the original rather than just being bolted onto it
if you love being terran then buy brood war just for the medic which heals repairs marines and other troops
medics are best used in pairs so they can heal each other few opponents can stand up under the onslaught of two medics and a full group of marines together they will do a lot of damage
if you love protos buy brood war for the dark templars who are not only permanently cloaked but can meld with another like templars to create dark archons who in turn have the mind control ability to steal units from your opponent
unfortunately if youre a zerg player like myself  the zerg dont do as well on the new troops
the devourer is a new air to air attack flyer
its a little expensive in both minerals and time evolves from a mutalisk compared to its damage
the lurker which evolves from a hydralisk is the only unit that can attack whilst burrowed
since no unit can move while it is burrowed the lurker becomes just a glorified sunken colony
its well worth buying this expansion packhere are the pros and cons of thisprosgreat graphics and soundawesome gameplay and a large variaty of fightersplayer vrs
comp or player vrs player in multiplayermany choose map settings melle etc
games to choose from in multigood for learning stratiegicsp
skillsall around funconsa lil too adictivebrood war brings new units missions storyline and lots moreif you enjoyed playing starcraft then you will enjoy brood warin fact i think anyone that owns starcraft should also own this expansion packbrood war is a great addition to starcraft
it gives a couple new fairly equal units to each of the  races
i think it improves gameplay and strategy alot
as a protoss fan dark templars and corsairs are a must
i play on battlenet and brood war is just more fun than playing with just starcraft
for the price brood war is a great adition to starcraftbest online gamethe original quotstarcraftquot was a fantastic game
one of the top three best rts games i have played
it had great maps and scenerios and great units and species
for those of you who are not familiar with the game the original had too do with three species the terranhumans who have lived upon several planets in a solar system after there space ships crashed many years before stranding thousands of people
the prottos a powerfull race form a planet quotauirquot armed with powerfull physical weapons and devastating phsycic weapons
and finally the zerg
a vicious race controlled by a center mastermind know as the quotovermindquot who travel across the universe incorpirating every worthy race into there species or destroying themnow in the expansion quotbrood warquot  the overmind is dead and kerriganan infested terran has become ruler over most of the zergbrood war has plenty of new stuff
three new campaings
three new terrain typesice world desert twilight world and seven new units
the new untis are the followingzerglurker
the hydralisk from the original can now evolve even further to become a quotlurkerquot
these frightfull creatures burrow under the ground and attack by sending out long spiked tentacle out of the ground at any nearby enemy
these are often best used in pairs or threesor more
though the sunken colonybuildinf from original does basicly the same thing the lurker is hidden from units who are not ditectors and can run away if the going gets rough
only problem is that it has no above ground defensedevourer
in the original the air unit quotmutaliskquot could evolve further into a quotguardianquot
these flying hulks could fire balls of acid and chemicals at untis on the ground and could do great damage in numbers
the only problem was that they could not attack air units
not the mutalisk can also evolve into the devourer
they fire clumps of acid spores at enemy air units
these spores would upon inpact burst off some excess acid which would land on adjecant opponents
they would stick too there targets and eventouly eat through the hull of the ships
ofcourse these airborne juggernauts cant attack ground unitsterranmedic
in the original queensand in this one could infect enemy units with a parasite
these parasites would allow that playerthe zerg player to see what the infected unit would see as if it was his own own unit
once the parasite was detected there was no way to remove it except by killing the infected unit
also attacks on terran unit would never heal
now with the medic parasites acid spores stasic fields and other harmfull item can be removed from untis with restoration and units can be healed
medic can also blind detectorsunits who can see ivisibleburrowed units so as they can not see hidden units
i reccomend that medics be sent out along with almost every group of soldiers
they can be a big helpvalkarye
these ships fire misslealot of missles at enemy air units
one can be dangerous but a group of them can be devastating to enemy fleetsprotossdark templarthe dark templar are indeed powerfull units
they move swiftly and attack vicously and with extreme speed and on top of that they are permenately cloaked
though they dont have the spells that templar have they are very powerfull units however they can like the templar join together to become a dark archondark archonthese swirling red lookalikes to the archons do not have an acual attack but they do have powerfull spells like mindlink which converts enemy unit to your sidetry converting a scv so you can make terran units and building
 or mealstrom which traps units in a temporary field or they can turn an enemys own energy agains them to destroy enemies instantlycorsairthese new air units are fast is a valuble adition to the fleet
aswhell as being able to attack it can create a cloud which protects air units from attack from below
this can be very valuble in air raidswhell there you have it  star craft expansion brood war
if you have the original than you should buy this
if your new to starcraft than buy bothor but the battle chest
you were be dissapointed
did you find this review help full
if so please votewhen you play starcraft you step into a whole new realm of reality
it isnt anything like warcraft it is twice as good
the goal of htis game is basically to knock out the computer opponent
there are  races to choose from terran human protoss highteck alien and zerg primitave alien
all  are unique in their own way with the terran you can get tanks that destroy anything the can find it is  great
there is also the multiplayer option which allows you to play on a lan or you can play on battlenet which is a lot of fun
buy starcraft you should buy it even if its  the game is worth every penny and you are guarnteed to have funthis game is sweet because you can choose from three different story modes terran zerg and protoss
and also what is cool about this game is that it is an expansion pack
i dont knowget haow to play mutiplayer on this game but everyone else pry does
you can also make your own place
if only they made one of these for gcpsor xbox
if you know how to play warcraft you know how to play this game
all the people are different in this game and which fate will you choosestarcraft iswas definately a ground breaker
even now late  it is still in the  ten games
this package contains the original and expansion pack
you also get the strategy guides in the box
i find this a really  good value
and contrary to all criticism received this isnt just  warcraft in space its completely unique
this is just a great deal very  good valuestarcraft
also known as hours of funit has a cool name
one of the first strategy game
battlenet to play agasint other people
protoss terren zergdo yuo have this gameyou should                                           starcraft is an old game for the computer
but even tho it is still a very good game
u play as three different civilizations terran humans
protoss advanced aliens that rely on technology heavily
and zerg aliens that are completly biological and use absolutly no robots at all
u play in the campaign mode and go along with the story which is not bad by the way
however it gets really hard in the last mission of the regular starcraft where u have to destroy the overmind of the zerg
then in brood war the expansion set the last mission is almost impossible
the first time to beat it took me about  hours on that mission alone
starcraft is a really hard game and involves deep strategic thinking in order to win
overall it is a great gamei remember playing this game years ago when i was  years old and having the hardest time in the world beating the first  single player missions
i finally gave up and started using cheats like power overwhelming to blaze through the missions
the last few protoss missions in the original i proclaimed impossible without cheats because none of my ten year old friends at the time could beat it as well
however i still found the game addicting and played for hours with my friends via connected modemsnow  years later starcraft  is coming out so i decided it was time to build a whole new i computer to replace my  year old pentium  rig
i also picked this game up to try and beat it again without cheats but also to refresh my memory of the story
amazingly however i somehow have become good enough that i managed to complete the whole game
honestly it felt like a real accomplishment and i was very happy about it despite knowing in the back of my head the ridiculousness of my happinessthe gameplay of course has aged quite a bit it isnt as tactical as recent rts games like empire total war
but i cannot deny how much fun the simple mechanics are
i found myself playing for hours on end skipping entire meals like dinner on weekdays or lunch on sundays
it is also a game that i found myself constantly thinking about even at work which to me is the mark of a classic
there are few things in video games as satisfying using psionic storm on group of mutalisks or the sound of a siege tank blasting incoming zerglingsthe way the story is told is cute with transmissions from the main characters and a few cg scenes
it is cute because back in the day the starcraft narrative and delivery of that narrative was nothing short of groundbreaking of course now it seems crude and simplistic
for me however nostalgia overcomes those problemsin the end starcraft battlechest at  dollars is a great value with over  hours of gameplay for singleplayer alone
i only played through the single player because i was scared of getting absolutely and completely owned on battlenet which was my experience when i was  my opponent would laugh uncontrollably at the sight of my meager base and unitsif you played and liked starcraft before then this package is essential for your collection and will refresh your understanding of the incredible story in time for sc
if you like rts games already then you should try this game out it is incredibly fun and can actually be very deep strategically if you chose it to be
people whos first video game experiences were fps games on their xbox  might not enjoy it still it never hurts to try new thingsmy life for auirim reviewing this game on behalf of my husband
ive played it and while i have enjoyed it im not nearly as diehard about it as he is
ill take diablo ii thank you very muchin our house we have a thing called computer night about once a month
on a friday night my husband fatherinlaw and  other males from church get together and hook up all their computers to a lan
this is the game that they spend hours playing
it usually starts at around  or  and the house is not returned to its normal state until roughly amit usually begins with a lot of talking smack about whos gonna win and who lost the last time and what race they are going to be
oh and lets not forget about who is on what team
 vs  of courseafter about a  hour battle and the winning team is crowned they get up from their machines and have a briefing
this is my favorite part to watch due to sheer fascination
the begin by explaining to each other how they saw the battle progressing what things worked for them and what didnt and then how they are might try to avoid the same obstacles the next gamethen they return to their computers the smack talking resumes and it all begins again
its just hilarious
and let me tell you they get rowdy
especially while they play with headphones on since its late and they dont want to infringe on the other playersif this is any indication of the fun that they have while playing this game its only because the game is that goodso your considering buying starcraft aye
well if you have not heard of this game all i have to say is you poor deprived human being
any gamer on the face of the earth knows about this game and what it did to change the way they think about playing games on a computer game
yes i have heard it all the people who rally themselves against games such as this
saying that you do nothing but build build build build really fast
then fight fight fight kill kill kill
well if you excuse my impertinence your wrong
this game teaches you how to adapt to the three different species
zerg terran and protoss
it is like the ultimate in adaptive combat
i have never come up with fighting tactics in any other game except one faster than in this game
it is made by blizzard those good people who made warcraft and warcraft ii tides of darkness
so find this game
buy it and enjoy it for the love of all that is good and pure
enjoy this game
it should be a definite buy and must have and no gamers collection would ever truly be complete without iti played this game when it first came out but never owned it and never played the expansion pack
man was i missing out
for the price this was selling at this is the ultimate deal
not only do you get the game and the expansion but you get detailed strategy books for both gamesthe graphics are still pretty solid after all these years and the music and sound affects are awesome hey
this is blizzard
what did i expect
the story is very intriguing and quite surprising at the end
very well put together
and each unit for each race is different as are the buildings
with most rts games each faction has different units but they are usually only different in design and name
they do the same thing the other factions units do
but in starcraft you really need to know what units do to succeed
for the zerg they have hydralisks that when seperate are pretty weak but when you group them up and have them attack one target at a time they are very strong and a group of  or  can wipe out an army or buildings very quickly
very unique units and buildingsas with every blizzard game the story is excellent with you controlling all  races over  missions
the eaxpansion pack also lets you play all  races over another missions for a total of  missions
not too bad for any game and the expansion is clearly one of the best there ever has been
the cutscenes add to the story and a pretty good graphically and great musically
a total joy to play
the only downside to the game is playing against another live person
i played this game against a friend of mine at least  times and we had  ties and i won once
the crystals and vespene gas run out before a winner could be decided
other than that this is an awesome game even today and with this package deal this is an excellent buy
happy gamingive been a gamer for a long time and ive played my share of strategy games
i still keep comming back to starcraft for more
three perfectly balanced and yet very different races battle it out
theres not too much micromanagement to kill you but enough for you to feel a part of the race youre playing
i love to play the extra scenerios that they created for one time battles
you can modify them or even create your own from scratch
i just wish they had a random map maker
it would be easier then
you can however go online to blizzard and download tons of scenerios that other gamers made
while the graphics arent state of the art anymore they still are pretty nice
this game allows for both a strategic approach or the full rush type of battle
you have both land and air units and you harvest two types of materials vespene gas  minerals to build your structures and units
the campaigns are nice but after beating them twice i now just prefer to mix it up with the single scenerios
this is a must have of any strategy gamer who hasent yet tried it
have funthis game is a classic
it got me through middle school
however at this date and time i would recommend just preorderingstarcraft ii wings of liberty
blue skiesbillythere is no doubt in my mind that starcraft was blizzards finest game to date
there are some that would say diablo  but in my humble opinion diablo  just didnt have the replay value of starcraftif you dont already know starcraft is a rts game that features three different races the terrans the zerg and the protoss
each has very different strategies that can be used to defeat the other
i personally prefer the terrans
the terrans are the most fun to play but i believe the terrans are also the toughest and maybe the most rewarding to play
the protoss are hard to play also
i dont like to play the zerg because they are too easy to play and it is too easy to win a multiplayer game withall in all get the battlechest
it comes with both strategy books which is nice in case you get stuck on any of the missionsas for multiplayer starcraft is really great if you have a few family members who play also
what i mean to say is is that if your computer is part of a lan like mine is youll experiance starcraft multiplayer lag free like it was meant to be played
why play on battlenets subpar servers
enjoyi have bought this game before and returned it both times i paid  for the game while they were on sale
make no mistake this game and warcraft iii are the best strategy games that i have played
command and conquer general just seemed cliche
who doesnt want to have a variety of characters to play with
first time i rated this game as a one star because i couldnt play on my mac
however mac probably updated the compatibility
i am using snow leopard mac os x  as of today
even playing without volume on my windows would be a good idea tooi had this game back in  i played it so much that my dad broke the cd along with warcraft  telling me that i cant play any games from now on
so i recently bought starcraft battle chest secretly my dad doesnt know that i have this game again
this game is so good because the system requirements are so low that i can turn off the game without turning off the whole computer
my dad leaves on the pc the whole time so i have to leave it on all the time
if i turn off the whole computer he might suspect that i have been playing a computer game
i always play when he goes to some place until i hear a keychain or a footstep
i probably disconnect off the game more than any other players on the planet
this is not about the game but i just wanted to share it with you every game that i own my dad doesnt know that i have
now im going to talk about the game
the requirements are no problem unless you havent bought a new computer since  the gameplay is great and the graphics and sounds are good
the best part of all is the battlenet
you can play  vs  comp stomp when you are in a hurry and play  vs  experts only when you have nothing to do
it is very addictive to play with others online and it it keep you entertained for hours everyday
if you want wins play lots of comp stomp but it will not raise your skill as much as in expert games
i assure you that this game will keep you entertained
this is one my favorite rts of all time and i highly recommend this game just as much as i recommen warcraft  and i love thes games its the best of the star craft collection you have got  to buy this game if its going to be a game get the one forsure its the best star craft games if you go to the starcraft web site its more expensive and if you get it seperately more money you will have to pay will thinkswhen starcraft came out there was no game like it and still today there is no game like it
it is a lot of fun
i just wish they would do an hd remake of the d graphics
as the title states this is my favorite game of all timewhy story is amazing
the campaign is challenging and fun
also dark and rewarding units in all races are different and fun
each race has cool strategies that are different than the others great online for the time
its old now but back when it came out it was awesome endless fun from online mapsbuyyou will come to understand that video games are an artform when you start playing starcraft
first youll find a story which masterfully weaves between  different races in grand interstellar conflict with a cast of hundreds
this story comes to you in movies in briefings and in the game itself such that you actually play the story and react against it or drive it forward
ive played this game from start to finish  times now just to relive the amazing talebut starcraft is a strategy game and its strategy is so deep you could spend years exploring it and people have been playing this game for years
the three different races play in different styles
the zerg quotgrowquot their bases and attack in overwhelming numbers winning thru overkill
the noble protoss conjure their buildings out of thin air and their armies are often small very tough and invisible
the terrans are the happy medium with a little bit of everythingalso of note are the wonderful graphics still potent after  years and of course that biting blizzard humor which shows itself in the peculiar comments that your soldiers make
there is so much polish and shine on this game its no wonder it was a best seller for years and yearsthis package includes the orginal game starcraft and its rather weak expansion pack brood war
all the lavish praise i gave above was for starcraft but if you want to save some money you can probably do without brood war as it only includes about  new units which hardly changes the way the game plays
get it if you starve for the extra story that it providesyou can afford this
this is the best game there is when it comes to actionstrategy
there simply isnt an alternative
red alert  is pretty close to this one but it isnt as balanced for multiplayer gaming
blizzard the creator used a very long time creating this game trying to make it work to the fullest
did they achiece their goal
yes they did
buy it to yourself or somebody you love
mark my words you will not regret itgreat soundtrack different for all racesthe sound effects in the game are great and are best on huge stereos
wake your neighbours and scare their dog with a zerg roaringplay as the overwhelming zerg powerful humans or cunning protossget swallowed by a great storyif you are tired of the game itself try out the mission creator create missions for your friends with you giving the mission briefinghave lots of  coke ready because you are going to be sitting on that chair for a long timewarning may lead to antisocial behaviourbrush your teeth after all the coke consumptionis product is great
it came in on time and everything was exactly as described in the description
thanks againi bought this game about a year ago and i still play it all the time
it has provided thousands and thousands of hours of fun thanks to blizzards battlenet where users can create their own scenarios which make the possibilities endless
you get starcraft starcraft expansion and strategy guides for both
this is a great deal and i would recommend it to any strategy game fani own the new warcraft iii series from blizzard and other true d games like emperor battle for dune from westwoodea games
i say this because some of the older rts games like westwoods command and conquer series dune  blizzards own warcraft ii and other games date badly
you can see this in terms of the control problems blocky graphics clunky path finding and if you play online nearly nonexistent fan basestarcraft and the expansion broodwar still generate a daily complement of  players online at any one time playing in thousands of games
im sure the newest games like warcraft iii and diablo ii is providing the lions share of overall traffic on blizzards server farms
still starcraft is a game going on six years of relatively strong viability
the reasons why are simplefirst the game has nearly flawless control
this is significant since many computer users only work with a mouse and keyboard
second as an rts real time strategy game the game has been patched to keep up a finely tuned balance between forces
due to strong after purchase support the smallest bugs have been rooted out of the game in subsequent game patches
third the game has quotmuchoquot replayability
ive played single missions over and over just to try the different strategies
the diversity of units is done so well that many strategies exist in multiplayer as well
fourth due to the easy to work game editor there are many different games produced by the players
some are just battle and others are detailed rpg style games while still others reinvent the term quotall out warquotblizzard has a different philosophy than most gaming companies
they continue to work on a game until they believe it is a first class product
they provide added value like a game editor that you can use to create better missions than the professional ones created in the game
not to mention the server network battle net that allows game owners with simple internet connections to login and play online with up to  players for no additional charge
yes thats right ultima and everquest players its still totally free to play onlinethe last thing to consider is the original starcraft and its expansion set broodwar are an incredible bargain at less than twenty bucks for both
add to that that they throw in both of the expensive guide books and game newbies can start playing for dirt
moreover just between you me and the lamppost deep down in some secret cavern inside blizzards game complex they are working on starcraft ii
if you have the stamina or the cheat codes to beat warcraft iii on its highest setting and last mission you get an extended ending sequence
the extension shows a brief detail of d starcraft characters in a short battle sequenceblizzard has not announced this game officially and refuses to confirm or deny they will produce it
i believe this all has to do with continued sales of starcraft as it exists today
a game with a strong following and decent enough sales to give them time to create a d followup that wont disappoint
warcraft ii had a lot of ai and path finding problems that starcraft does not have
warcraft iii was necessary to revive that series
starcraft does not have those problems so the challenge will be to make a new game that is much richer and more interesting in its game play
until that time comes you wont be disappointed playing the originalthis is still one of the best rts games ever
a must have for any video game junky when you just need some good old school funive been playing this game for  years single playermultiplayerlan as  well as bnet and it still continues to thrill me the way it did when i  first ripped it out of its box
buy this game
trust mein my time ive played a number of games a big number and some have been good while some have been bad
and heres one of the good ones the really good ones
the best strategy game ever made in fact im convinced there will never be one better not even warcraft iiii couldnt really review this really read someone elses im just another voice saying that its good nothing i say will change how people feel about this game
buy it no questions even if you dont like games go read all the other  star reviews yes all  of them now go get itstarcraft is the classical example of a real time strategy game
its been around for ever  ive been playing starcraft since   but even though the graphics are sad by todays standards the game is awfully goodthere are hundreds of good reviews on the internet and so rather than reiterating their collective points of view i will say this to complement themif you have never played this game you need to play it if only to understand what kept millions of gamers and probably half the population of south korea sleepdeprived for yearsi would go as far as to argue that starcraft is primarily responsible for global warming  think of all the coal we burned to generate the energy required to power all those computers and crt monitors and light bulbs and the heat produced by them
as a generation of gamers stayed up all night fighting invasions and plotting fiendish countermoves instead of reducing their electricity consumption by turning off their pcs and going to sleepfor those of you who havent played for a while the battle chest is a good way to relive the memories of those happy days of bygone years
it works on win  but note that the mac version of the game is not compatible with os x lion lion dropped rosetta which allowed programs from the powerpc days to run on intelbased macsbut then i dont remember many mac users in the s playing starcraft
when me and my buddies were happily gaming on our pcs they were usually doing productive artsy things on their macs which is probably why they now zip past me in their sl amgsthis has always been a great game i got a copy in early  and loved it
the brood war expansion pack just adds to is worth the fact that this futuristic rts game is in a rather cheap bundle only improves a great game from a great companythis game is so addicting it should be called starcrack
this is not an endorsement for the illicit use of drugs
im just saying it could be a problemthe learning curve is steep but the tutorials are excellent
even i was able to catch onits a complex strategy game
im trying to figure out how to use the science vessel
it isnt easy and im hoping it isnt going to get stupid difficultive found that slowing down the games time clock will give me more time to manage the campaignsthe installation froze but surprisingly i was able to call tech support and talk to a person
i downloaded the installation program and had no issues
you may have an issue with this if you have a slow connection or if you dont have internetanother surprise was that this old old game is able to use my dual processor capability
it is running smooth on my desktop under xp
i can put my system to sleep and bring it out of standby without any issues
its great that blizzard has continually upgraded this software so that it has not become datedits a great game
i wish god would give us ten more years that we already have to play games but unfortunately this isnt happening
judicial use of time is key to being able to enjoy this game
it is very easy to miss a meeting and let the whole evening pass just because this game has mesmerized me
be careful with thati bought the games seperate but it was worth it
i love starcraft
i love all the talking and the introsmeetings at the beginning of each mission
my other fave part is blowing up the bases
i love the walking around killing people thing while my father likes the base building thing
im  and violence makes this game better
my father and i are strategy game addicts
we have them all both starcrafts both dark reigns a bridge too far age of empires ceasar  tiberian sun command and conquer and probably more then that
i love these game my fave side is the humans
my fave character was whats her name the lady who turns into a alien and takes over the zerg well buy this cuz you get a guide tooi got starcraft buy looking at it thought it was interesting and bought it
its been one of my favorite games ever a major rival is perfect darkmy favorite spiecies is the zerg
i like their massproduction way of battle
the terrans are human and my second favorite
they have fairlyskilled units at a fair price
the protoss are hard to use for me mostly because i go overbord with production of their highly priced units
the battlefields are awsome the missions intereseting and hard and the game is very addictive
were it not you would fall asleep you could play nonstop i had to eat
the game is a great bargiani was never big into rts games my friend let me borrow cc i thought it was interesting but it didnt really sell me
i bought this out of all the hype and after enjoying cc it blew my mine this game is old in my bookbut the textures and graphics still hold up
the box is a bit overkill i just want the disc and the code i could care less about the strategy guide and free wow passesstarcraft to koreans is baseball to americans
they have  television show dedicated to it
they showere their sc champions with moneys and fame
those that deserve a shout are slayersboxer
red nada
i luv etc etc
those who only remember the game from six years ago when it was the fabulous fad are surprised to hear about its popularity today
its ginormous reputation and following laced over the world
people are bred for this game
people work at their game for years eight hours a day
its nothing like ive ever seen
ive never heard of a game so perfectly aged with time
its followings build every year
every year its the dominant pick of the wcg
and every year its the big news of the event
blizzard is terrified to make another
they are terrified at the expectations of a sequel
its engine cannot be changed cannot be supplemented it is called as the perfect user interface
the speeds that the average pro gamer attain is fluid throughout and at unreal speeds apm
a tribute and truth to the impossibly reliable compatibility with computers
its as if the desktop computer was made for sc
beware
jeffjust gotta post some lovethis game is the king of real time strategy games even stillquick run down
three races terran future humans zerg think the movie aliens protoss technologicly advanced race with lots of psionic powers though think of the movie predator can stealth use plasma cannons they stronger bigger etc
the three races are locked in a struggle for various reasons as each race has multiple factions running amuck causing problems you get to team up with key characters fromeach race to help further there goals through single player then once your got the basics down jump on  and wreck some player face and earn some ratingalso has a very good map editor so there is thousands of player made maps when you feel less competitive these come in forms of rpgs and others some of my favorites were recreation of older games like smash tvif your looking into played starcraft  id recommend picking this up for a quick refresher as thend one will contain all the same races though the units are a bit different or entirely newthis game is without a doubt one of the best games ever made and what a deal at  for the whole set
this games single player is very enjoyable and youll also enjoy countless hours of free online play provided you have a decent internet connectionblizzards free online gaming service is fantastic
simple and easy to use and it has everything from competitive vsing as well as team games of sizes anywhere from vs to vs massive way free for alls and more
i really enjoy playing this online with my friendsif you like real time strategy games this is a must have
id also like to say that of all the games ive played so far by this company ive never been disappointed
theyre all high quality in my opinion and starcraft is certainly no exceptionstarcraft is arguably one of the best real time strategy games ever made
it combines amazing game play in depth unit characteristics an amazing story and fun online play all into one outstanding gamein starcraft there are three races the noble protoss the vicious zerg and unstable terrans which wage ware against each other in an epic struggle for survival
each race has their own type of units which do not correspond to units from any of the other race and each race has their own strengths and weaknessthe game play of starcraft is easy to understand and fun to play
it has a learning curve of about  minutes and offers quick aid for making game winning strategies
the game also offers jaw dropping cinematic sequences in game cut scenes and funny unit quotes which complement the games story that is full of twists and turnsstarcraft is the game that set the standard of excellency for all rts games that preceded it
it is a must own for all strategy game lovers or those who love playing war gamesblizzard probably the most succesful gaming company out right now released a game called star craft
the game features  races terran protoss and zerg each with their own abilities and units
the reason  this game is so fun to play and to deal with is the complete differences  that each race has
in war both races were pretty much a like but in sc  amp bw each race is so different that all the time even for the last   years strategies keep coming up all over the placethe story line is  very well made could have been a novel or a movie if they had chosen to do  so
the movies are of course the best
blizzard is well known for the  great quality and enjoyment of their entriguing cinematicsif you do  not already own this game i incredibly suggest that you go buy it  immediatelythis game is phenominal to say the least
it is very fun and was the first rts game ive ever played once a friend introduced me to it
it is so much fun to play and very addicting
the only reason i sold it is because not many people play online and the ones that do will take you out in a heartbeat and the single player missions go by pretty fast
this game would be incredibly fun to play at a lan party but i never went to one yetive been playing this game since  when the original came out and ive always and still do love it and play it
great campaign great custom games and great online play
endless entertainment
i highly recommend this game especially the battle chest because it gives you strategy guides to both the original and the expansion as well as bonus catalogues and strategy pamphletsi thought that this game was really fun
i know that this is supposedly the best rts game ever
personally i think that age of empires is a better game than starcraft but after aoe this is probably the best rts game ever
i really love how challenging the campaigns are
i mean i beat um but they were hardyou will never be able to play another realtimestrategy game again i couldnt
i have never played any other game as much or as long as i have played this one
cant wait for part  later this yearstarcraft battle chest by blizzard entertainment includes complete versions of starcraft and  its expansion pack brood war
the box set also includes a strategy guide for both the original game and the expansion pack
i would say this is a great classic game but what it is is epic
still as fun today as it was the day it was released
i play starcraft ii now yet still go back and play the original as there is an active online community via battlenetthis real time strategy games has three races that though diverse are well balanced
blizzard made sure the game was challenging and fast paced
whether playing the single player campaign game or against live players you will have to pay attention or be over whelmed
it is a game you will not want to stop playing
highly recommendedblizzard is one of those companies which toil away quietly only to release masterpiece after masterpiece
real time strategy wasnt invented by blizzard instead they looked at what others had done and made  improvements the end result was warcraft which was followed by the hugely  successful starcraft in  then the followup brood war in  they  have been assembled here in something called a battlechest which is  actually just a bigger box but battlechest sounds better
they also  include the strategy guides for both games making it an excellent value  for the money given how routinely over priced strategy guides arestarcraft gives the player command of  races the terrans who are allied  in a sort of confederacy and boils down to red necks in space the zerg a  race of xenomorphs created by an ancient race known as the xelnaga
the  zerg are the ultimate predator and hyperevolutionary beings finally we  have the protoss a race of psionic and technological masters but were  also created by the xelnaga
each race has  missions that the player  must complete enabling them to win as each race while a larger story  unfoldsthe zerg are spreading across the galaxy trying to find the  next stage of their evolution in this case its the humans whom they plan  to absorb in order to gain psionics
the protoss aware of the zerg  overmind and his plans to infest the human colonies dispatch one of the  greatest warrior templarstassadar to deal with the threat
but when he  discovers that the humans have potential he refuses to incinerate the  infested planets
the terrans meanwhile are in the midst of the revolution  as governor mensk intends on becoming emperor mensk by leading a renegade  faction of humans known as the sons of korhol
the game also introduces a  host of unforgettable characters like tassadar fenix james raynor and  sarah kerriganwhile graphics may begin to appear a little dated  they are well detailed and colorful even though the game does not have any  d support
what this also means is that they game will run on slower  machines like pentium s
it has both internet and network support and  both starcraft and broodwar include a native campaign editor that enables  creative players to design their own missions to share with friends
both  the sound and the music are first rate with one of the more enjoyable  aspects of the game being the different oneliners delivered by the  different characters and vehicles whenever you click on them multiple  times
especially good are the standard terran marine the science vessel  and the dropshipgame play however is second to none in the rts  arena
all three of the races are exceptionally well balanced between each  other though the humans are by far the most versatile and solid
the zerg  regenerate damage and can be built quickly but arent as tough as the  humans so they make up for it in greater numbers
the protoss are the  toughest of the three races but their units also take the longest to build  and cannot be repaired if damaged
and one of the more fun aspects of  broodwar is using prostoss dark templars to mind control enemy units such  as the terran scv or zerg gatherer with it you can then build and control  all of the terran or zerg units as wellstarcraft delivers it all  terrific story unsurpassed game play great and often funny cg full motion  video and replayability
no two missions are alike and range from  capture search and destroy to all out warfare that will take hours to  complete
end missions are inhumanly tough forcing the player to really  think about what units he should build and how he should use them
the game  rewards success with more missions especially considering that between the  two there are well over one hundred multiplayer maps contained on the  disks as well
however as with all internet multiplayer games beware of  dirty filthy stinking rotten cheatersstraight up this is the best  game within its class outmatching even command amp conquer who really  created the genre in the first place
starcrafts sense of humor epic  story and scale coupled with blizzards uncompromising production values  make for a truly memorable game one that delivers hours of play in a well  thought out universe
this game is pure funwhats not to love about this game 
great game at a great price a must if your into war games and we all love a good fight this game still sets the standard for rts games
it was ground breaking when it was released and remains one of the most current games being playedapparantly this game is eaisly compatable with vista although i can not verify this myselfif your an rts fan you have to pick up this game if you have never played itif by chance youre reading this and youve never played starcraft before just go ahead and skip reading this and buy it
you wont be disappointedif youre thinking about buying it for someone else go  ahead and buy it ive given three battle chests as gifts and it was a hit  every time for both kids and adults even to those who hadnt played this  kind of game beforethe battle chest is definitely the way to go as  youll save money over buying it and brood war separately and get the strat  guides for free and to be honest i dont think the guides are worth  having unless youre completely clueless about how to beat the game and  there is information in the strat guides that is blatantly wrong as  wellive been playing rts games since  and in my opinion this is  the best one ever made
no one has made one thats as fun has as gripping  a storyline and artwork or depth and replayability of gameplay
its a  work of genius
ive had it for two years and i still play it at least a  couple of times a week
theres even one mission left that i havent  managed to conquer without cheating so the challenge is definitely  therewhat you have to understand about starcraft is that its not meant  to be a cuttingedge featureheavy supergame where you can customize the  behavior of your units and give them complex orders
its meant to be more  of a strategy game like realtime chess and in this it succeeds  brilliantly
it shares the quality of chess in that there are a limited  number of units with straightforward abilities but there are an infinite  number of things and strategies that you can do with them
to this day  players are still inventing new strategies for these units and racesthe  artificial intelligence and pathfinding of the game is the best ive ever  seen
no rts game has perfect ai or pathfinding units getting lost or  tangled up on each other or the terrain but starcrafts is by far better  than any others out there
the computer will flatten you time and again  unless youre playing competentlymultiplayer is a complete blast and  more options are offered than any other rts game
you can play team games  where you and your allies are actually controlling the same units against  the computer or others in addition to a wide range of variations like  capture the flag etcblizzards battlenet service is free and at any  time of day there are literally thousands of people playing
internet play  is smooth
ive played friends both nationally and internationally with bad  connections and lowend computers and it runs solidly even with the  additional traffic of voice chat like roger wilco over kblizzards  continuing support for the game is also excellent
they release a new map  for the game every friday like clockwork so there are over a hundred new  welldesigned maps available for download and replayin summary just a  solid solid completely fun game
you cant possibly go wrong by picking  up a copyim a pretty big video game fan
i usually get the hit games kind of late because i wont pay full price for them but starcraft is worth every penny ive spent
this game is the most addictive game ive ever played
there are so many things that make this game great and there are really no serious knocks that can be thrown at itthe story line to starcraft is pretty simple
you can pick from three different races terran zerg and protoss
in the stroyline they all have different goals they want to achieve
the terrans are the humans in the game
they have there pros and cons
they have medium range units that are pretty cheap to build and are all around pretty effective
the zerg are the buglike species
they have cheap and quick units
the protoss are the alien species of the group
they have expensive but very powerful unitssingle player mode is pretty fun
the missions arent really all that bad
the story is decent and i enjoyed playing it all the way through
the gem to this game is the multiplayer optionsif you get this game you definetly want to get on the internet and play on battlenet
thats what makes the game so addictive
its a great game but it gets even better when you can sign on and play against millions of other players
you can also get a hold of crazy maps on battlenet which add new and fun life to the game
we have a  port hub at home and this is are favorite multiplayer game to play
like the guy in the review before me said you really need to watch the clock when you get on battlenet because you will lose track of time
i will get so into this game ill stop for food and the bathroom
the rest of the time you are so engrossed in this awesome gamethis is one of the best games ive ever played
i have no real flaws with the game that are even worth bringing up
if you want a fun game to play then pick this one up and enjoyi remember  years ago when i stumbled onto the starcraft battle chest at electronics boutique
i was so filled with joy that i found it for my macintosh computer  i heard many good reviews of the game
little did i know that it would ensnare my lifeas soon as i got home i opened the box and installed both starcraft and brood war
never before and since have i found a real time strategy game with the same combination of storyline and gaming feel no not even warcraft iii
the single player storyline holds onto your attention as it seamlessly slips from one mission to the next from one race to the next
the actual game play is awesome
the three races are diverse and balanced very well
no units stick out as being undefeatable
each race allows for many options in battle strategiesbut two things make this game playable for years  battlenet and the editor
i remember when i was in th grade and talked all my friends into buying starcraft
we would come home after school and play from  until  or   in the end we would just call each other and say craft
and the other person would answer either yes or no and then we would proceed to play if yes was said
then as the creative juices start to flow the editor is available to create entire campaigns or just one map
it adds to the longetivity of this gameindeed starcraft is a great game
from story line to playability this game has it all
i totally suggest it to anyone who wants a game that will provide you with hours and hours of gameplaystarcraft is awsome
and addicting
and this game is definitly old school sytle
lots of funthe battle chest is a great way to get both starcraft and its expansion broodwar together the make one of the best combat  strategy games
if you dont own starcraft buy the battle chest and get all the extras
they will help you enjoy the game fully
if you already own starcraft unless you really want the two strategy guides just buy the expansion pack broodwar instead
starcraft really needs to be played with the expansion it adds more depth to both the game and tactics with new missions and new units
the basic game play is pretty easy to pick up and if you play the single player missions in order youll quickly learn the strengths and weaknesses of each troop type
then the fun really begins when you battle against real opponents across the internet
after you have played the single player missions youll have your favorite race either terran protos or zerg
youll come up with your own tactics on how to deal with your opponents there is a huge online community out there defending the honor of each respective race
buy the game and come play
this game came out back in  and it is still being played now
few games can say they have that lasting appeal
the battle chest is  value for moneyyep as the title goes the game is like drugs to kids and teenagers
just like to warn parents and potential buyersive played it the second year after it came out stopped and went back
clan leader of  clans and second rated general to the leader of  clans so im pretty sure i know this game quite a bit
oh yeah i would say the rating is  not  as there are flaws even though insignificanteven though the graphics arent super it is still great and i wouldnt want to change it maybe just add a little more detail to each craft and individualthe game play is very nice
i suggest practice in single player for a short period say a week an hour a day
than you must i emphasise on must start playing it online with other player this is what makes the game worth while
playing by yourself with cheats can be fun but also very boring later on
this is what makes the game great
i suggest getting  or so broadband dsl why
if you have k internet you will usually lag shown by the red bars next to your snscreen name
if you lag in a game the creator will very likely bootban you
this is where youll get stuck playing by yourself again
please take note having k doesnt necessarily mean youll lag so chear up
it just means youll lag more of the time than those with fast dslcable internet
having super fast internet also doesnt mean youll never lag but youll lag rarely depends on server
multiplayer player is great because you can fight other players fight with a friend or by yourself against computers or have a third whole new option which makes this game excellent called uh oh i forgot havent played in  years
ums used map setting
this is where you can play maps made by ordinary people just like you to play
they can be totally different from the melee counterpart
rpg and such
so when youre bored of melee go to ums and vice versa
there are many options but you find out for yourself im not your momthe type of class you can get is nice as well
terran protoss and zergterrangreat defense medium build time requires more strategy than usual to play
as youll usually see terrans are used regularly in melee vs
tanks flying buildings vultures with mines and battlecruisers are some of the strategies youll see used against youzergfast build between mixes of defense and offense
you must use the swarm to your advantageprotossbest in offense
slowest building time more powerful men howeverthere are many other details into it but i wont spoil it for the new peoples to itplease remember limit yourself to this game
its very very time consuming
its the kind of game where you start playing at  and the next minute you look at the clock 
an hour or two on a free day
take my word dont waste your life too much with this gamei dont need to say how great of a game starcraft is you know it isbut if you have windows  be careful with this purchase
windows  since the task bar can only be removed through disabling explorer screws up the colorsyou may want to invest in the power needed to play starcraft  if youre using ok listen up
this is one of the best games ever made
there are  races terran human protoss advanced alien zerg sacrifical alien
you choose your race and battle in an area where you will find crystals and gas
you must build up your army and fight to the death
it has great online play the best of the best
if you like this game i suggest you try warcraftwhat a great game
ive owned starcraft since the st one and got this for a new computer so i could have all  love them all
all  are a ton of fun to play no matter what
this game will never get oldnow that blizzard has announced that it is developing starcraft  this is a great time to go back and pick up this classic realtime strategy game
its pretty much accepted amongst serious rts enthusiasts that starcraft is the gold standard of the genre
as many other reviewers have mentioned this game is polished incredibly well balanced and a lot of fun to play
both the singleplayer and multiplayer features are enjoyable pretty amazing that you can still get games on battlenet considering that this is product is ten years old and blizzard still provides patch support for the game
the included strategy guides are rather small unfortunately and are difficult to read but they arent particularly good anyway so its no big loss to not read themwhat makes this game so great
this game doesnt have the flashy graphics of modern games but thats not an issue since the units are distinctive and possess clean crisp animations
the unit count for each faction is less than most rtses  but every unit this is no exaggeration has a distinctive role at every phase of the game
no unit is obsolete in the endgame not even the lowly zergling
as a result this game makes you seriously think about what kind of army you want to field and how you use it in combat
the mix between battle tactics micro base management macro and strategy is unlike that in any other gameincidentally this game is still incredibly popular in south korea with the top professional players earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per year
it is primarily due to the enthusiasm of the koreans that this game has had its amazing longevity
not only has their support kept this game on the international gaming stage but has allowed professional players to develop new and innovative strategies
as a result its impossible to ever master this game
theres always something to improve on and better players to compete with  which are both marks of a truly great game
even though casual players will never directly interact with the top professional players the pros keep the game fresh and exciting for everyonethis really is a great time to buy starcraft  the price is reasonable there are still many people who play this game and the community has been revitalized by the announcement of starcraft   long story short if you dont own starcraft and have even a passing interest in strategy games you owe it to yourself to buy this productthis is a great deal
both stratagy guidslots of new maps lots of operating platforms and low requirements make this a great deal
this is my all time favorite game
it is fun both with and without the internet and is verry replayable
i garrente that you will lose sleep because this game is so good
so buy itgood playing
you will not be dissapointed when you buy iti have played hundreds of video games in my life and i have to admit they dont come much better than this game right here
in just about every way this game gets  stars
graphics gameplay story multiplayer special features etcheres what i thought of star craftstar craft brood war part of the battlechest collection for the pc gameplay perhaps the best i have ever played
in this world of the future humans terran have changed and become one large army the confederacy
they are able to explore space have an incredible array of weapons and have explored much of the universe
but on these trips to different planets and such they discover they are not alone in this universe
 other dominant races exist out in space and both of them threaten the terran world as we know it
its time for war and thats where the game beginsthe story has  missions in all and lets you control each race  zerg terran and protoss for  mission per race
each race has strengths weaknesses etc  and dozens of things to build
but first before u can build anything u have to mine minerals and gas
to do this u must build probesscvsdrones
at the beginning of missions u will get a nexuscommand centerhatchery basicly what holds your minerals and gas and makes new gatherers
with the nexuscommand centerhatchery u make probes scvsdrones to gather minerals and gas
once u have enough minerals and gas u can build more complex structures
soldiers air units antiaircraft guns etc  as the game goes on u r faced with how to use your mineralsgas etc  with your soldiers and air units u carry out missions
for example destroying a base or defending a leader surviving for  minutes etc  the thing about star craft is you need to out think your opponant
if the person has antiaircraft guns and more soldiers than you you need to get them into a drop ship and perhaps go to the side of their base drop them off and proceed
there are so many ways of doing things and so many things to build the game really is extremely fun and you can find new ways to do things every time
the more you play the more you will enjoy it
it truly is a neverending game
and once you beat the game its time to take your talent online
get to that later graphics excellent
i have never seen such excellent graphics for this type of game
everything fits perfectly
there is blood after a soldier is killed explosions are very dramatic u can see the sparks as minerals are mined up by cutting scvs
when hurt zerg buildings bleed etc dont get the idea this is gory its really not just little red sparks on the screen when something is injured or killed  everything casts a shadow things can turn invisible etc  its excellent
the worlds you play in our top notch as well
shadows mountains trees animals wandering around etc  it truly works well for this type of game
graphics are top notch here especially for when it was made multiplayer the main reason this game stands out
it is absolutely incredible
you can play against the computer system link and of course go online
when you play online your record is kept so you can try to earn some respect out there
there are clans literally thousands of starcraft players waiting to play   and it really is neat to see some of the strategies people have made the beauty and creativity of a well constructed base etc  you can play with your friends as allies melee capture the flag etc  the possibilities are endless
some people master either the protoss zerg or terran while others use a different race every time
each one has strengths and weaknesses and things you might be able to do better with them then you could with other races
it really is great and for the price i dont think you can find better online entertainment as battlenet is free and the sc battlechest is just  bucks lasting appeal proof that this game is incredible and one of the top  games of all time
it literally was made  years ago and still has  people playing online at any given moment
it is still a bestseller and is just a classic in the world of rts real time strategy and just video games period
i bought this game  months ago and literally play it for hours every dayoverall this is a great game
online the incredible story very creative and well put together the races the graphics the price etc  if you have a pc and are low on  and are looking for not a good but a great game that will last you for many years for all ages  starcraft is for you
note though if going online id recommend having a cable or dsl modem
k is good but high speed internet is just so much better in my opinionspectacular game
just a killer waiting for the second
but a must have for all gamersif you have not purchased the original version youre in luck because you can now get all of the spectacular addons for the same price as the original game
one of the best computer games i have ever played
if you  like warcraft or age of empires youll love starcraft
the aspect that  surprised me the most in this game were the scenario and video segments in  between levels
some of the best computer animated film ive ever seen
definitely worth the price considering how long the game remains fun  original and challengingthere are two things that make this game a living classic that will never die  the community theres a map for thatthe online community has seriously made at least  completely unique mapswant a balanced regular map for competitionswant an imbalanced infinite resource crazy fun mapwant a tower defense map
want  different variations of tower defensethere are even entire ums maps that have evolved into competitive universes of play
hydra zones income d path d desert strike to name a few
just like the real game of starcraft theyve been balanced out over the years and are are own games in their own rightand you can get every one of those maps for free
just connect to a game hosting the map and it sends it to you for nothing
patchesblizzard is still patching this game every once in a while
starcraft is the most balanced rts ever period
its the most played video game in tournaments and is a religion in south koreaeven if you dont care about competitive play patches solved hacksthere was a famous hack that allowed zerg players to get infinite minerals that went on for years
blizzard finally patched it out even after just about everyone in the community was convinced it had went under the radar
there have also been a ton of other hacks that have been patched outseriously stop reading and buystarcraft is one of my favorite games of all time
if you have ever played warcraft or diablo you will love this
even if you havent youll still sit at the computer for hours playing starcraft
now its so cheap you must get it
this battle chest comes with the orriginal game the expansion pack  and primas strategy guides for both
this is an awesome and challenging single player experience and an even better multiplayer game
ill tell you some of the background and why you have to buy this gamefirst the single player is great and hard
there are three races in this game  the terran humans the zerg mutated alien things and the protoss high tech aliens
you start out playing as the terrans then the zerg then protoss
in the expansion pack you first play as protoss then terran then zerg
the single player is a long experience and when you dont want a mission you can just play a skirmish game against the computer
then you can play online no fee required on battlenet
this is where starcraft really shines
its great playing with  other unpredictable humans
you can just play a normal game or you can play fun games that have ironic twists
getting online is easy and freenow its really cheap and you have to buy it
nowas i always say you arent considered a true gamer until youve tried starcraft hl and doom
this game a decade after release is still being played by millions of people
the community is still triving and there are still tournementsbuy it
itll be  that go a very very long wayits a classic
not much else to say
i had of course played star craft before but my cd was long lost
it was nice to get this for nostalgias sakewhether you enjoy playing solo or going against other human beings online starcraft is one of the finest games you will ever find for either type of gameplaythere are three races the terrans or earthlings who look human and have human technology such as infantry tanks land mines nuclear missiles fighter planes etc the zerg who resemble the creatures from the alien movies their technology is all biological
it is grown from seedlike workers
all of their buildings regenerate health
they are able to create huge armies of creatures with little resources and the protoss an extremely advanced alien race which uses force fields and psychic energy to power up their unitsthe game teaches you to manage resources how to overcome obstacles and how to build a military base in such a way that it is both practical and defensible
do any of these things incorrectly and your forces will be overrun
you will also need to learn how to deal with tight situations such as when enemy infantry are suddenly dropped in the back corner of your base where you have few defenses
you have to deal with threats like this quickly before they tear your base apartthe online play is fantastic
you can have up to  players battling it out in huge vs matches everyone vs everyone or you can have say  human players vs  computer opponents or any combinationi must have played over  games online and have become skilled in the use of all three races
i must say however that i still come across several players whos skill dwarfs my own
its always challenging to play online because there are so many skillful playersif youre just browsing for a new game to check out this one will not disappoint you
if anything this is one which will addict you and draw you in for hundreds and perhaps thousands of hoursblizzard entertainment are one of the best that ever did itdiablo warcraft starcraftmany of which have earned game of the year status
they are all greatbest rts game ever play fast movement make every thing good not like other stragity game this one run fastestmy son wanted to play this game so we picked up two copies so that we could play together via battle netas old as this game is we love itterrific gamehi question if i order  purchase  pay for this pc game starcraft battle chest with my credit card will the payment be accepted this time instead of declined again like blazing angels part  you know the one for the ps i payed for on this website a couple of weeks back with  others that were able to come through except one which is the blazing angels part  for the ps this is an excellent buy
you are getting  quality games that will lead to endless hours of enjoyment
you have your choice of what type of life form you want and you have various structures to build compared to the common medieval games
if you enjoy this type of game i also highly suggest age of empires  and the expansion pack and empire earth
all highly recommendedstarcraft has caught me into the craze ever since its debut in this game is simply amazing
it is the type of rts that is quothard and fastquot you build build build fight fight fight and either win or  lose sometimes having the chance to revive if you lost the first battle
it is different from other great rts like aoe because the latter is more  fun when you build a great army w diverse units and attack tactically  while starcraft is more like building a giant swarm and either going  straight thru or catching the opponent by surprisewhat i mean is while  aoe resembles real combat more starcraft is idealistic but  funstarcrafts campaigns makes it standoutthe kerrigan story was  spectacular especially if you buy this battle chest and go thru the whole  story from the original to broodwar
blizzard hired some decent fiction  writers for the plotbattlenet and multiplayer rules in starcraft
in case you dont know battlenet gives you free access to the blizzard  server if you use the internet of course to meet and play multiplayer w  hundreds and even thousands of other people off the net of course its  only  people per game max
there is was
also a great ranking system  and tournaments but i dont know if they still do that anymore having my  internet connection gone extremely slow for the last  monthsall in  all this battlechest is a mustbuy and the guides help a lot in case  youre stuck but try to beat the game yourself i did it firstafter all these years starcraft is still the best rts choice by fans pc magazines around the world

i just hope blizzard make few more custom campaigns and put them on their website for downloading
starcraft battle chest has original starcraft starcraft expansion set brood war and two separate guide for each game for you to enjoy the world of starcraft
 go buy it now
youll be glad that you didstarcraft battle chest is a great addition to gaming
i love this game
i just bought it to get ready to play starcraft  i would definitely recommend the gamehalf life is definately the best shooter game
team fortress classic is a great addon
i do not intend on explaining features etc
this is just a great deal if you dont have half life yet definately buy this one years ago i was big in this game playing team fortress classic
its a server you play online with others
red team vs blue team and you play to capture the flag
great strategy
theres a variety of characters and each team needs just the right amount depending on your opponents team you may need to adjust yours and have somebody be a different class to help defend the fortress  capture the flag
classes are scout  heavy demolition man  sniper  soldier  spy  engineer  pyro  medic etc
a lot of fun playing any of these characters and each have their own attributes
while playing team fortress classic you can play just to have fun as a noob or get more involved with the game and play as if you were in the military
have a headset so you can chat with your team members to talk strategy while defending the fortress
communication is a must when it comes to military style games so if you knock down the opposing teams sentry guns or snipers or cleared their base of whatever whatever its good to let your other team members know so they can advance forward put more on offense than defensei purchased halflife  game of the year edition and saw there was no team fortress classic so i had to purchase the original halflife i highly recommend you play tf online
a typical round lasts  minutes and after those  minutes you get to see everybodys score whether its kills  point or capturing the flag  points
its good fun running into an opponent then backing away cause its a stale mate then throwing a grenade at a corner having it bounce off the wall and detonating he sees that and runs out in your line of sight where theres a friendly sentry gun engineer builds these right behind ya he runs into
engineers are extremely good as they have an emp grenade others dont they build teleports sentry guns and ammo stations while all the other classes are based more on speed health and their weapon damagebut my fun is being a sniper
one shot theyre done and whats better than seeing one of your team members up against a heavy weapons guy you snipe the hw guy and your team member is like oh thank you snipersplay team fortress classic and get involved
if youre into paintball this is for youhalflife is incredible
the story keeps pulling you along to see how it will all end
and with the incredible enemy ai and fantastic level design its utterly addictive
i like it so much because there are so many memorable scenes in the story
i played this game once before but never finished it
now that im playing thru again i remember battles that were particulary viscious  killing the monstrosity in the blast pit  having head crabs jump on you in the blackness of the tiny air shafts  fighting the soldiers as they lob grenades and work as a team  the ride on the railcar  ascending the nuclear core using the portals  the game is huge as well  ive put in at least  or  all daynight gaming sessions but im just now getting to the big buildup towards the end
i highly recommend this game and it is definitely deserving of all the  awards it has received since its release in now if i could just figure out how to configure the level editor worldcraft  i think i would enjoy trying my hand at level design
ive never messed with level editors before but worldcraft looks and sounds like its fairly intuitive if i was a techie i would have already figured it outi had this computer on my  machine and it was truly the best pc game i have ever played i have since moved on to ps
i just got an xp machine and it will not run
so beware
anyway if you are still on  or  this is a must have especially at this pricein low light and solitude i first imersed myself
my headphones and screen immediately presented the most humdrum plausible beginning for a reality based game you are going in to work
fade in to the interior of an automated tram car
a prerecorded voice welcomes you to the black mesa transit system
such inauspicious beginnings mark the first  minutes of the game and while it might sound boring it has a devious psychological purposefor you are gordon freeman reseach assistant
and the liesurely tram ride through the massive black mesa research complex provides subtle clues that everything in your life is about to go horribly wrong
sure everything seems normal just another day at the topsecret government laboratory right
yeah the gaurds grumble about their computers crashing and senior scientists berate you for being late but its just another one of those days at the officeheh heh hehyou actually percieve all of this through freemans eyes right in the game
like i said you must go into work at first
you run through bright institutionalized enviornments and chat with your coworkers as you rush to get to your work center on timefinally the big experiment
all you gotta do is don your protective hazardous enviornment suit go into the armored airlockaccessible chamber and follow some simple instructions
whats this
a senior scientist notices an anomoly as your team bombards an alien substance but quotits well within acceptable parametersquotboom
crash
spark
scream
oh no everything is exploding in showers of green energy
a massive bolt of radiation hits your coworkers observation post
the ceiling is caving inzap
heavy breathing
fade into a strange almost aquatic like landscape
zap
more breathing
more bizarre scenes
zap into unconciousnesswhen the real world fades back in klaxons blare
the experiment chamber is in shambles
sparks fly
the airlock has been blown open
you must get to safetybut as you try to retrace your steps you find the devestration has touched everybody and everything
all the quotboringquot scenes you walked through now lie in ruins and bloody corpses
welcome to black mesa
welcome to halflifethis whole opening sequence had me right where it wanted me
for the duration i was this games slave
i remember sitting in my chair and lifting a dazed look around my room after the disaster sequence
like keanu reeves all i could say was quotwhoaquot
i ended up played the game seven hours straight an unprecedent time spend on one game by mei liked many aspects of this game from the badguys to the weapons to the atmoshphere
this is the first game i played which actually creeped me out at times
that opening sequence played a good mind trip with immersing you into an everyday enviornment which spirals horribly out of control
but i can describe the weapons and beasties some other time
i think what i have shown you speaks for whether or not this game is a good investmenthalf life isnt a game its a way of life
the most involving and enjoyable game ever produced for the pc it pulls you into the world of gordon freeman and his escape from the black mesa research  facilityessential a first person shooter with style half life has  incredible graphics and attention to detail the helicopters being a fine  examplebe warned this game is huge it goes on for ages and never gets  boring
the slight downside is that theres a section at the end on xen  the alien planet which changes tack too much and can be frustrating to  completesimply put this game is the business from the introduction  sequence the alien ai the graphics and the smooth gameplay there is  nothing better
buy iti love the story i love the easter eggs i love everything about this game i give this game a im reviewing this game now having played it religiously for over  months
no game has ever held my attention for nearly so long a period
even though newer and probably better games are on the horizon to claim the   spot due to technology advancements halflife will likely forever hold  my fondest gaming memoriesin my opinion starcraft was the first game  to have truly amazing online support
including quick and easy updating  ease in finding fast games and a constant stream of new maps and game play  variations to keep it interesting
halflife with wonnet was the first  game to bring that kind of support to fans of firstperson fragging
single  player was great but once you visit the online halflife community kiss  your other hobbies goodbye
i praise valve for creating this game quite  possibly my favorite of all time
never has a fps had such amazing weapons  and welltuned multiplayer maps
thanks to wonnet finding online games  have been a snap with filters to find exactly what you are in the mood for  and a fast connectionlike starcraft again valve constantly released  free maps and variations including team fortress classic a whole other  game in itself which quite frankly deserves a fivestar rating of its own
with  unique classes and goals more detailed then simply killing tfc  added cunning and strategy to a gaming genre that previously relied on  reflexes and the memorizing of maps
it truly feels as though you are on a  team in fierce competition
this game is a sportto top it off  halflife gamers themselves were able to make their own maps character  skins and mods propelling this game and its community into unbeatable  longevity
it has been more than a year and a half since this game has  come out and still new fps games are hard pressed to mimic its appeal
even though everyone must know its reputation by now i feel obligated to  pay tribute to this amazing gameit will be interesting to see if any  game will ever be able to match its popularity
my money is on valves next  game team fortress this is definelty the best game in the fps genre
it has brought so much to the table
the mindless blastfests ala quake and doom were fun but thiswow
there was shooting and an actually storyan accidental portal to the alien planet xen opening
trying to survive the aliens was hard enough
then the military is sent to help
and by help i mean cleanse the aliens as well as the scientists
so you are up against aliens marines and the black ops for a few levels
the gameplay is fun the puzzles range from easy to difficult the blackops levels and the part with the lasers and the misslethat took me forever
and i love throwing snarks at marinesthe single player game itself was a lot of fun
but even more came afterwords
all the mods that people have made
my favorite was the quotthey hungerquot trillogy
night of the living dead meets half life
pure genious
tfc and all the other online games are awesome i havent personally played them much not much of an online gamer
but i know that they would be lots of fun
opposing force was awesome although the horrendously horrible blue shift is a waste of cash
you owe it to yourself to buy and play this revolutionary fps game
i am happily awaiting its sequalyour name is gordan freeman
you have a phd in theoretical physics from  mit
you are well acquainted with classical physics relativity and  quantum mechanics
you presently work at a topsecret research compound in  new mexico called the black mesa research lab
however this is not going  to be just another typical day at the office
it will be a period that  will test you in ways that your education at mit did not prepare you  foryou are involved in an experiment that goes awry to put it  mildly
a dimensional portal opens up and all of these mean amp nasty  aliens have slipped thru they get meaner and nastier as the game goes on
you try to escape the compound picking up a variety of weapons to defend  yourself as you go along
the weapons include  a crowbar also good for  opening up boxes of supplies a pistol a  magnum very cool a  shotgun an automatic machine gun wa grenade launcher hand grenades   some experimental weapons being researched in various levels of the lab  and other stuff
you will need them all for the task that awaits  youhowever the story does not end there
at the third scenario  marine recon shows up
the scientists all think that they are there to  rescue them
wrong
the marines are actually there to eliminate all  evidence that anything ever happened which means they are to whack both  the aliens as well as the scientists
so now you have to fight your way  thru heavily armed marines as well as violenceprone aliens who really  really seem to dislike youone of the nice things about this game  however is that not everyone is against you
from time to time you come  across scientists amp security guards who are on your side amp you can  ask for and receive their assistance to help you thru tough spots
the  plot to the game itself is quite good too about as elaborate as youre  ever going to find in a roleplaying game
i understand that one of the  writers for the game is actually an author of horror novels
way  coolyou can also play the game online
while playing the  multiplayer mode via the internet has precious little to do wthe actual  cd game it is addictive nonetheless
some scenarios are freeforalls  where you run around picking up weapons amp shooting at anything and  everything that moves
other websites let you play on teams  its  capturetheflag with hand grenades amp flame throwers my  favorite
i would not recommend this game for everyone tho
i would  advise against getting this game for children
it is certainly the most  obnoxious game i have ever played
it has more action and gore than most  horror amp action films
the d accelerated graphics make it seem all  too real from the mangled body parts to the blood human and alien that  is smeared all over the walls and floors
i would also admonish people who  suffer from claustrophobia or vertigo to think twice about buying this  game
there are many times that you have to go thru tiny crawl spaces  such as ventilator shafts and have to work from in high places many  times falling a time or two until you learn how to get thru them
also in  the game are many places where you must traverse areas laden with toxic  sludge as well as machines that will smash you to bits if your timing isnt  right
definitely not for the feint of heartbut if you enjoy  topnotch action games that are not short on plot and violence this game  is for you
you get to be a theoretical physicist who is every green  berets worst nightmare
richard p feynman would have loved this gameplay halflife and find yourself hardpressed to find a more beautifully laidout strategized and perfected on a relative scale of course game to come out of the industry
easily within classic status among the best of the best halflife still manages to have detractors
my best guesses as to their reasoning are to a couple of factors strict console gamers would have a hard time developing a liking for pc style firstperson shooters and quite honestly the game is odd
your vantage point never leaves the firstperson you never hear your character speak he is never out of your controlcutscenes or otherwiseand youre often presented with gruesome scenes of carnage and death
plus the game feels powerful which can be slightly discomforting
guns recoil and grenades are lobbed with incredible realism for  but still true for today and the artificial intelligence is so seemingly real that youll be surprised to see you arent hooked up to a networkthe fact is halflife is an experience and it may not be for everybody although sales figures would suggest otherwise
the emotions sweat and stress caused by playing halflife are the results of developer valves desire to up the ante for the video game market
and boy did ever they succeednormally im not  for buying extra copies but halflife did just that
i myself have a personal story of going into the store to get somethingonly to end up with a brand new original copy of halflife in that famous original box not the somewhat worse but still palatable one you see here for the goty versionyes you know that you can easily patch any version and that halflifes counterstrike modification has kept this game pulling more players than the top other games combined
the number of mod projects for this title are staggering and valve software is making sure to get every last bit of performance out of this one until the next big thing which sources have us believe will be quite soon and quite big and no i wouldnt say its cs were talking about something else
are there any bad things about this gamewell the graphics still are the best thing that my venerable old packard bell with  mhz genuine intel pentium ran with its  mb of edo ram and extremely primitive  mb s virge card
still it ran
often the graphics seem ugly in comparison to other newer and supposedly better things but they work and if you care about winning in cs this seems a secondary concernif anything dont buy this for the standalone game butfor goodness sakeget online and try out some of those mods
you deserve itwow
rarely am i as floored as i was when i popped in halflife for the first time
this is done with the quake  engine
i certainly couldnt tell
when you first get off the train in the beginning a security guard  talks to you and his mouth even moves although one of the scientists  looks like he talks out of the side of his mouth
of course other games  do this now but halflife was one of the first when it came out and my  mouth dropped open
when i entered the facility another guard talked and  told me that his computer crashed and was going to get it fixed
trust me  theres plenty of other scenes like this that will make you wonder if its  a movie or a game
everything is just so realistic
whats the catch
nothing
listen to the gaming magazines and web sitesbuy it
youll  be glad you didmany of you know this game from the publicity it got from counterstrike
many of you counterstrike players might not know of this game
but you should this game back when it was released  was ahead of its time it introduced the puzzle element it fps games the cinematic feeling you got when you play the role of gordon freeman a scientist working at the black mesa anomalous materials research center
if you havent yet bought this game or havent yet even tried it
it is definately a game you should have on your shelve at home
i have been seeing reviews right here on this sight saying that the graphics are dated well duh they are the game is  years old and still kicking with a multiplayer gaming community that is larger than quake  unreal tournament  amp battlefield  combined
and is still growing
this game is a part of history if you want to be involved in this history than i suggest you buy this game
this game has by far the most modifications out for it than any other game out there with striving mod communitys such as svencoop natural selection science amp industry amp the yet to be released halflife rallyi also noticed some reviewers saying the game is really buggy or people cheat alot
that is true the game can be buggy at times and people do cheat but there is no way of avoiding that in any game
valve has tried their hardest to stop the cheating with their valve anitcheat technology
they have also released many patches from the start to fix most of the bugsi end my spiel right here saying please buy this game and come join the ever growing community of halflife
who knows maybe ill see one of you ingame
if you do see me dont mind to say hi most people that play are nicehalflife seems to have been around forever but its still as popular as it was when it first graced us with a frenzy of action
nothing against quake doom and duke but valve really upped the ante for fps gamesquake is just a shoot fest that doesnt offer much enjoyment in the single player mode outside of practice for multiplayer
halflife however involves problem solving and a knack for pressing the f key on a regular basis
quick save this is the only game i have that can spook me
i get so into the stage sneaking around and all when a baddie pops out ive been known to develop a nervous tickthe greatness of this game is only partially realized in single player mode
multiplayer is where halflife truly shines
with different levels that the singleplayer mode and a slew of downloadable mods this is the best multiplayer thing going
counterstrike tfc player skins weapons bots etc make this game seem to never run out of new things to donothing beats mulitplayer on a lan with this game
my roommates and i have wasted many an hour blowing each other up and setting up traps to crossbow people in
if you like a good single player game love multiplayer action and dont have this yet what cave have you been livin in
get with it manthis game was awarded over  game of the year awards back in  and it deserved every damn one of them
the single player game utterly blows away the competition with a rocket launcher
it is fun to play scary as hell  and very atmospheric
the artificial intelligence ai is some of the best  ever seen
for once the enemies you face are quite capable of taking you  ongreatyou say but what about multiplayer
thanks to the inclusion  of team fortress classic which is worth the price of admission all by  itself halflife can hold its own in the battle for your online time
with multiple character classes each with its own strengths and  weaknesses this is a game that truly emphasizes cooperation
for once  believe the hype and buy this gamethis is plain and simply the best game i have ever player or ever expect to play
sure some games have better graphics some have more action but nothing except halflife including its mildly dissapointing sequels has ever so brilliantly encompassed a great story great gameplay great characters and great strategyit was a normal day for you gordan freeman an employee at the black mesa research facility deep in the bowels of the new mexico desert
sure the computer system had been screwy but your job was easy enough don a hazard suit and do the task detailed to you by the scientists in charge
but then things went horribly awry the shutdown procedure failed and only the hazard suit you were wearing saved your life
you must make it to the surface but the normal routes have been blocked off by the unforseen consequences of the experiment
hapless unarmed scientists and rogue security guards may be some help but aside from the weaponry youll find youll have to rely on yourself to fight off the hordes of aliens spawned by the resonance cascadeeverything about this game is brilliant
sure its story penned not by some computer programmed but genuine scifi novelist mark laidlaw of a scientific experiment gone wrong isnt exactly novel but the fact that the game sticks with the story instead of using it as a clothesline for action sequenced makes up for it
the weapons which number about  are healthily balanced between realistic and original and are spaced throughout the game so that the player does not find all of them in ten minutes
the npcs can be funny and are often helpful the enemies ruthless and cunningthere is no game i can reccomend more highly do yourself a favor and play this game as soon as possiblethis is one of the best games ever produced
it is practically responsible for the existence of the steam gaming service and its parent company valve
i give this game  stars and couldnt recommend it more highly despite its dated graphics
no game collection is complete without all the halflife games including all the halflife  gameshowever i would strongly suggest purchasing the halflife anthology set instead of this version at this point simply because it is far cheaper
the halflife anthology set also includes the halflife expansions known as halflife opposing force and halflife blue shift
while the expansions arent nearly as widely loved as the original halflife you can get both them and the original halflife in the halflife anthology pack available on steam as a digital download for a far cheaper price around  bucksi would also strongly recommend poking around on steams website for something called the halflife highdefinition pack
its a pack you can get and easily install from steams official website that significantly enhances the graphics in these old halflife games
though i cant remember for sure i think they make it easy for you with autoinstallationthe halflife series is absolutely unrivaled
dont miss out on it
 starshalflife came out for pc in  people played it people lovedit
it recieved over  game of the year awardes
 halflifeopposing force comes out
it gets very good reviewsthen counterstrike comes out that gets a best multiplayeronline game award
then blue shift comes out gets good scoresit also includes a halflife hd package which uppon installingmakes the graphics look good
then halflife is ported to theps with even fancier graphics
after almost  years halflifestill is the greatest
it starts out simple
you are a scientistnamed gordon freeman who is working a tipical day at theblack mesa research facility
but suddenly a teleportationexperiment goes wrong spawning aliens and destroying thefacility
all the doors are shut and the tram system destroyedso you must find a way to make it to the surface
the militaryare supposed to rescue you but you find out that they justwant to silence you and your coworkers and make sure that allevidence of the alien outbreak is concieled
this game isthe perfect first persion shooter
periodthis game is the best on the pc
its also the best first person shooter out there so far
the action is awesome and explosivegameplay  great gameplay
it really requires tactics then just running in front a squad of troops and firing your mp like a maniac
there are not a great variety of guns though but really great
the multiplayer also rocks including counter strike
the ai are probably the smartest of all videogames
they duck strafe group up like real soldiers
if they see you at a distance theyll throw a grenade
the aliens are really coolgraphics  fine but not the best
the environments are well donestoryline  the storyline is really great
especially how the story fits with the gameplaythis is the story you are a scientist named gordan freeman and you made a accident at the black mesa reasearch center causing all these alien hordes to enter the facility
the goverment sent forces to kill everything at the facilityyou must try to save your own skinsound  great sound effects especially the guns as realistic as possibledifficulty  this game will probably take up  hours or more to beat it is incredebly hard cause the ai is too smartoverall  great game must buy for fps fanswhen halflife first came out in  i was about  years old and i really wasnt into video games
but come late  halflife  came out and when i read the pc gamer review and saw some screenshots i went to gamestop to get it
the guy at the counter asked me if i had played halflife
i told him no
he then said since i was under  he had no obligation to sell me the m rated game halflife  until i had bought played and beaten halflife
so i bought halflife went home loaded it and started playing
imediatly i was suprised at how good the graphics were especially for a game from  the graphics in halflife could easily compete with many of the games in the s
also the sound extremely good hearing the slightest of noises
the story is pretty basic but good enough to keep you interested in that area
you are gordon freeman researcher at black mesa labs
your expirement has gone very wrong releasing a bunch of aliens into the labs
the government has sent soldiers in to clean things up and you are faced with fighting for your life against aliens and human soldiers
the gameplay is awesome and the weapons are very good
online play is fabulous especially if you have counterstrike
so despite call of duty doom  the battlefield series warcraft  neverwinter nights or any other game that is mindblowing halflife is the best game i have ever played and in my opinion the best game everhalflife deserves more than  stars
it is the new king of computer games surely the best first person shooter ever made
you play gorden freeman a  year old research associate in the black mesa research facility
the game has  very large and strong levels plus two starting levels and one end game level and it has a game ending that  of the gamers would say it is the best ever and  would say the worst ever if you ask me it is the best ending ever for a pc game story it has got two great endings a climax and an anti climax
right from the start youre engaged in events like riding a train to work finding the locker room and suiting up and then heading for the test lab
the experiment in the test lab goes very wrong and alien beings are teleported through the portal that opened and the goverment wants to cleanup the mess completly including you
you must fight your way through the aliens and the commandos and be teleported to a distant planet to cleanup the mess that was created
the game starts and ends on a train
what i really like about half life is that there are no cutsences the whole story is through the eyes of gordan i hate it when games take the controls away from the playerhalf life has the best graphics ever in a computer game dont worry if you dont have a d card you dont need them the software rendering itself is as good as directd or opengl
valves artists and sound artists should win awards for their contribution to halflife
the charecters look so real that you really feel sorry for them when they get killed
not only does the game look and feel like the science lab but its monstors and live wire electricity effects all come alive
the graphics of fire and water are simply superb so life like
the sound in half life is very clear that you could understand what the scientist and commandos are talking very clearly the explosions and the gunfire sounds along with the graphics give a real war like atmosphere
the sound track in halflife the opening music is fantastic
half lifes level designing is superb the black mesa is a great place to hang arround
the levels are so beautifully desinged and they are very strong and the puzzles are very challenging
surface tension is my favorite level
there are  weapons but why did the makers have just  keys for them most of the weapons have secondary fire mode
this is the first game were living creatures are used as weapons the small alien crab like thing and the hand of an alien leave your charecter alone for sometime holding a weapon and you will see him play with it
the commandos are more challenging to fight than the aliens expecially the black dressed woman assasins in the levels apprehension and lambda complex
fighting them feels as if you are suddenly in a multiplayer game
half lifes loading time is really fast and quick save and quick load lives up to its name only in half lifehalflife has the best multiplayer playability in action games and probably the most easy to use interface ever
halflife is a must for all fps fans
i cant understand how myst is still the best selling game ever
there is absolutely nothing wrong in halflife it is probably the most perfect game ever made there should be a prize to persons who find real fault with half life
the npcs look alike but thats understandable in all games two out of ten charecters look alike it bothers only in half life because they look so real for people who find that as a big con let me tell you if valve decided that each charecter must have a different then half life wouldnt be half complete today
some people think xen is not fun to play thats because you are in the science lab and all of a sudden you are in xen and could not handle the sudden atmosphere change xen is fun to play
half life is a very well planned and polished game that it is very shinning
and it is the only game which has not crashed on my system
forget quake ii or unreal buy half life you would not regret itit wasnt labeled game of the year in its day for no reason
it was the basis for spawning the decade long running classic online shooter counter strikeit is very fun to play and with a deep story line
collect this and the entire series and you will have something truly fun and entertaining to share with the grand kids years from now when they want to see those old games that pop pop used to play
lolabsoulutly incredable
everything was approched in this game sound stratagy lighting level design and graphics
it is darn good stuff
also the counterstrike mod is enough of a reason to buy it
this game  definatly deserves game of the year
well done sierraman o man this is an excellent game
this is thee best first person shooter i have ever played
most first person shooters dont really have a plot its just shoot everything around and dont think twice about it
in half life there is a deep and interesting plot
its still shoot everything in site but it has a plot and thats important
it is also nice to be able to use security gaurds and scientists
ever since i got the game i havent been able to put it down yet
the add on counterstrike is even more addicting yet
all and all it is a great game and a must havei love this game it scares me so bad
i never had that happen before and im only talking about single player mode
multi player rocksa modern classic this is an finelyhoned first person shooter with a compelling story some excellent action setpieces great presentation and a groundbreakingly perfect musical score
it reeks of quality and stinks  of class  the creators obviously cared about making a good game and that  simple fact sets halflife apart from everything else
now almost two  years old halflife is still just as good as it was and it could be  released tomorrow and still make the same impact
its an embarrassment of  riches with too many good things to count  in amongst the  seeminglyintelligent soldiers giant tentacles amusingly jingoistic  security guards and radioactive water the game almost offhandedly solves  the problem of how to tell a story with a computer game  and its  extremely immersive
you really need to play it with headphones or an  expensive stereo
everything from the plausible gloomy environments to  the metallic chatter of your machinepistol fits the atmosphere perfectly  and theres a sparse scary set of musical cues which mix ambient techno  with noisemusic
its even excellent fun as a multiplayer game or even in  related team fortress form
its rockhard too but in a way that makes  you want certain bits again and again
all told its a classic and you  should own it already plus the mission packits not perfect though  although familiarity has no bred contempt
the narrative flow breaks down  in the final alienbound levels which are a disappointment after the  recognisably realworld environments in the rest of the game
on the alien  world there are a couple of places where you can be inextricably stuck  too which seems unfair
some of the creature designs dont seem to fit  either  whilst the mutated scientists and headcrabs are fantastically  hateable the hulking waspfiring alien sergeants seem to belong to  another game entirely
play it in the dark for the first time and youll  be scared to death tooit makes blood  look amazingly implausibly  badok lemme just say thisll be a long review
first ill review halflife then tfc
it deserves a little review doesnt it
in hl single player youre gordon freeman normal scientist late for a day at work at black mesa research facility
when a test goes wrong at work the poo hits the fan and soon youre fighting for your life against mutated former comrades and aliens from the border world to clear out an escape route to the surface and to safety
to top it all of the administrator commonly dubbed the gman has gotten the military involved to erm clean things up meaning eliminate all survivors alien or humanhowever you wont be alone
youll have fellow scientists to help you along the way right before they get a shotgun blast to the head if youre that nomercyfornpcs type and security guards to offer some cannon fodder while you make your escape and to open doors you cant to make your way outthis thing is incredible and the sequences make it even better
who can forget the scientist screaming as he plunges down the vacant elevator shaft
made me watch my stepand the ominous music right before you step into a room and rock begins plunging down over your head
walk up to a scientist wounded and hell pull out a syringe saying hold still this wont hurt a bit
free heal
lead a barney towards an enemy and hell yell die you bloodsucker
before shooting
might i mention the voices are great
i also enjoyed the beginning walking past a table with a scientist sitting at a table enjoying some coffee or another tying his shoe or another saying someones hidden my glasses againunfortunately there arent many skins for the barneys security guards or scientists
but thats a nitpick
i know some people didnt like xen eitheranyway sp is definetly worth playing through unlike some gameson to tfcif your looking for teamplay you got yer candy right here
players can choose classes such as the heavy weapons guy or engineer all of which have different skills pros and cons
most of the maps are great well and fort are good simple ctf favorites while slightly more complicated scenarios such as flagrun canalzone hunted or dustbowl are fun as well
except many call dustbowl spambowl because of the excessive amount of thrown grenadesconstantlyi enjoy tfc over hldm because of the variety
sometimes i play medic and heal my teammates amid explosions
others i play engineer and set up a sentry gun to defend our flag
or maybe i might play pyro and enjoy setting enemies on fire
and if im feeling frustrated
ill break out the heavy weapons guy just hold down the button and shoot at what movesall in all halflife is great
id highly reccommend it for anyone wanting story gameplay replayability and fun in one big package
dont forget the thousands of downloadable levels online the rats style levels in which you are  inches tall in a bathroomkitchenlivingroomect are personal favoriteswellwhere to begin
this game is excellent
thats basically all i need to say
its main game has a nice plot your a scientist whose expieriment went wrong and you must do some stuffand shoot stuff along the way
most enemies are smart and tactically try to kill you and the quotpuzzlesquot are fun too
plus deathmatch is fun and all the quotmodsquot by other people make the game infinately replayableif you like first person shootersaction games at all you simply must try thishalflife is one of the best fps ever made
the story is goes like this you are gordon freeman a scientist working at a top secret labratory in new mexico called the black mesa research facility
when doing a normal routine science experiment things go terribly wrong and you have opened a portal between an alien world and the black mesa research facility
the point of the game is to fight your way to the surface and make it out alive
but that is no easy challenge for the alien ai is smart and the damage they can cause can be severeyou also fight soldiers trying to cover up the experiment and trying to eliminate all the witnesses
you will die many times but somewhere inside you you have the courage to keep on going
there are also many weapons to choose from in this game but u must find them first
these are some examples there are too many to list ill just list the basics mp submachine gun with a m grenade launcher on it glock pistol crowbar for wacking aliens rocket launcher grenades shotgun crossbow and trip bombs
there are many others too
this game is not only very hard but very long
on easy mode it took me about  and a half months to beat it
that sounds crazy but its worth it and soon youll find yourself addicted and not being able to stop clicking the mouse button
i highly reccommed this game to all fps addicts
a must have
patrickhalflife is easily the best game ever made no doubt about it
the graphics are a little out dated but thats okay the gameplay more than makes up for it
it isnt perfectly realistic but it comes very close to it
for one you can carry  weapons at a time but thats the case it most shooters
and head shots dont kill
but besides that the game is very realistic
guns are in logical places not just lying there as with health health powerups arent just sitting there instead you get health at refill pump which also are in very logical places
now as the plot goes the most brilliant part in the game
you are a scientist who works at black mesa reseach facility and are working on a very big project which goes very wrong warping aliens to the lab
now the lab is infested with deadly aliens and you are the only one who can save you fellow scientists
wanna find out what happens
then buy the gameim not a fan of firstperson shooters  i get bored with just killing targets too quickly and the rapid movements necessary invariably make me  nauseous
halflife is different it makes me think it has a mysteryladen  storyline and it looks marvellous
the visuals sounds and effects are  bloody perfect
not only that the opponents are very crafty  i was  surprised to see one beast actually duck behind cover when i shot at iti was in about sixth grade when this came out or at least when my dad bought it
i still love it and its very realistic yet also fun to play as well
its unbelievably fun
games today focus too much on realistic graphics rather than good story lines or good gameplay
i hope to be a video game designer one day and i wanna make games that are more like the older ones such as this
older video games give me a more comforting feeling than these games today that have stories that are more like real life than being fun
halflife all three of them will always be among my favorite video games ever and even if you run out of ammo and have to start the whole game over again so what
its worth it
its worth every single pennythis is a great game to own and it is really fun but dont expect a direct story being told to you like modern gamesalso many people that have played counter strike will also enjoy this because this game is where the concept came from because if half life didnt exist counter strike would never exist at all
many cs players  especially international cs players dont even know about half life and that is just plain sad lol but oh well they are missing out on a great gameyes doom was the beginning of the fps genre as we know it
but halflife marked the beginning of an evolutionary leap for the genre
quite simply put halflife is and will remain one of the greatest games ever
i really cant put the gameplay experience into words but i remember when i first played this game almost ten years ago i was absolutely absorbed
seriously
absorbed
at the time the mods were sharp fun and novel
counterstrike
firearms
team fortress classicman those were fun daysif you havent played this game you need to experience it and understand what it has done to the world of firstperson shooters
the enemies
the weapons
the music
the levels
the creativity
its a cinematic experience in itself and youre the starthe halflife games are the thinkingpersons fpss and the series is this reviewers favourite game franchise
the original game does look a bit dated by the standards of  but bearing in mind that it was first released in  it still looks pretty good and in its day it was truly groundbreaking
it also used a physics engine that was the best of its time and an ai that performed far better than any other
almost everything you could want is here a good variety of environments some satisfying puzzles and some challenging combat
it also has within the obvious limits of a shooter a solid and engaging story
all of this makes for a game that keeps you entertained from start to finish and never outstays its welcome
great stuff  and it gets much much better with halflife me and my dad play this game together but i never got into playing  player by myself
i downloaded team fortress classic and this game is instantly transformed in to the grtest game of all
tfc is the best  multiplayer mod ever
you get to duke it out while being a medic soldier  sniper heavy weapons guy demolition man and a spy
i have never  seen another game so addictive and innovative
i would buy this game just  for mutltiplayer
you should buy this game this game makes you  proud to own
the story so cool the fragging so great
all the reviews are  true this is the game of the year but i think this is the game of the  centurythis must be what they call a pageturner in the world of books
you just cant stop playing it
it has one of the best story lines in a game ever and without doubt the best story in a fps ever
this one is going to be  hard to follow up and it must be seen as the new standard in fps from now  on youll be talking about halflife clones instead of doom and quake  clonestreat yourself with the luxury of half life and youll never  regret itdoesnt have the eye candy graphics of half life  but keeps you playing and engrossed for hourssure there are many great first person simulations out there right now
but by any measure this is one of the best
i can get really caught up in this game
i have jumped out of my seat in fear and really enjoyed  knocking off anybody or anything that does not wish me good health
if  you liked doom quake etc
than buy this game right nowthis is without a doubt one of the most fantastic games aviliable ever for the pc if not the best
it contains amazing graphics even if you dont have a d accelerator
it has a envolving story line and challenges you to  solve puzzles and unravel what happened after an explosion turns your  colleagues into aliens
but parents watch out
this game contains extreme  gore involving you to shoot and kill enemies resulting in buckets of gore  as well as severed heads bloody limbs and the persons heart
this can be  turned off but trails of blood still remain very bloody as well as the  scare factor
if your over  id say you can handle it but anyone under   should not get this gamesimply put hl is the scariest alienshootinest headsplatterinest crowbarswinginest cartpushinest headcrabkillinest vent crawlinest best game everi played the modification of half life counterstrike and was amazed at the realism
i played it at my friends house and only thought of half life as a barrier between me and counterstrike i played counterstrike for a couple nights and sucked it up because i hadnt even tried halflife so i thought id just use half life as a trainer for counterstrike again not expecting much
i was sucked into the story line by the second chapter
my only complaint with the game is that it didnt rely much on me helping out the other scientists in sticky situations but half life  is coming out and im sure that that will make up for the badstuff
the game took me almost  hours of game play to beat on normal settings and except for like  parts in it that i got frustrated they were the most intense  hours of my life
the two parts that werent fun were in the trams and killing the nihilith or whatever its called
take my advice and buy this game right now its only  dollars id gladly pay twice that for just the single player buy it for both counterstrike and the singleplayer thoughstill going strong after all these years
goofy graphics compared to the later games but stillits half life
great gamebackback on january rst when i first saw halflifei half to admit one of the best scifi games of all timeyou are gordon freeman a scientist working at a decommsionedmilitary secret facility where scientists and security gaurdsblend with technology in the year  which was not thoughtpossible one day when scientist in the quotanomolous materialslaboratoryquot where conducting a dangerous but pure and rarespecimen to a test chamber filled with laser beam like technology but the scientist went to farplus they opened upa worm hole between a border world believed to be called quotxenquotafter the disatirous experiment aliens are killing everyone andtearring apart the facility while expolisions ensure and affectthe place the goverment finds out and comes for you and killsanything in sight including you
enough is scrambling to stayalive for you when so much is about to happen
the graphics backthen in this game were impresssive the sound is above averagefrom my opinion back then the music is great and basically iplayed the game for  years
i have to admit this is a execellent worth while game yet today things have changedps
iwould recommend customers to buy this gamehalf life is truely the best game ever made a milestone in gaming history
half life lives up to its popularity
the game is fun to play
the story is also exciting
get this game right now if you still havent lived itthis game is brilliant
its my first game in the knight series and i was completely immersed in the game right from the very beginningthe plot comprises of a supernatural mystery
the story is great and the characters are amiable
each character is well drawn as a subplot that contributes well to the main plot
the identity of mr baza is quite a surprise by the end
the subplot between gabriel and grace is open ended
mystery freaks wouldnt mind replaying the game over and over again along with those who would like to get the total score of game play is easy
you are caught in time blocks and to complete each time block you have to perform certain series of required actions
this is what i liked best about the game because you get the feeling that you are moving in the right direction and hence you neednt worry about replaying any part of the gameat times i got stuck solving the mystery and had to take a look at hint sites and found out that nothing is impossible in any mystery game if you really have the time and patience to look into every nook and cornerthe ending was great
oh i simply loved the puzzles once gabriel enters the cave
they were fun
i do have one complaint with this game  i wish it didnt have to end at all starsjane jensen is one of the few games designers still around capable of creating an interesting pointandclick adventure game the few other recent exceptions being the designers of monkey island and grimm fandango and it is fortunate that sierra kept her on even while they decided to destroy the adventure game division they built themselves upon and fire most of their best designers
while most games have puzzles that have very little connection to whatever storyline they manage to put together hi dreamcatcher the puzzles in gkiii are very well integrated into a rich storyline
some of them are quite difficult to figure out you can always find hints on the net but once you do figure it out you dont feel cheated for your efforts because the solutions always make logical sense although you might have chosen a different tactic in real life
janes puzzles also involve more than finding different objects lying on the ground and clicking them randomly on hot spots
for one thing the environment is too rich and nonlinear for this to work
the player is actually rewarded for thinking
the game environment is very rich
there are locations that arent significant to game play but are still fun to go back and explore and add to the overall experience
you can wander off and engage in conversations that you missed out on the first time you played the game and each detail adds to the richness of the storyline
the storyline itself is wonderful based on the reallife mystery of rennes le chateau read holy blood holy grail for its history or the big book of conspiracies for a nice short overview
even without the puzzles it is a fun entertaining and educational interactive movie experience
spoiler warning skip to next paragraph  unfortunately towards the end when she strays from the known history of the bloodline it gets a bit silly it was not necessary for her to rewrite the quotoriginquot of jesus and create a silly one for the vampires in order to get the vampires into the story they could have just found out about the bloodline like anyone else and gone after the child for the special qualities of its blood the production values are wonderful great soundtrack great voice cast etc
my one complaint is that tim curry gets a bit silly with his voiceover at times but it gets better as the game progressespersonally i was disappointed by the graphics
the new emphasis on d environments in adventure games is saddening
while it does make pointofview movement more interesting the characters look like unreal homonculi and the architecture sometimes feels like youre playing doom i  you never forget you are playing a computer game
it worked better with grimm fandango where the characters are supposed to look inhuman and the environments are less navigable and therefore more fully designed
there is still something to be said for fully rendered graphics which allow artists to create more fullyrealized environments
perhaps d games will eventually be as interesting to look at as they are to move around in but not yetthis is the third time when a gabriel knight fan can meet hisher hero in the adventure game by sierra studios
and i do not dare to say that gabriel knight  blood of the sacred blood of the damned is the best adventure game ever created
let me clarify it story games created by jane jensen were always wellknown for their perfect storyline which draws you into its mystery from the very beginning and reveals all secrets and the very end
this game is not an exception  gabriel is invited to france by prince james of albany to explore enigmatic nature of his only son which as a descendant of very ancient and hermetical family is in danger of kidnapping
gabriel and grace accept the invitation and meet prince in his mansion
the troubles come very early  although all doors and windows are securely shut and guarded princes kid is kidnapped at night by two strange visitors
gabriel immediately pursues the kidnappers and after following them to a train and hearing them say quotsan grealquot he is suddenly bumped to his head and falls to unconsciousness
he wakes up in a station of couiza and losts the track of kidnappers in a small village renneslechateau fabulous with mysteries more than two thousand years old
gabriel starts to face one of the most fearsome investigations he ever did and asks himself the most curious questions
can be kidnappers related to a tour group of treasure hunters who share the local hotel with gabriel
what really is the holy grail
can be vampires involved in the case
and who is still one step before him game system gabriel knight goes to d in the most original and playable way you can imagine
all landscapes interiers persons and objects are beautifully modelled and animated in realtime
moreover you can place your view camera anywhere to see every detail you want
it means that you can explore all objects in your current scene without moving gabriel or grace which pushes the playability even higher
in noninteractive animations the camera automatically finds the best location
what more could you want dialogues if you played sins of the fathers you will be more than happy that gabriels voice is provided by tim curry again
wow
other characters are also spoken very pleasantly with a little french accent which perfectly fits the environment music the soundtrack maintains the high level established in the first two gabriel knight games
it greatly completes all kinds of scenes and makes you shiver in dangerous game parts other there are several original features which i never seen in any other adventure game  sidney computer  using this computer to analyze mysterious documents and search hidden messages in images is simply excellent and unforgetable  open architecture  you can extract any picture character sound music etc
from the game and replace it by your ownso what is the conclusion
if you are not familiar with adventure games try to start with this one
i guarantee that you will not be disappointedtruly a great adventure game
now i was an quotoldschoolquot fan of adventure games back when developers cared about that genre
now adventure gaming is a dying breed with only about one or two new adventure games coming out a year and most of those slipping through the cracks where only devoted fans hear about them
true fans are forced to the classics
now this game in my mind is one of the true great adventure games along with the monkey island series space quest series and heros quest series
the game itself may confuse some nonadventure gamers who dont understand the point of adventure games but it will leave a great taste in your mouth when you finish it
regardless if you played the past two gabriel knight games you can pick up the plot pretty easily and it draws you in and never lets go
sneaking around churches and cellars hearing screams and seeing claw marks help set the mood of terror and suspense throught the whole game
this game is similar to one of the movies where the movie dosent become great until the end when it all wraps up
a must buy for adventure fans and for those gamers sick of shooting the same space aliensin a world that makes it hard to find a pure adventure game not an adventureaction combo game where i dread the boring action part and cant wait until it is over plus what is the point the big group of action people dont want adventure and many adventurists dont want action  they try to please all and up end up pleasing few let alone a fun one this was a blast
the second in the series was the besti cant say that the graphics are the best ive ever seen  the backgrounds are gorgeous but with a lot of things expecially the people youd think the game designers had never heard of a curve in their lives
however the game itself made me forget about all that
gabriel knight is his usual chauvanistic self but in spite of that his relationship with grace is further developed in this game
the puzzles vary in difficulty but i never felt as if any of them were impossible
its easy to see that a lot of research went into the story in this game and after finishing the game i was interested enough to read some of the books they got their research from theres a bibliography in the games bookletamazingly enough this game is also replayable  if you do the minimum amount of things necessary to win this game you still wont have seen everything in the game
there are places you dont have to go things you dont have to see and even alternative ways of achieving the same goal that all create reasons to play this game again
except those areas of the game where you can die or get caught by the bad guys none of that will change how the game ends but its still interesting to go back and look for the things you missed  you even get points for the things you do so you can tell how close you are to seeing everything the game has to show you
and for those of you who like me play these kinds of adventure games because you dont like getting killed or having to kill things dont worry most of that happens at the end of the gamei have a large history in playing adventure games i own such classics as the mokey island trilogy fate of atlantis day of the tentacle full throttle grim fandango and sam amp maxi can heartily say gabriel  knight  ranks among the best of them
merely on the strength of this  title i bought the first and second in the series and cannot wait to  begin them
the storyline is superb and i suggest after playing  the game you read up about the real history of rennes le chateau this just  shows how faultless jane jensons stroytelling abilities are
to say that  they ending is controversial is an understatement
the interface is smooth  akin to that of a d level designer and i cannot imagine playing another  adventure game without it
the graphics are for the most part great with  cartoony characters it is a real testamentpun not intendedplay the  game youll understand to the game desingers that despite the graphics  being cartoon in style the game can be scary in parts
despite not liking  tim currys gabriel to begin with the character grew on me and he  really becomes the character
other voice talent is also well donea  modern classici had high expectations going into gk and i was not disappointed
im a longtime adventure game fan and its been quite a while since ive played one of this calibre
ive always wanted the kind of total freedom  and interactivity the d engine provides
i hope sierra is planning to  use it again
additionally the storyline is firstrate and well plotted
gabriel and grace are very human characters and the way they relate to  each and develop was perhaps my favorite aspect of gk
also quite a  beautiful game
if you love a good story do buy itthroughout the years i have played all the quest for glory games and really enjoyed them
this latest one dragon fire is just as good if not better than the earlier releases
according to todays technology the graphics are a little cartoony but it is still a wonderful adventure game
so many times you get games with excellent graphics but rotten storylines
this isnt the case here
you get to customize your character and the neat thing is your actions determine what happens to you
you can play the game over several times and not experience the same things
it is also neat that characters from past games appear throughout your journey but it doesnt affect your gaming experience if youve never played the quest series
i think these days you can find dragon fire in bargain bins and of course here on amazon and it is wellworth spending a few dollars onquest for glory  dragon fire is not merely the end of a great series but the end of an era for the entertainment compant yosemite entertainment
as a great fan of the series quotheroquot has journeyed from the town of spielburg to the fogridden lands of mordavia raseir fricana not in this order  and finally the village of silmariain a game of this ilk graphics plays second fiddle to storyline and gameplay and it is in these two areas that qfg excels
transported to the island of marete and its capital silmariamodeled after ancient greece quotherosquot last adventure is fraught with peril and mystery
the music is professional orchestral with sweeping tones unlike any other game i have encounterednow to the plot
decades ago the peaceful island of marete was plagued by a dragon
seven pillars were constructed with ancient spells forcing the dragon into its lair
lately however following the brutal assasination of the king of silmaria invaders from distant lands rampage across the country pillaging mercilessly
compounding the trouble is the prophecy that the blood of a murdered being will destroy the pillars freeing the dragon from its enchantmentan enthralling plot filled with characteristic offbeat lorey and corey cole humor fantastic music and solid gameplay cement qfgs position as a good final instalment to the series and possibly the greatest of the quest for glory epics sure to please fans of the series and provide a closure in quotherosquot final adventurethis sadly was the end of the qfg series and to be honest it didnt sell very well too many people didnt like the new graphics that came with it making it look like a final fantasy game
however all sierra was doing was updating it and being creative and they came up with an amazing end game
it was like a  year pregnancy that took a fortune to make im sure as basically all of the old characters come back from other games a great reunion a new story the hero can get married and everything and even the ability to import a paladin even if you dont have one
this is an under rated classic that has stood its ground
i say if you can find it get ita lot of people didnt like quest for glory  when it was released but i love it
yeah the first time i played it the controls were different than the previous four games and it took some getting used to but once i got used to it i was in love
its got a nice tieupthelooseendshappilyeverafter feeling about it
and of course its got all the famous qg humorincluding the bad puns and the moose head
i have played this game i dont know how many times especially now that you can download a patch for xp it works greatthe first time i saw this game way back in the early s it looked interesting
what became of that was many years even including last year of playing it nonstop until i bought the d versionthe realism is  powerful and the improved d graphics make this one game that will no  doubt live forever in the pc gaming hall of fame
what makes this game  different from all other flight sims is the campaign mode
in the last  decade and even now nothing has even come close to the feeling of building  your pilot up in rank status and medals
when your pilot dies you feel  awful especially after days and even weeks of intense combat and  intrigue sometimes other famous pilots like the red baron will write  you a letter and challenge you to a duel
the campaign doesnt drag on  either because the war ends as it did in real life in  so you can  retire your score to the hall of fame board and start over trying to beat  your last pilotwho needs multiplayer
this game rocks and i have  never met a person who hasnt thought thought this game to soar beyond  other flight sims
the only others to come close are the good old lucas  games battle of britan and secret weapons of the luftwaffebuy this  now before it fades away and is pushed aside by evil marketing people who  care more about graphics and sound than fun
fun is what games are  about and red baron d is one of the last great games of the early days  that will always be there to go back to when flying games become ridiculous  and boring much they have already becomei originally gave this game a four star reviewit deserves five
since purchasing this ive tried many other games and none compare
for its market this game is number one
ive owned it now for over a year and still i enjoy it
only in books have i experienced the ability that this game has in pulling you into the subject
if you purchase this then youll see the mastery that the designers injected it with
happy flightsyes it is true
despite being released way back in what was it 
red baron d remains among the top tier of combat flight simsif you are looking for this classic sim the bad news is that all original published copies are sold out
the good news is that used copies are not hard to find
shop around and try to get the actual red baron d game and not the upgradeable red baron  also try and find a copy that includes the red baron d manual
this manual is chock full of everything you need to know about every aspect of the sim
there is also a large historical section devoted to the pilots and aircraft of the period covered in the sim and lots of period photos
it resembles a paperback novel more than manuals found with pc games these daysother good news is that although the gamesim is old it has been lovingly modded and kept up to date by a large community of artists and programmers
the game in its current state of modification hardly resembles the game as it was originally shippedthe campaign in rbd remains to this day the standard to which all others are held
really there is nothing else in the world of d flight sims that can compare to it
it is the key reason why so many have been flying and modding this sim over the years
very little about the campaign is scripted
once you take off from your aerodrome how events unfold from then on depends largely on the decisions you make while in the air
while flying a mission there is a real sense of a war going on all around you
looking off into the distance dogfights and ground fire that have nothing to do with your mission can be seen unfolding
i have seen planes little more than specks in the distance spinning out of control towards the  earth shot down out of the sky trailing smokethe game was programed to run with the now extinct voodoo video cards and glide api
there is a program called dgvoodoo that can be downloaded and installed that allows modern ati and nvidia cards to run the game in glide otherwise the game runs in direct draw and doesnt look nearly as sweetanyway i wanted to write up this review because the sim is still in use and message boards with enthusiastic modders and simmers from all over the world are currently active and they are a great place to get  started and ask qs about anything having to do with  red baron d or any of its many mods and patcheshere is a good place to start if you are ready to take the plungered baron d is one of the best wwi flight simulator
its beath taking graphics and great gameplay mix into one
good luck on your travelsdiablo is one of my all time favorite games this expansion adds the monk and the barbarian if you know how and also adds the hive and the crypt levels and tons of stuff and spells
also it allows you to run in town sounds like not much but that is a big deal to mei have been playing this game since i was a kid and still play it today
its an amazing game and would highly recommend it to any pilotits very entertaining
the missions are pretty cool
this is a huge game
the online component makes it a blastthis is one of the best games ive ever played
you can go mad in the streets of chicago unlock new cars by winning races just cruise around testing your vehicle download more cars off the internet including farrari f ellinor from gone in  seconds aeroplane ford excursion chevorlet suburban lego car and many more with lots being created every two or three days
this is the best game for driving like a blind manmidtown madness is the only software title ive ever purchased that keeps  me and my son going back for more and more and more for almost two years  straight
its also the only title i will never uninstall
a metal goes  to the genious at angel studios for coming to the obvious conclusion that  driving in circles is a drag but having free high octane access to the  streets of americas greatest city chicago would be a blast and midtown  madness is simply that blowing away every other racing title off the road
and a big high five and kudos to microsoft for putting it in the box so i  could buy it
why
because it has been brilliantly injected with a mondo  dose of what every red blooded american driver wants freedom
pile drive  your way down side streets alleys or lakeshore drive at  mph plus  during rush hour
destroy every mail box phone booth and street sign it  sight all the while driving poor unsuspecting citizens from the sidewalk  just to listen to them scream
theres no blood no death no four letter  words or flying middle fingers just pure unrestrained fun everytime you get  behind the wheel of a wide range of four wheelers like a caddy bug semi  city bus or mustang just to name a few
it ran great when all i had was  an ati mb video board my system is pii mhz but now that ive  upgraded to an ati mb board the visual madness is nearly lethal
and  when ive got a half dozen of chicagos finest flashing those pretty reds  in my rearview mirror doing everything in their power to ram me off the  busy city streets i just know ill be spending the night in cyber jail for  any number of serious moving violations and isnt that what its all  aboutthis game is fantasticand not to expensive
it has excellent great looking graphicswhich are better than the game driver
choose from different vehicleschoose whether you want more cops or lessthe weatherand how much traffic on the road
it is great for just taking a drive on the roadi love it
or great for just a spinthis game believe it or not is better than midtown which supposed to be even more exciting than this
midtown hasnt got realism nor excitement but this game has both although is not the newer version
the cars are perfectly detailed with their real average speed meter and control
the pedestrians in the game are sometimes business men or tourists
they walk around streets and cross the road sometimes just like real life
and when you think you can kill them they jump away from you
midtown madness also downloaded meigs field airport with planes landing and taking off
and when speeding up your car the cops follow you
you can sometimes get away from the cops as quickly as you can and not let them track you
you could also make the cops crash into other cars
all of this is part of the realism and excitement in the game
the other part also includes traffic lights
if youre interested into cruising around and obeying the law one way of proving that is to stop your car running while theres a red light
also you could always control life at chicago
before you cruise in chicago go to the main menu and there you can change the population and traffic in the game
you can reduce the pedistrian density and the traffic density aswell
and dont forget you could also reduce the cop density aswell
proving this game could get more realistic you could put in city sounds instead of music while driving
or you could increase the detail in the game by going to the graphics option
do not even forget every time you cruise around the music changes
and that my friends would not make you bored
when youre tired of cruising around you could always win races to unlock special cars
or you could also go to multiplayer and play cops vs robbers match
i could go on and on but id better leave you here
and remember its up to you to buy this game
but my advice is to buy ityou want to experience driving in the opposite direction in a highway
do you want to beat the red light in a busy street
do you want police cars chasing you as you dodge and turn every corner in a busy intersection
well then grab this game
forget about car physics with this game though  because the designers completely threw the laws of physics out the window
however prepare to have the the best car ride ever
you drive in chicago  with a good choice of cars and a bus to boot
you can either race or just  casually drive the streets of the citygraphics are beautiful and  welldetailed
sound is not that great though
gameplay rocks
i mean  things you cant do in a real street you can do it here in this game and  its almost as real as it gets
ai is kinda weak
they keep hitting each  other in an intersection
i hope they come out with a new york city  edition
all in all if youre after just the adrenaline rush of driving in  a city then pick up this game
this game is best played with a microsoft  forcefeedback steering wheelage of empires in my view is a perfect strategy game
what else can you  expect from the creators of dos windows    and  that would  be microsoft of course ok well start with the playabilty
i dont  think theres any game or series i have played more than aoe
the  possibilites are endless what about a deathmatch with victory conditions  set to conquest for a huge game
add a little twist pick large islands  for your map type and barricade your island by building watch towers and a  wall all around it
oh and then build up a mighty fleet of juggernauts  ships and attack by sea
or how about choosing eight player mode and  allying with a few of them then unselecting the fixed positions option and  placing your civilization next to your allies
for a touch of reality why  not play persians versus greeks
i could go on foreverthen we have  graphics and audio
the graphics are beautiful the objects are solid so  you dont get that annoying quotsoldier walking right through treequot  effect
this game is not new so thats quite an achievement
the colors are  bright not dull or depressing
audio well could be better
the units  vocabulary is limited to gibberish like quothamasquot and  quothoyoquot
but i guess thats because theyre prehistoric and dont  have languages
aoe  fixes that problem with real phrases from over a  dozen languages
repetitive backround music plays continuouslywhat  else
as it is not new it runs perfectly without dfx and a pentium   pc is more than enough
a fast cd rom is personally recommended because it  used to freeze up for a couple of seconds occasionallyas for the cons  id have to say the population limit
the limited audio
the initial  difficulty of moving through the agesthats it
get this game if you  like strategyall these simulator games continue to come out but only one will remain less complicated
i called that age of empires
dont know anything about the past of conquering and empires
easy then
all you have to do for one easy game is attack the greek if your the egyptians and take over there government
usually it is supposed to take a while and if you gain more points then the greek youll be fine
also you can play with a friend or with someone you dont know by using zonecom from msn aka microsoft
you can also do campaigns
another thing you can do is be the persians mongols chinese greek egyptian korean even more or just create your own tribe and call it anything you want
the game isnt tough and for people like me who like the conquering age youll like this game
isnt like civilization and casear games which are complicated
so go ahead and buy age of empires todaywarning age of mythology is pretty useless
the gods make no sense
most of the game is made up rather than age of empires
try the expansion packs if you want more action from a game maker like microsoft gamesage of empires is a classic strategy game
it was one of the first id ever bought and i got hooked
i have played every possible scenario and made a hundred scenarios myselfeverything about this game is brilliant  the campaigns are great the random map is cool but my absolute favourite part of the game is the death match  i love how you get  wood gold stone and food it means you dont need to gather supplies you just can get right into building up your armymy favourite thing to do in any match is kill off the enemy
i just love destroying everything
im not happy unless everything is destroyedi like playing multiplayer and making my own scenarios its a laugh writing in the instructions and hints etc but it gets kind of boring after awhile
but this doesnt draw away from the game itselfi love all the units all the buildings and im in love with the music
the soundtrack to this game is amazing
i love to use cheats i get off the net it makes the game even more funoverall a classic game that every strategy game enthusiast needs to play or own at one stagethis one game represents the way pc is so incredible
this came out a  while ago and it still is one of my favorites
i find it challenging
microsoft gaming zone is getting really great too so you dont have to  worry about it being to complex
you will become hooked and be a quick real  time strategy fan
this one is an upallnighter for you gamers
if you are  into rts or no get this gamethis game is absolutely wonderful
i cant think of how anyone could make another game of the same genre that would rival it
you begin way back at the dawn of man
you have just villagers amp clubmen
from there you  size up amp use your assets to your best advantage  villagers can chop  wood for houses amp buildings mine gold for  mine stone for lookout  towers fish hunt build stuff andoh mythe strategy of this game is  what makes it so intoxicatingly good
this is not a game where you can  just go out play it a couple times amp have it completely mastered
you  must learn how to use your assets to your best advantage amp how to  defend your villages against invasion
otherwise you will be destroyedwith every mission comes new technology
you can build heavy infranty  units calvary naval armadas war elephants catapults priestsand the  list goes on and on
the gold edition also has the roman empire scenarios  which offer a few more neat tidbits such as camel riders and fire galleys
the only slight precaution i would have for anyone is to stay away from  making stone throwers on the rome version
they are next to  uselesseven when you have gone thru all the scenarios for this game  youre still not done
you can have random scenarios constructed for you  by the computer and then there are the death matches impossible if you  pick   armies against you
you can also play the game online against  friends at the website although you need a fast modem for this
the fun  goes on amp onso if you like strategy games this is one of the  very best hands down
build cities make them into empires and conquer  all the known world
i cant recommend this game highly enoughi love how cheap games become when theyre outdated esp
when the expansion pack comes with it
this game is worth more than what youre paying imo
tons of maps scenerios campaigns creating your own
you have lots of cheats but after  straight weeks of playing your skills will bump up high enough that youll never need to use them unless youre in a mustwin bad mood
the  fun chats are for the priests  chariot archers that give them sonic speed adding humor to the game  giving you a speed advantage durring wars
 nothing vents off realworld anger like declaring war  fighting it in a game
when youre done if you winyoull feel refreshed  happy with only cramped fingers as a casualtythis game is as good today as it was when i first played it long agoi have a higher end system and there is no problem running it
i think it must be the cheat codes built into the games
but it is still fun to play
so after a grueling day and i want to blow things up i play ages of empires rise of romei was glad to see it at amazon
and couldnt wait to get it backthis was really my introduction into the strategy genre and i loved it
regardless to say i really dont think the expansion pack rise of rome is all that spectacular
the expansion pack i felt featured some useless  units camel scythe chariots armored elephant nothing that could really  significantly boost gameplay
the new techs didnt help either and their  wasnt a fix to computers or anything like that but dont let this  discourage you
age of empires really was what not only got me into  strategy games but into ancient history as a whole
the guys at es  ensemble studios did a great job with the history throughout gameplay
age of empires has some great features including  chariot archers  which are probably the most overused unit although thats not a bad  thing
 it also has the internet gameplay feature which is really what  sold this game for me
 lastly not only does it have good graphics for  the picky i can say at least for  but it has the excellent ability to  play the dms deatmatches and to make your own scenariosreal fun game with d movement and strategy
soundtrack by yes and very good visuals for a game this old
i bought a new copy of homeworld  the old one was scratched loaded it and no lucknothing worked compatibility as admin nothing and little online about a fix
so i thought what the heck see if h will play
sure did
loaded fast with my i  and plays real smooth
i set the graphics so high it slowed me down trying to read the fine print on selected units and mouse over ids
h played on my vista but h was buggy but did play
opposite now and h plays like a dream
still looks good for its age and still a a lot of fun
still looks good period
save a good  bucks and buy a sure fire winner like thishad  copies throughout the years
going to baby this one for sure
thanks windows for killing another favorite game of mine h
i did notice the original halo sure does boot up fine on all win releases
stoopid monkeyi bought homeworld when it was first released in  when i first played the game my reaction was the same as that of many others who have posted their reviews  the interface was difficult to master the missions were too difficult
eventually i gave up and put homeworld back onto the shelf
its now  and homeworld has built up a huge following on the internet
so i reinstalled the game on my computerand got a major surprisethe first time round id seen this games flaws
it does have a difficult to master interface
its missions are very difficult to play  especially those set in the garden of kadesh nebula missions   
the big difference is that there are many surefire strategies posted on the internet that can assist you in getting past the more difficult missionsonce youve gotten used to the interface and the totally new mindboggling environment of real d space homeworld is a surprisingly enjoyable game
the graphics are what draw you in first
two years after it was first produced and i find the graphics to be totally entrancing
im not sure whether even new games like sacrifice or giants citizen kabuto can surpass itat least not without upgrading your pc to a ghz cpulike the command amp conquer games you have to harvest resources and build a massive army
but there are two big differences  the space fleet you build in one mission is carried over into the next mission
i enjoy this aspect of the game  theres a deep sense of satisfaction when you see the massive fleet of  ioncannon frigates  destroyers and  heavy cruisers you just builtthe second major difference is that you can capture other spaceships and add them to your fleet
annoyed with those pesky multi ionbeam frigates attacking your mothership
just send a squadron of salvage corvettes after them and capture the entire fleet
this is definitely one of the most important aspects of playing homeworld  learning how to sneak a squad of salvage corvettes towards an enemy fleetthe story isnt terribly original
what is original is the style in which it is presented
this is no slick hollywoodproduced motionpicture like tiberian sun or red alert  the production style is much closer to a paredback japanese anime
to be honest despite the comparisons to star wars or star trek homeworld is a much closer relation to star blazers robotech or macross
especially when you have spaceships like the heavy cruiser a very close relation to robotechs sdf or the destroyer star blazers fans will love the wavemotion gun effects from its ioncannons
in conclusion i strongly recommend homeworld to strategy gamers with an open mind
when it was first released very few people had the pcs with sufficient processing power to play this game
now
if you have anything faster than a pentium iii mhz then i cant recommend this game highly enough
it is a classic that youll be hooked on and playing years from now
just buy this game
you wont regret itsame applies as cataclysm max rating to any homeworld game
loved this series when i was young had to own copies again
cant complain about quality as per its age but in its day it was groundbreaking gameplay
to this day no other game has matched its gameplay style effectively or been able to be as fluid
graphically it was also impressive for its timethe greatest computer game i have ever played has been changed to homeworld
i do not know how they pulled this off but the first successful venue of taking realtime strategy rts to d is an astounding success
perfect interface lush graphics and killer multiplayer
complaints the single player game is kinda short but there are expansion  packs on the waythe only problem i have is that its too difficult
im not sure if its adaptive
im getting clobbered
kinda reminds me of playing chess against the computerso after the attack is in full force i frequently find myself turning the game off
why am i putting myself through this
why is getting attacked by an armada fun 
let me go read a walkthrough pros great single player storyline and plot with good cinimatics in between missions most missions are well thought out and unpredictable optional great graphics on powerful computers optional great performance on slower computers included multiplayer system works well and is free
usually not to busy but there are always at least  people on
usually over 
 build many kinds of ships each having their own strenths and abilities d enviorment is well designed and easy to manuver through use different formations attack setting grouping etc
to make the most out of your attacks good sound effects and musiccons harvesting system isnt the best ever but works well on a good map included map editor unreliable and hard to use focusing to close on a battle causes incredible lag esspecially durring internet gameplay the  different races almost exactly alike gravity well generators piss me off youll know what im talking about when you start playing this game online
 more ships would be nice my title pretty much sums it up
if youre like me youve come from a gaming community who fell in love with warcraft ii amp starcraft but  slowly grew tired of the rts realtime strategy clones that have followed  ever since then
and you think quotno one can do it better than blizzard  did back thenquotand for the most part you would be right
but  whats this sierra is claiming with homeworld
a dimensional rts
quothows that possiblequot you ask
well i asked the same thing and  plopped my money down after a while since i was doubtful but all my  reservations were quickly put to rest
amazingly it works
a true d rts  on your flat d screen
sierra did it and they did it welland they  didnt stop there
they took the time to make the sound and music great
but they didnt stop there either
its the graphics which are the cherry  on top
it is simply beautiful
ive only played this game on my voodoo   graphics card so i dont know what it looks like without a good graphics  card but you still wont be disappointed
homeworld is a great game and  easily deserves all the awards it receivedother things to note it is  not d in the sense you have completely unlimited height width and depth
height is somewhat restricted like any gameboard but not enough to hurt  the game and certainly enough to give it the d effect you really will  get
and you may find yourself getting tired of the rts resource gather  fight cycle as you inevitably do with other rtss where tactics dont play  as much a role as youd like
in which case in all honestly the demo may  be enough for you so download and try that firstyoull love itif  nothing else can be said about it this can its a fresh approach on a  genre that was being overdone and youll get that initial quotwarcraft  ii thrillquot you first did when you played it back in  which i  honestly hadnt had since then but was glad to have it for a while again  with this gameall right home world is about a quest to find your home planet id tell you more but i would end up giving it all away but what i can tell you is that you can research build and capture ships which makes it really awsomei got this a long time ago but i think that it is so awsome that i still play it trust me youll love this gamehomeworlds best featuresgraphics engine scripting control mechanics narrative flow and mission structure are so fluid so highly immersive that it makes the experience far more than the sum of its parts
the  combination of large scale fleet actions and cinematic perspectives creates  the most impressive space combat ever made for a strategy game
its like  being in the middle of and in cotrol of a star wars battle
 single  player missions can make for some short gaming time but most people go  through the campaign at least twiceits that good
in single player youll  encounter  races aside from the  main one that your trying to  decimatethere are  units to choose from on each side with  main  classes of shipsfrom the paltry fire of the scout to the amazing might of  the heavy cruiser
the excellent use of d makes for some interesting  strategies putting much imphasis on the element of surpriseto sum it  up buy homeworld for its engrossing realtimestrategy matched to a vital  and visually intense story making this a gaming experience like none  otherps
you may want to check the relic and sierra message boards to  see what other people think of the gameplus it could help you along in  learning the basic components of the gamewhat can one say when a game sucks you in so completely that time seems to collapse in on itself and become meaningless
homeworld is one those rare games that is so solid that it really evolves as you play it
it does this  by providing the player with a rocksolid background story backed up by  superior game play
i highly reccommend that players read the manual before  playing because it gives you a tremendous amount of race history that  builds up the mystique for the race that you become responsible for
gameplay is relatively easy to master and the learning curve is pretty  flat
it takes some getting used to the d battle field and selecting ships  to attack and the fact that you cannot pause the action to assign targets  to attack is annoying but beyond that if you practice you will get the  hang of it quickly
i say visual and aural feast because it is
the  ship design is excellent reminescent of babylon  and dream pod s mekton  sourcebooks for the jovian chronicles rpgs
the music is both subtle and  awe inspiring at the same time with its majestic and powerful choral  accompaniments that tug at your emotions as sure as the importance of  seeing the mothership and her precious cargo safely to the homeworld
if youve come here to expect blood splattering on walls or pouring out  windows inconveniencing passersby with the spray you will be  disappointed
this game is not extreme nor does it kick ss instead it  inspires and propagates a whole host of emotions bordering on an intensity  rarely seen in a game before
the story is equal to that of such epics  as starcraft amp broodwar and dark forces ii jedi knight i know its  an fps and not an rts but im talking about story not game type
it makes  getting the mothership home an imperative and not just a reason to see the  end cut scene
additionally yes has performed the title track for the  game and itself is a nine minute epic as is most of yes music that  compliments the game
when a supergroup like yes pays attention to a video  game it must be something special
homeworld is for anyone who loves  science fiction and good gaming all rolled into onehomeworld deserves every bit of the game of the year accoladei have never seen such a breathtaking and stunning gamepiece of entertainment before and i seriously doubt something like this will surface again the  next few decadesis homeworld the best game ever made
that is a tough  decission but it sure comes pretty damn closeanyway the  gameexperience should be a musthave for anybody interested in a  completely controlable d universe science fiction tactics space  simulations strategy and an extraordinary experiencean old gaming buddy of mine stoogebaal introduced me to homeworld and when i first played it i had some misgivings about the game it was a resource hog for the time it came out which made my system drop out and glitch every now and then the missions were limited in terms of scope
the game itself was so immaginative and impressive that i think some attention was lacking in designing the missions
theyre impressive but couldve been so much more i couldnt pilot a single ship
i was delegated strictly to the role of admiralfleetcaptain
i couldnt jump into the cockpit or bridge of one of these ships and take a hands on approach to fightingergo my following thoughts there are so many positives about this game that i cant help but give it five stars
however if i were to make a mod or have the developers create an expansion for homeworld it would be to create a realism mode where players could fight over vast distances
im talking millions of kilometers here au size strategic ranges with perhaps tactical distances being more akin to modern bvr engagement for todays jet fighters
i also would love to be able to have been able to pilot one of the ships andor man a gun turret while my ai controlled the rest of my assetsotherwise in terms of graphics this game is visually striking
and i truly mean that
vivendi did their homework when it came to developing this game and it was created with love and passion for the science fiction space opera genrethe music story and backgrounds are blended supurbly
this is truly an impressive production but like i say i had my own personal misgivings of what i wanted
still my personal tastes shouldnt detract from what surely is quality game designlike i say those are just my personal takes on what else i would have liked in this this game
i know its been about ten years since this game first came out and seeing as how the whole franchise seems to have been put permanently on hiatus the possibility of this series being revived are slim and none
too bad because it deserves betterhomeworld is the spacegame other corporate driven studios would have loved to have produced but because of their own power structures dictating their creativity cant
theyre incapable of doing so and when they tried tended to botch the effortif you havent tried homeworld then do yourself a favor and buy a used copy
every good science fiction fan owes it to themselves
the missions are somewhat linear and lack what could have been a larger dynamicism but the gameplay is respectable enough that you should be able to enjoy the story and wonderful graphics that rival todays top of the line spacesimsi havent even finished it yet its been ages since i started but this game is wonderful the ship designs the fulld perspective and the interface all work together to create an incredible game
the ingame music  is hauntingly wonderful as wellwe all know about realtime strategy rts games
we all remember that comand and conquer and warcraft were the first providing the giant shoulders that countless game developers would stand on in an attempt to cash in on the latest gaming fad
a few standout rts were developed in the  wake of warcraft but not manyenter homeworld
from the moment you  enter the tutorial it is blindingly obvious that this game will be like  none you have ever played
you manage your units in true d space using a  brilliant combo of mouse actions and hotkeys to position the camera group  and move units and more and while awkward at first the system becomes  second nature after a short whilethe graphics are indeed stunning but  the beauty of homeworld is gameplay
in a day when most rts are rehashed  warcraft or campc relic has created a game that truly feels like its  happening in space
epic starship battles happen at your fingertips and  brilliant ingame cutscenes and plot twists help move the game along  without a break in the immersion
this game was so awesome i was too  intimidated to play it when i first got it
ladies and gentlemen we have  a winnerbored of the same ol rts
get homeworld
just do it
trust  mespectacular
this is easily one of the best games i have ever played
the graphics are wonderful and the ease of scrolling and views you can take are second to none
some rts games such as far gate star trek space armada and empire earth slow up to be impossible to play when you have a lot of units in play but with homeworld this is not a problem
game creaters could learn a lot from thisa great feature is the amount of space warfare you get to do
i love that
as i was going through the game i started to feel a bit as though the missions were a little too easy as i was using the same strategy for aboutt hree of them with success but i realised that i has spoken too soon
i am right on the last part of the game now and i am finding it impossible to beat
i cant believe that after only just managing to beat one wave of ships another one appears immediately with the same fire poweri havent had any problems with the inteface
i find its complexity adds to the realism of the gameexcept maybe ctp ii just around the corner
activision managed to include enough game details to keep it interesting
the game excels in span of years
you play over  years  great graphics
 average diplomacy  features
 superb stealth units like spy lawyer corporate branch that  can be used to dominate your opponents without military battles
 broad  range of inventions and wonders of the world that you can create to earn  extra pointsfinally someone has the proper equation figured outthe civilization collection is one of the best of all time
this has the same idea as civ  and family but has a diffrent game play
the game has changes in three major ways   you now use the mouse alot more instead of  the keyboard
 instead of seattlers to build roads you now use public  works or pw
i like this idea of the game better
 you can now bombard  units
you basically attack them without attempting to take over their  square
this is one of my favorite additions
the diplomatic options are  better and you can build more units and improvements
i would highly  recommend to anyone anyone who likes straitgy gamesthis is a collection of the first  kings quest game covering a history going back to the mids
therefore the earliest of these games are quite primative but have a nostalgic charm to them and all the games have fun fantasy stories with a wonderful light sense of humourwhen the first kings quest came out it was at the vanguard of game design
unlike the text adventure games common at the time some of which had a few static graphics here you could see your character moving around an actual environment and interacting with objects
the games themselves are quite simple basically they are just treasure hunts where you have to find the right object and take it back to the correct character to trade for another object etc
but charming
the interface on these earliest games are parser as opposed to point and click meaning with the exception of movement by cursor keys you have to type in commands in order to tell the character what to do
this had its disadvantages at times you know what to do but not how to say it but it also had its advantages there was less room for guessing by just clicking your inventory objects on the hotspot one at a timein kq and  the puzzles are mainly based on remembering rhymes and fairy tales eg you know little red riding hood needs a basket to take to her grandmas house but with kq  the storylines start to become more complex and original and interesting and actual problem solving starts to come into play
and with kq the graphics start to become more artistic although still primitive by todays standardskq is the first one with a pointandclick interface and suffers from the problem that it is easy to solve puzzles by just clicking inventory items at random instead of by thinking and many of the puzzles are obvious at any rate especially when you find the right object but the enjoyable storyline makes up for this
kq designed with the help of gabriel knights jane jensen is clearly the best storywise and has some challenging puzzles save often to avoid frustration
kq the first designed for release exclusively on cdrom has the best graphics of the series even better than the d crap in  and includes a world straight out of a tim burton movie that is especially fun to explore but is geared towards a younger audience even then i enjoyed the story and interesting puzzles with multiple solutions
unlike lucasfilm games the characters in kq can die and if this happens you have to restart from a saved game but it is sometimes fun to see how many different ways they can die for  it is the most entertaining part of the gameincluded is the newer version of mixed up mother goose where young players help to recreate mother goose rhymes by reuniting characters with lost objects no death in this one
the original mumg had a certain charm but only toddlers will fail to find this one annoying
also included are both laura bow mysteries about a girl detective in the s which are fun to play but are convoluted and very frustrating to solve especially since they are in real time so while you observe something important in one room you often miss something else important in another room
several text games that came out prekq are also included which will help newer players understand why kq was so revolutionarymost of these games would no longer be worthwhile on their own except as nostalgia kq and  and maybe  being the exceptions but as one package this is a wonderful buy and leaves one hoping that a kq will come out and repair the damage caused by that travesty kqthis is truly a remarkable collection and a great buy
but the best game herein in my opinion is quotthe colonels bequestquot
thats the only reason why i got this collectionif youre an alfred hitchcock fan  youll love this game
its very reminiscent of the movies  quotpsychoquot theres even a funny shower scene as a tribute and  quotropequot
set in the swamps of louisiana in  a young college  girl accompanies her friend to the friends family reunion on a secluded  rundown civil war plantation
after the head of the family tells his  relatives and servants that his wealth will be ditributed to them equally  when he dies murder and mayhem soon follow
as an earlier reviewer  stated this game is great for a cold dark night
many details and  occurrences of this game are exciting and haunting from the ghost of a  teenage girl in the cemetery and the discovery of the family bible in the  chapel to the stories celie former plantation slave tells you of how it  was in the old days and the notes and letters left behind by the original  land owners who saw that their end was near referring to the spread of the  civil war
this game is full of mystery and suspense
despite its aged  ega graphics and typing interface it will still captivate any gamer who  has a hunger for suspense
regardless of how much graphics video and  sound improves this reamins my alltime favorite gamefor those of you criticizing the prices here on amazon for this amazing collection i find it kind of funny
most of you myself included have no problem plopping down  bucks for a new game but when it comes to the greatest collection of games ever released including the first  kings quest games and a remake of the first   with better graphics only available in this collection  as well as a host of other classic adventure games and other bonuses to numerous to list  bucks or so starts to sound like a bargain  and believe me you probably wont save any money on ebay on this one  hard to find is a gross understatement
supply and demandi have my copy and i love itok i was very surprised when i got this
i used to have laura bow  which is an awesome detective game but i lost it
so i saw that it was in this collection so i payed for it alone because it is worth it
then after i got this collection and played lb awhile i decided to try kings quest
the first game is awesome even with the bit graphics
i still havent beaten them all
i beat kq  and  this collection also made me go out and buy kings quest  which is a new gameoverall this collection is worth ten time what you pay for
you get like  full games
buy this as soon as you cana fun role playing game at which when i play i can lose myself in the world of uraki would recomend the game to anyone over the age of the first thing that catches you about lords of magic is the music
there were a number of times id pause the game at night and leave it on just to have the music playing in the background as i slept
yes the soundtrack is that good
once youve digested that the ease of gameplay becomes loms most attractive and important feature
lom is one of the games that lifted battle control from the old darklands model and rightly so theres a reason darklands still has a core of followers after almost eight years on the market
the maps are gorgeous the sound even better the game easy to play and engaging
the only drawback is that the voices get repetitive at times but the developers thankfully included an option to turn them off
few games are this good at what they do and deliver what they do as simply and attractivelythe title says it all
this game has a feel of magical and fantastical proportions
from the graphics to the music to the units
everything lends to an atmosphere unrivaled in any other gamethe strategic aspects of the game are not great but the tactical combat is excellent
battles can be hard until you learn a few tricks such as using parrying warriors as decoys or flying missile unitsthe best part about the special editionthe only one you can get though are the epic quests
they are truly epic with two that are really really epic
my favorite is the good old fashioned arthur quest
you get to play as arthur merlin lancelot and the rest of gang through a story derived from sir thomas malorys version of the arthurian legendall in all this game is worth every penny you spend on itthe one thing you need to know about this game right away is that it will pulverize you with some frequency
if you are not a patient gamer this game is probably not for you because chances are you will need multiple playthroughs before you are able to beat it for the first timethat being said if you are the type that enjoys a good challenge and doesnt mind the ai kicking you in the pants periodically then by all means get this game
it is one of those classics from the golden age of gaming that most people have overlooked and is worthy of any strategy fans collectionthe game actually takes place on two levels the first is the strategic map which is turn based and is where you recruit units gather resources explore and build your empire
the next level is the tactical battlefield where your forces battle in real time engagements
of the two the second is by far the most fun as the first is very slow going even if you have multiple scout units running aroundpossibly one of the best parts of the game is the other factions and how they react to you
each faction can be dealt with in different ways
you can ally with them and eventually absorb them into your empire
you can conquer them and take their lands by force or you can just leave them alone and let them do their own thing
just dont expect them to leave you alone forever theyre trying to win the game toothe graphics and sound effects are of course dated but for their time period theyre very well done and despite their age i actually found that i enjoyed the look and feel of it all
the strategic map is vast and diverse and while the tactical arenas are more or less cut and paste i never felt like i was fighting on the exact same battlefield against the exact same opponentso if you dont mind dated graphics and sfx and are up for a challenge then i would say get this game and have a blast
a final warning guard your hero well anything happens to himher youll find yourself starting over in a hurryi cant stop playing
i rediscovered this game after running into a mod site got google
keyword mantera gs impz xorgate lomse and downloaded the mod and more importantly modification tools that allows access to the games engine to edit spells units artifacts and other aspects of the games enginefundamentally the game is still the same with that unique ability to barter and beg   wildcats for   xena  from other more clever ai players that makes it so unique among these types of games
however the mod and you need to get this game if only to check out the mod and aforementioned mod tools changes things in such a way to correct bugs left over from the final special edition release and the later lomseexe beta patch and added a few extras such as ai security for capitol and the templeeven without the mod this game is slamming
load times for dungeons and encounters are quick on the xp pentium s and though the mouse moves way to fast for overland and combat scroll the keyboard arrow keys work just fineafter  years lords of magic did not get older it got betterupdate a fan finished the game with release of a  patch that corrects some problems from the earlier released  beta patch use keyword search as described above to find both patchesthis is the ultimate version of simcity
the newer version has more bells and whistles but the game is essentially the same
plus the new version is a memoryresource hog
in this version the urban renewal kit is the  best part of the game
its great to play together with kids     making it a good family game also
if you like thought provoking fun and  educational games this one is a winnersim city  is a great game for anyone who wants a challenge and of course a ton of fun
in this game you are the mayor and you control the fate of your city
you build the roads power plants and other special buildings do the zoning and let the sims do the rest
however disasters do happen
so be on the alert
tornadoes earthquakes and much more can decimate your city
here are some helpful hints and secrets for you when building roads make the area within them x
sims like to be three spaces or less away from roads on all sides of them when zoning put industrial at least three spaces away from residencial
hey would you like living nextdoor to a noisy smelly smokey factory
well i sure wouldnt
 if you dont want disasters to happen to your city simply click on the disasters bar at the top of the screen and select no disasters
 finally if you want to know the ultimate code then hear this all you have to do is type in the letters imacheatthis game is good at first
its also very challenging
but after you have played it for a while it tends to get really boringhowever if you like games by maxis then this is a mustsee
maxis makes great games  that are written very welli just picked this limited edition boxset  and definantely am thankful i did
if you can find it somewhere grab itgk games did for mystery games what command and conquer did for realtime strategies
add the supernatural element and you got two great classics
the soundtrack cd that comes packaged is worth the price alone as robert holmes composes some of the most beautifully eerie musicif you see this le boxset snatch it upgabriel knight wants to be a slacker and a writerit turns out he has a destiny instead one that sends him tracking down voodoo priestesses and werewolves on a regular basisthe first gabriel knight game had an  excellent story and cool characters even if they were just little sprites  running around
the beast within the second game really came alive with  superb use of fmv and excellent casting for everyone except gabriel but  the rest are so good and even he shines sometimes that you dont mind too  much
plus the story is rich and complex drawing from reality and  fiction equally and blending them so skillfully you arent sure whats  quotrealquot and what isnt by the time youre doneand the  musicwow
im not even referring to the opera they wrotethe score for  the game itself had me on the edge of my seat more than once
you owe it  to yourself to play these games nowi only recently discovered gabriel knight and immideately became hooked on the series
they involve very real feeling characters historical facts  tweaked juuust enough to make a mystery and environments to explore that  leave you with just the right feeling of creepynessthe first game is a  bit old but the graphics are still wonderful and the storyline is great
the voice acting is top notch as well featuring a cast that includes tim  curry and mark hammill  the setting is new orleans and you play the role  of gabriel knight a struggling southern man who owns a failing bookstore  and who dreams of writing murdermystery novelshe follows a series of  odd mutulation murders that have voodoo undertones to them to research the  novel hes trying to write  and is inadvertantly plunged into a side of  reality that he didnt know existed and learns of his familys heritage  steeped in fighting such darknessthe second game is a cinema quality  live action game with actors
i was highly impressed at the acting skills  sierra had managed to recruit and how involved the gameplay waswhile  the first game focused on new orleans the second takes place in germany as  gabriel is called upon his first true role as a shattenger shadow hunter  to deal with a werewolf that has been mauling people on the edges of town
you take up the role of gabriel again as he explores the streets of  germany and his assistant grace who follows after him and tries to track  him downone word of warning although there is no blatant nudity there  is blood profanity and some implied sexuality
this isnt a game for the  kiddiesneither of these games are quickie things that could be finished  in one evening
they both promise long gameplay and good replayability
as an added bonus the novel gives you an insight on the characters that the  games cant
i highly reccomend purchasing this package especually if  youre a diehard adventure gamerits been a long time since ive played this gamefinding this on amazon was a thrill
it brought back many happy memories
back then i had experienced a crash somewhere around day  for gabriel knight  so i have not completed either game
both games are extremely fun and somewhat educational
you tend to learn things about voodoo and werewolvesthe second gabriel knight is more like an interactive movie and of course the graphics are a lot better
and ole gabes assistance grace plays more of a role in the second one as wellby doing a little research i found out that playing both games on a modern windows platform is possible
youll need a dos programi dont know what it is about this game but its one of my top favorite video games
this may not be for everyone though
those that like the shoot em up car chasing type of games should look elsewhere
but for a rainy day or just looking for something to do then this game is for youwhat can i say
the gabriel knight series is to traditional rd person adventure what the myst series is to atmospheric st person adventure  the best of its kind
briefly put they follow the adventures and experiences of author and bookstore owner gabriel knight as he unravels various occult mysteries and at the same time explores his odd heritagethe stories are incredibly engaging and well developed  the author jane jensen put a remarkable amount of research into the subject matter
the characters are likable and believable and the voice acting  and in gk the acting  is some of the best
everything about these games is excellently donefor the collector the gk series is a little history of the adventure genre
gk is made with the d animation typical of the early s while gk explores the fmv trend popular in the middle of the decade
in both the main action consists of finding and applying inventory items and gathering information by talking to a wide range of characters with a spattering of arcade type puzzles and brain teasers to keep things interesting
one feature that i liked was that you are awarded points for completing puzzles but you dont have to complete every puzzle to complete the game
this makes the games highly replayable as you can play through once for the bones of the story and then play again to go back and pick up what you might have missed the first time
there are also a lot of fun easter eggs that you can stumble on by chancethough the subject matter is sometimes grim dealing with murders conspiracies and such occult subjects as voodoo and werewolves there is a levening of humour in the character interactions that keeps the darkness at bayi found these games totally absorbing it was not unusual to play for    hours at a stretch without even realising it
they are also very long  a plus as far as im concerned  taking a week to ten days to complete
you can be killed but it happens rarely and when it does you are given the option to try again from a point right before you made your fatal mistake so if you havent saved recently it isnt such a big dealdie hard fans of first person mystlike adventures may have a hard time relating to the gabriel knight series because its so different and players of shooters or pure action games will probably not like gk at all
if you like games like the longest journey however you will like thesethe collectors edition pack contains a lot of extras  books soundtracks and the like
thats a plus and well worth having because i was so sorry when the games were over that i wanted to keep reliving the experience again and again
id pay twice the price just to have one of these games
they truly are the besti really enjoy this game
there are seven fractions that all broke up when they landed on the planet
you must choose to represent one
there are several changes that this game made along with improvement a
there  is now a concel that all the countries make up
when issues arive they all  go to meet on the issue
you can run for planetary governew where you are  essianly the leader of union
i really enjoy this and it opens up the  option for a diplomatic victory
b
you now have boarders
this is  simple where your city limits are
an improvement for a possible ac would  be that you can move the boarders by notation and not but building a citythe one thing i did not like about this game was the tech tree
i never  felt like i was in charge
only having seven diffrent fractions  countries may seem like a down fall but if you stick with one fraction  you will become bitter rivals with other fractionsi would highly  recommend this game
there is the enivitable question of wiether it is  better than civ
that of course is tough compition but considering that  civ came out a few years ago ac was able to update some parts
i think ac  has a slight egde but civ was more impressive for its timealpha centauri is perhaps one of the best strategy games ever
i really like the way you can change your environment with the formers
i usually create rover formers and run with those
theyre the same as rovers only can move  squares instead of the usual one so you do more faster
i start at the edge of my continent and continuously raise terrain adding new area that i can plant colony pods on
simple by todays standards but i just cant stop playing iti have played many types of civilization type games  from the original civilization to the current civilization iii and everything in betweenbut i keep getting drawn back to the fantastic alpha centauri by sid meier and company
although sort of a sequel to meiers highly popular civilization ii it is just different enough to be easily the best civilization type computer game currently availablefrom its highly interesting beginning at the start of the colonization of a totally alien world you can take your choice of factions to total transcendence  going beyond humanity and almost becoming a god
there are more different ways to play this game then there is space to review it
do you want to try you luck as the scientist and research your way to the top
or do you want to have peace with the peacekeepers
or do you want to conquer the world with a religious fervor
these are just a couple of the great factions available during game playthe interface is one of the better ones available and allows you to choose from many options which will help you when saving and playing the game
turning on and off the sound the secret project movies and custom tailoring the game to what you want it to display is fairly easy
theres even an quotautosavequot feature which is a nice touch if you need to break away form your game quickly
there are still many people that play and use this game online and the online interface is just as easy to use as the rest of the gamethe science fiction setting gives a totally new way to look at a colonization game
although some fans of sims might find the units and their names a little strange you can and you will get into designing your own military might quickly
the unit design feature is a nice touch  it allows you to create a unit with exactly the type of weapons armor and abilities you want to use in your next encounter with your neighborsmeeting with your neighbors has never been more challenging  the ai for this game is fairly intuitive and you will find yourself wondering how the computer knows to make each faction react the way it does
do you want to trade with your neighbors or just conquer them
the richness and vast number of choices to make may seem overwhelming to someone totally new to colonization games but the depth of what is available will keep you coming back for moreits unfortunate that the expansion disc quotalien crossfirequot seems to be unavailable
but even without that expansion disc what other computer games have spawned a role playing game
steve jackson games recently published a gurps version of alpha centauri and that alone should give players a warning that this game will have you hooked quicklymy only dream is that both discs will be released as a single package someday
still one of my most played discs
one of my very highest recommendationsi dont really know where to begin but perhaps a good place to start would be to discuss the indepth story this game has
there is a series of books based off of this game
sid meiers as a company in my opinion did not do enough to hype this game because this game is so much better than civilization
its like civilization of the future
they should take this game and add it to the civilization as a future technology expansion like have different planets you could zoom into and run
isnt that really the next step for civilization anyways
mars
alpha centauri
the moon
ect
lol  there are a few things you have to get used to in this game like for example you can customize yor units with different armor weapons ect
and they build fastslower depending on how much they cost ect
so you see how it can get a little tricky but you can leave everything standard if you want
like i said this game has tons of depth and in my opinion is better than civilzation  which i have and am not happy with  civ  is too much hype and not enough game play
its fun but alpha centauri just does it better
this game draws you in and keeps you telling yourself just one more turn
until  hours have gone by and youre thinking to yourself just one more turn
lol  i dont know what else to say about this game except im hoping to acquire the expansion pack and i hope that sid meiers gets a clue and makes a nd version of this gamesid meiers is kind of a oneactshow when it comes to games basically most of what ive seen from him has been turnbased strategy games with singleunit armies such as civilzation and this game but i must admit hes good at what he does and i dont blame him for not leaving his comfort zone
alpha centauri is pretty much civilization with an alien futuristic twist
definitely appeals to the game types that i like and this game does not disappoint
its always fun to see if i can beat my former accomplishments in this game and it never gets oldim sure if youve been looking at this game youve probably also played the civilization series
this game has a similar blueprint to civilation but at the same time is quite differentit starts off as your average civbuilding game with the five crashed faction colonies setting up separately
as one of the faction leaders you have particular bonuses
you start off with a town a couple technologies and youre off and running trying to build up your tech tree economy military and lots of citiesinstead of barbarians though youre fighting wormlike lifeforms with psionic attack abilities that can bypass your normal defenses
in time you can learn to defend better against them and even harness these capabilities yourself which makes an intriguing extra layer to the combat here
these worms also figure into somewhat of an overarching storyline as well as told through various dream sequences your faction leader has throughoutone great thing about this game is how you can create your entirely own units
for example if you dont like the design vehicle unit with the antimatter weapons and speed upgrade you can run to the prototyope shop and swap those out with psionic weapons and the ability to paradrop so long as you have the right technologies
plus not only can you upgrade the weapons and armor on just about any unit youve already built but you can swap it out for different bonus abilities such as paradrop though all for a price
this leaves you with the ability to have the upgrade and alter all the units at your desposal to your needs rather than on regular civ games where you might get stuck with a useless cavalry unit because you cant upgrade it into a tankthe best part may be how immersive it is
alpha centauri boasts leaders with unique personalities that shape how you interact with one another
whenever you research a technology it features original quotes by these leaders and occasionally by other less important figures that can be funny enlightening and possibly even mindboggling
add to that a veritable storyline that has different outcomes based on the methods you use to beat the game and it is probably the most creative and fullyrealized fictional universe put into a strategy settinghaving replayed it recently the only drawback i can find with this game is the ai
while not necessarily bad once i got used to the game mechanics again the ai is just a bit too easy even on the highest difficulty setting
i dont know if thats because the ai hasnt aged well or i just played this game so much that i know it inside and out not to mention help from all the other strategy games ive had practice with in the intervening yearslong story short this is the most memorable civilization game and probably even strategy game altogether i have ever played
definitely worth a look if you can find it for a decent pricethis is one of the best games sid meier has ever made
this game is very much like civ ii but even better
its so addictive that you should be prepared to spend hours and hours on playing this game
if you like civ i  and civ ii and the other sid meier game this is a must buythis is an excellent game
though this is a sequel to civ ii there is no need to have experience on that game
this new game eliminates the blurring of history periods that occurs in civ ii
it also allows for  different kinds of victories
it further has many customization options
then there are the nuclear weapons
wow
you can upgrade the warheads and  the bombs get more and more powerful
at one point you can vaproize about   squares and as many cities that would be in that area
the mushroom  cloud that accompanies the strike is most impressive
unlike a lot of sims  out there this one come with very complete information and manuals
if  you enjoyed civ ii or the builing empires kind of games this is a must  havecivilization ii was the first turnbased stategy game i ever played
heck it was the first strategy game i ever played period
and it was amazing
take control of a civilization and guide from the dark ages all the way to the launch of a space ship to an alien world
the only way you can possibly describe a game that attempts to simulate all of history is epic
civilization ii was greatly loved and with good reason
it was quite possibly the most addictive strategy game ever when it was released
so when people heard about a sequel to what many considered the greatest game of all timealpha centauri
in my opinion this is the greatest computer strategy game ever to say nothing of the greatest turnbased computer strategy game ever
there is just so much to lovefirst this game is amazingly engineered
it had very low system requirements when it came out and runs fantastically on a modern machine
the interface is brilliant
the graphics are clean and detailed
the background sounds are perfect
when a technology comes up you get a voice reading about it when you build a wonder you get a cool movie to watchand there are so many ways to play within each game
you can micromanage everything telling your formers exactly what to do telling every city exactly what to build designing your own unit types
or you can set formers cities and units to be completely automaticand of course each leader you can choose has distinct advantages and disadvantages lending themselves to different playstyles
it would take quite a while to master every faction and playstyle in this gameand i havent even gone into the multiplayer the senarios and the fact that almost everything in the rules of the game is customizable
i believe there are about seven or eight ways to win
but of course the the harder ways take longer and give a higher scorein conclusion i will say this
this would be a great game if it were merely civilization in space
but what makes it the best of all time for me is the story
there is a scifi storyline to this game and when interacting with other faction leaders you almost feel like youre watching a historical epic with you as one of the main characters at least thats how i felt the first time i played
i once even found myself daydreaming about conversations i was having with different faction leaders
maybe i had just gone a little too long without sleep maybe i was just playing a little too much or maybethis is the greatest strategy game ever made
now to get back to reading the prologue i downloaded off of the offical website and download some wallpapermy opinion of this game is basically this wowi am confident in saying this is my favorite game of all time
when i started playing this game i thought it was a war game and only thought of it as that
even though i was terribly wrong you can still treat alpha centauri simply as a war game and be  satisfied with it
however its so so so much more
ive been playing it for over a year now and im still learning new features and aspects of the game that i never noticed
i like how if you are a beginner you can set base production to governor and that will direct production according to your current priorities if you dont really know what youre doing yet
also there are multiple ways of achieving victory not just conquest like most games
these include conquest conquer everyone diplomatic get elected supreme leader cooperative destroy enemies and share victory with allies economic monopolize the planets economy and transcendence begin the next stage of human evolution
there may be one or two i forgot about but as you can see its more than simply a war game
however like in reality you will need to maintain a military to defend yourself against more aggressive factionsi love how the game lets you customize certain things
your government isnt limited to despotism monarchy democracy etc  you get to choose how your government works on many different levels such as values economics etc  also you get to design your own units
want a swarm of fighters to intercept enemy aircraft without a huge support cost
you got it
want a few units equipped with nerve gas that you can paradrop into your enemies terrirory just in case things get desperate
you got that too
there are so many combinations you can create it gives the game more depth than mosti suppose the biggest negative factors are its complexity and its similarity to the civilation series
however these are minor as there are ways of simplifying gameplay and once you understand its complexity you only get that much more out of the game and even though it is similar to civilization there are also many differences and i think this game is far superior to any of the civilization gamesi could go on and on about the game but i highly recommend you at least download the demo and give it a chance
i am comfortable saying if you give it a fair chance to win you over your time will not be a wasteive played um jammer lammy when it first came out
it was as great than as it is now
a huge bonusunlock once you complete the game on a certain difficulty is all the levels but played as parapa the rappa
and yes rappingim not sure what kind of person you have to be to like this game but for the going price for a brand new disc here on amazon at  you cant go wrong
and in refrence to one review i saw yes there is a tutorialmusic games arent just another genre theyre another universe
inside that category you have everything from hitthebuttonatexactlytherightmoment of space channel  to the ensemble jamming of rock band
but once upon a time before music games were all that popular there was a cute funny japanese title called parappa the rapper for the playstation that redefined what could make a good game
it featured cute animals in a wacky story that required you to push the buttons in time to the music but also let you freestyle and improvise to a degree to get the highest scores
the songs were strange but extremely catchy and the characters were so lovable that people who were looking for something different couldnt help but love itfast forward to the sequel
instead of the puppy parappa you control the guitar player lammy whos trying to hit the big time with her band
every button press corresponds to guitar licks instead of words spoken but thats not the only change
first of all you can use the whammy bar to add that effect as you play numerous other effects are unlocked that you can also use and those effects really do change the sound of the guitar
secondly once you beat the game you start to unlock other unique options such as multiple modes of twoplayer cooperative or competitive and the ability to play the whole game as parappa rapping instead of jammingpersonally i think the guitar works way better than voice did in parappa
it just feels more like making music
and although the game can at times be frustratingly difficult the whole experience is much more accessible again just my opinion than games that use controllers that resemble musical instruments
theres no music technique involved on the basic level other than a sense of timing and the ability to hit the button youre supposed to in sequence
but again it can be really difficultill admit it
ive never been that good as rhythm and music games despite my love for them
i could never beat space channel   or  despite countless hours of practice
and i dont think i ever achieved cool ranking in parappa
i did however achieve that ranking in this game a couple of times and once you do it is one of the coolest things in any video game kind of like obtaining invincibility for a minute
basically as the game song progresses your accuracy either makes you gain or lose rank and if you do obtain the top ranking of cool you can freestyle however you want in a solo
it is just so incredibly cool playing a music instrument with just a regular controller
the next closest thing i can think of is the percussion jamming you can do while shooting down enemies in rez
theres just something really wonderful about creating your own improvisations to music and if youre never gonna make it playing a real instrument or in a band for that matter it may be the only solo time you get in life
true its no rock band but the two games are apples and oranges and this game is decidedly japanesetruly a game this strange could only come out of japan
as with the first game parappa everything is paper cutouts the songs are all about performing a task making a guitar with a chainsaw landing a plane putting out a fire ect but they are all great in their wacky way
there is also tremendous variety in the types of songs which range from the now classic master onion chop to the splitpersonality thrash rock of the plane song
of course its all feel good stuff culminating in a superfeelgood climax of the band playing their big gigwith all the unlockables this game is a great value
if you loved parappa you should definitely buy a copy
and even if you didnt you may want to give it a try
i have yet to find a person who enjoyed playing the twoplayer with me but the five minutes my older sister codemaster talon did play with me were pure magic i recently ordered a ngpcreceived it the other day and i must say even in though we are bombarded with the hype regarding the psp and ds this system still rocks
very simple to use and has a great library of games which include metal slug fatal fury puzzle bobble and snk v capcom just to name a fewit is too bad that snk pulled the plug on this console before it even made a dent in the us but i think the fact that it is an extinct system adds remarkably to its appeal
get yourself one of these systems while they are still cheap and availablei have recently purchased the neo geo pocket game system
my son currently has a nintendo game boy sp but i wanted a little something for me while i am waiting in the airports and so forth
i found this little system on amazon and saw the price and figured it would be worth a shot
man was i amazed
the system may not have a large library of games but the games that are available are very entertaining to say the least
my son even put down his game boy and prefers to play the neo geo
the games are very cheap compared to other handhelds
i highly recommend this system if you want something to play that is entertaining and is fairly cheap
however if you are looking for a system with a huge library of games this may not be the right system for youpros good graphics and easy to use controlsgames are very entertainingprice is very cheap compared to most systemscons small library of gamesutilizes aa batteries instead of lithium rechargeablescreen is not backliti still believe it is a diamond in the ruffa really fun old school system that is way affordable
forget the ds and get all the kids a pocket neo geo for the price of one ds
the system has tons of great first party classics and fighting games
the screen isnt backlight but that is the only negative i can think of for this really good handheldat the time when the neo geo pocket color was released i like many others didnt buy it because i wanted a game boy color
snk although extremely successful in japan was not able to match the popularity of nintendos wellmarketed new handheld console in america
sadly snk usa eventually went under and the neo geo pocket color disappeared from shelvesalthough the neo geo pocket color didnt sell as well as nintendos game boy color in america that is not to say that it didnt deserve more credit than it was given
the ngpc arguably has the best fighting game titles of any handheld console
games such as snk vs capcom match of the milennium king of fighters r samurai showdown  and fatal fury first contact are part of what the ngpc is still best known for
the builtin thumbstick also gives fighting game fans the option of straying from the traditional directional pad on a handheld console and allows for a much better way of playing the quartercircle oriented games
aside from the snk fighting game titles the ngpc hosted a slew of wonderful and very addictive puzzle games including bustamove puzzle link and magical dropfor some people the problem with the neo geo pocket color was the lack of variety on the part of its games genres
for those who werent fans of fighting or puzzle games the ngpc really didnt have a lot to offer at least not enough to buy what used to be a  console
although the ngpc had a fair number of sports titles and classic hits such as pacman sonic the hedgehog pocket adventure metal slug first strike and pocket sports series  baseball stars it just wasnt enough to compete with nintendos evergrowing list of popular games
there were a few rpgs made for the ngpc but most kids fell to the lures of nintendos new pokemon games insteadthe neo geo pocket color has the ability to play imported games which is very nice since some ngpc games like last blade were not released in america
the games will obviously still be in japanese when you play them but they can be played on the american console
my only real complaint about the ngpc is the lack of a backlit screen but when the ngpc came out most handheld consoles didnt have that feature if they did they ate batteries like crazy  cough sega game gear
the thumbstick was a wonderful addition to the console and allowed for much better gameplay than did consoles with only directional pads
overall the neo geo pocket color was a very sophisticated and sadly overlooked console with the best goodtobad game ratio of all handheld systems
i would recommend any serious gamer to get one especially if you enjoy great fighting games
the neo geo pocket color didnt get all the attention it deserved but it really did bring a whole new dimension to the world of video gamesit actually fits in my pocket
the colors look great
the sound is perfect
everything seems to be in order
the seller even threw in match of the millennium for free
wow
what a great findsince im reviewing the system as a whole ill try not to go into detail about individual games too much but rather give you reasons to buy this system and which games you should look intoi got my ngpc a little late in the game about  years ago but i have to say that since then ive played it more than most other handheldseven to this day with only my ds rivaling it at the moment
i now have about  games total including a few rare ones and not a single one of them is bad which is a lot more than i can say for some of my gba and psp gamesnow i know a lot of people wouldnt bother picking one up for a few of the more common reasons dated graphics
no lit screen
no recargable battery
small game librarywell let me address those individually
to start with  the graphics on this little machine are pretty amazing
you do have to consider the time it came out but even now im still impressed with how this thing looks and plays
you have to understand that the ngpc was going up against the game boy color and the ngpc looks a lot better than the gbc ever did in all respects
screenshots can be easily found online so i suggest looking some up if you dont believe me as for not having a lit screen this is a big draw back
however if you do some googling you can find companies that will install front lights for a minimal charge
basically they take the light from a gba sp and install it on a ngpc
it makes things much nicer let me tell youunfortunately at least to my knowledge there is no rechargable battery mod for the ngpc
however this really isnt an issue since the battery life is amazing
ive read reports of up to  hours gameplay off  aas
i generally use a battery pack which can be had online very cheap so i cant say for certain how long  aas last but i can say that ive only had to change mine once since i got mine over  years agoand finally  the small library of games is a little bit of a let down but the difference between the gb which has tons of games and the ngpc which has few is that nearly all ngpc games are good games
the gb has tons of bad games which should have never seen the light of day as do the gba ds psp etc
sure the ngpc has its share of poor titles all systems do but the percentage of good games vastly outweighs the bad
let me give you a few examples from my libraryif you were ever into fighting games then you will adore this system
if youve been a fighting fan you should know that up until recently handheld fighters have been pretty poor compared to their original versions mortal kombat on game gear or street fighter ii on game boy anyone
well snk has done an amazing job porting over these classic titles in such detail that you will wish they made console versions in the same style
trust me
if you dont believe me do some searching online for these titlessnk vs capcom match of the milleniumking of fighters r theres also an r which was on the black and white neo geo pocket and is fully playable on the color systemsamurai showdown again theres a bw verison of ngpthe last blade beyond the destinyfatal fury first contactgals fightersrockman battle  fighters japanese only port of the mega man arcade fighting gamesi highly recommend all of the above although rockman is kind of rare now days
the games play so much like their original versions if there was one you wont belive it
unlike older handheld fighters move lists are complete the number of playable characters is amazing amount of unlockablesreplay value in some is just crazy and the addition of a little joystick rather than a usual dpad makes these fighters feel right at homethe ngpc has its share of good rpgs and other types of games too
it even has a really awesome sonic the hedgehog game which plays just like the ones on genesis not like the more recent titles on gba
not to mention one of the most popular ngpc games ever snk vs capcom card fighters clash
look up reviews on that one and its reason enough to get this system
if you like pokemon or yugioh then youll love card fighters clash
even if you dont like that kind of stuff youll like cfcseriouslythe bottom line is that the neo geo pocket color can be had so cheap these days as little as  for just the system sometimes theres no reason not to at least give it a chance
games can be had for as little as  even for many of the titles i mentioned above and are brand new
for example for about  you can get a system  games an ac adapter a battery pack and an worm light
thats pretty commonone last thing to note is that as with most handhelds the games are region free meaning it doesnt matter if you get a japanese version of a game itll still play on a us system
snk did one better though and many of the games support all the languages too
you set what language you want on your system it has a bios similar to the ds and the games will play in that language regardless of where they came fromthis isnt true for all games though so be sure to research the specific title first if you cant find a us or uk version
i have several jp and uk games in addition to my us ones and the only one i had that wouldnt support english was the jp version of gals fighters
so if you want that one find a us or uk version
the jp one is still playable but the story is so hilarious youll want to be able to read itin short if you like handhelds games in general or are just bored and looking for something to do then the ngpc is a good solution for you
the system is small enough to fit in your pocket and fun enough to give you hours of enjoyment for the little amount youll pay for itit is sad to see that snk has decided to discontinue neo geo pocket sales in north america because the ngp is by far the best portable system around
the ngp has the best graphics availiable in a porrtable console and  features many of the best portable games
almost every pocket game is of  high quality and on average their games are twice as good as gameboy
since they have decided to discontinue north american sales i wouldnt  advise buying this system unless you can afford to buy many of their great  games before amazoncom runs out
this really is the best portable systemi finally got my hands on a copy of this
its a version from europe for some reason the american release date isnt for a month or so
regardless im sure the game will be the same
so let me tell you about it
my first impressions are holy smokes
this game is going to be a huge hit
im not sure where to start
well for one the graphics are simply amazing
you can fly a huge variety of planes be it american or german
but the best plane to fly is the b of course
you can man all  positions in the plane and during a mission can switch back and forth
during attacks you are so busy keeping track of everything the time just flys by
you can man a gun turret pilot the aircraft or even be the bombadier
and if you are unfortunate enough to get shot down well dont fret just switch planes and continue the mission
you can jump into any plane you want be it the bomber or your escorts
there are tons of missions to choose from as well
you can do the standard quick missions training longer missions from start to finish and various campaigns both historic and some created ones
im amazed they packed this all onto one cd
this game has been in the making for so long but it was definetly worth the wait
anyone who likes wwii flight sims will fall in love with this game
ive only had it for a few days since it came in the mail
if you cant wait get it from a euro dealer otherwise it shouldnt be much longer till north american audiences enjoy thisi had another b game some years ago
this one is significantly different
this is a real challenge
first the instrumentation and interior graphics are very good
they could be improved by allowing the flyer to operate the flight deck controls with the mouse but that is nitpicking
the exterior graphics are not stateoftheart but they are plenty good enough to really experience the game
the sound is good and realistici had better identify my equipment so that you can judge my viewpoint
i have a  mhz pentium  with a halfgig of ram and my os is microsoft windows me
video is ati
i use a ch flightstick pro usb and ch pro pedals usb with control manager
the brakes do not work with this simulationeverything else works fine and the loading was easyas to my experience im in my midseventies and made my first solo in the mid s
ive flown a variety of single engine aircraft over the years but have little multiengine experience and that only as air crew except on the computer
ive also built and flown a variety of radiocontrolled aircraft
i have flown just about every decent simulator on the market since  but my specialty is wwii aircraft since that is my generation
im partial to the pacific theater and particularly love the ff hellcat as a fighter planeit accounted for nearly  percent of all the japanese aircraft shot down in airtoair combat in the pacific and had a  kill ratio
not bad
it also made more aces than any other allied singleengine fighter planei mostly fly fighters
i think the best combat flight sim for graphics and flight characteristics currently on the market is il sturmovik
janes wwii fighters and and microsofts combat flight sim  are neckandneck for second place and im looking at ms combat flight sim  with high hopesthis is a good sim
it is very realistic in the flight characteristics of a large multiengine prop driven aircraft
the sounds are very realistic as well and for those who think it is a difficult gameit is
but then so is actually flying such an aircraft but it can be learned
practice practice practicethe ability to move from one crew position to the next easily is not realistic but it is great fun
one thing i appreciate is the very thing that bugs many the fact that you can spend hours on a single missionin fact you can spend several minutes stacked up orbiting your own airfield just waiting to land after a mission
oh you can avoid it by speeding things up to x time but of course the actual aircrews were simply stuck with it
thats just the way it wasin real life it was hours weeks sometimes months of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror
hurry up and wait was as typical of wwii as kilroy was here
but do you want to get a feel for how it really was without the gutwrenching fear of course or do you just want to play another game
one thing about the boredom of hours of droning enginesit lulled the crew so that when the action suddenly started when a bf or fw or god help us
an me suddenly bounced you out of the sun it was all the more unexpectedthis is of course not like being at war
not even close
the people who really flew in these ships actually died as you know
more than  men from the th died over europe
thats the entire crew of  different aircraft
losses were high
it was hard to get through the  missions required alive
for the luftwaffe it was if anything worse
there was no limit to the number of their missions
they flew until they were killed or the war ended whichever came firsti recommend this game if you have the patience and the equipment tofly it properly
if you are simply looking for something that will allow you to shoot down lots of enemy quickly this is probably not for youjoe pierre usn retok first of all let me tell you the game works fine
it didnt crash on my system and it didnt crash on two of my other computers one of them only runs on a pii  mhz
i think the problem lies with the user
during installation do not install the ad drivers
its just common sense
if you dont have an ad soundcard then dont install the drivers
plain and simple
some users feel they need to install every thing the game asks them to install but in reality you dont have to
basic point is to know what your computer has
this game will ask you to install direct x a
if you have direct xa then dont install direct x a because its an older driverwhen the game boots you will be given the option to create a graphics cache file
if you dont set the graphics cache file the game will crash
most users are so hot to get into the game that they neglect the little details of setting up options
all you have to do is set the graphics cache file
the graphics cache file uses about  mb of your swap file
heres a trick
clean up your os system drive
remove junk files in your temp folder in fact remove everything you see in your temp folder
next go clean the temp internet files foldernow to the game
patch the game before you play it
download patch  mb
ok the game is very realistic
for rookie sim fans wanting to fly and do some sightseeing around germany on a b this is not the game for you
by the time you get close to one of the radar sites surrounding germany dozens of attack fighters will feed you with lead until you either crash or turn back
this is a war sim ergo no free fly mode
graphics does the job in the game although not that spectacular for most of the flight youll be looking at open pastures and green until you get to your target
the travel time is very realistic
from your airbase to your target youll actually be flying the whole trip in real time
sit back and relax during this trip its going to be a long tripenjoy it while it lasts because once the shooting happens youll be scambling for dear life
missions in the game are historical and they are very difficult to accomplish but not impossible
flight dynamics are superb specially after you patch the game
these bombers are just hard to fly but hey this is  people they dont have the hardware like what planes have now
special mention to the norden bombsight instrument
this is a bit complicated to use
it shouldnt surprise history buffs since most of the bombs dropped during wwii never really did hit their targets
dont expect to see huds or targetting reticles here
everything is dead aiming and pure luckoverall this game is awesome
it gave me a sense of just being inside the b anticipating and waiting for the coming quotstormquot when flaks and enemy fighters start coming at youbuy this game follow the tips i gave you and it should work
oh and did i tell you the game hasnt crashed since i installed iteven after playing dozens of newer titles on newer systems this is still one of the great games out there  give yourself a gift and get a hold of iton the surface this d scrollingview adventure game seems no different that all the classic castlevania games from the ancient nes system but from the second you start playing it you remember why those first few ancient castlevania games were so great
they are as addictive as they are fun to play as is this playstation versionyou play as alucard halfhuman son of dracula
as a plot twist it seems that richter belmont decendent of legendary vampire hunter simon belmont has called the evil castlevania back from the depths of oblivion and summoned forth the evil dracula
with the help of the mysterious adventurer maria you must guide alucard through the huge maze of castlevania to determine if richter is indeed behind the evil plotsotn combines elements of classic castlevania with an action packed roleplaying game
find hundreds of items weapons powerups and secrets hidden throughout this complex new castle of dracula
fight against newer challenging enemies as well as the classics from the original series
the music is wellorchestrated and catchy
if you can find the first edition of this game out there anywhere it comes with a collectors cd full of music from the game but that one is out of print and hard to findanyway i love this game
i can take it out of the console for months at a time but as soon as i hear anyone make a reference to it i am immediately hooked again
as soon as you start playing you will not want to stop
true some of the bosses seem easy in comparison to other games but the constant sense of making progress and finding new secrets keeps you interested from beginning to endwith so many d rendered games to choose from this may game seem obsolete but trust me when i say that castlevania was never meant to go d and this the greatest d castlevania environment to date puts all the d versions to shame
i have beaten this game at least  times but i find something new every time i play
if you were a fan of the oldschool castlevania games or even bloodlines from sega genesis then you too will love this game which i recommend over any n version
plus its cheap
stop thinking about it and buy this gamethe sony playstation debuted and along came a slew of games that would propel it to greatness
one of the games that made every kid want to own one is none other than castlevania symphony of the night
an excellent playstation title and theres no doubt in my mind that its the greatest castlevania game on the face of the earth
dont believe me
too bad now read on anywaythe goodyou play as alucard the son of dracula and hes improved over his castlevania iiines version
the whole castle environment is done in the same vein as zebes was in super metroid in fact the whole game borrows from super metroid
you might think thats bad but the gaming geniuses at konami utilized that tactic and made it worthwhile
the soundtrack kicksespecially richter belmonts theme speaking of which hes also a playable character
the graphics were stateoftheart for the playstations debut and theyre very stylish and of course in the castlevania style
also being a huge fan of super metroid and castlevania this game not only throws in its own goodies but has that good ol old school feel to it
this game also has items galore and you can collect cards to cast magic spells and use familiarsthe badaside from the ending credits song that grates on my nerves i am the wind i find absolutely nothing wrong with the game
if you do find something wrong consult your physicianoverallsome might claim this as the best game of alltime i cant claim that but its certainly the best in the longrunning castlevania series
i doubt therell be a castlevania that will beat this one for all you  lovers castlevania  and legacy of darkness arent that great
its superb gameplay and style marks this as a great game and it should never be forgotten
if youve never played a castlevania game before i highly recommend you start here
if you hate this game have at youits nice that all these great games for the original playstation are being rereleased especially for castlevania fans
thats because symphony of the night not only one of the best castlevania games but also arguably one of the best for the psx is one of the games being rereleased
look up any review for the game from websites and magazines and youll see nothing but praise for this classic
at amt from amazon how can you lose
get this gamethis is the first game i wanted to buy when i got my playstation sadly it is super rare and took my  months to find used
this is probably the rarest playstation game which is sad because it is also one of the bestit combines classic castlevania gameplay with rpg elements such as the use of magic and level points system and a deeper storyline
also adding to the depth is the use of money relics that give special abilities and a wider variety of weapons
the ability to equip weapons of your choice is a first for the series
by far the coolest is the ability to transform you can be a bat a wolf or fog 
the main character is alucard spell it backwards who older gamers might remember from castlevania  for nes
you meed a wide array of characters some good some bad throughout your journey through draculas castle
the object of the game same as the restfind and destroy dracula and end the vampire bloodlinethe graphics are classic d which might turn off some gamers hoping for something more like castlevania  which was fullyrendered d
despite the d the control and character movement is greatly enhanced thanks to better animation and smooth controls
castlevania games always had great music and sotn is among the best in that department
each score perfectly matches the given environment with beautifuly orchestrated melodies
dont let the oldschool look discourage you this is an amazing gamecalling castlevania sotn simply a nastalgia trip while true in my case would degrade the value of the game
it is an excellent and addictive game that satisfies on almost every level
it ranks among the best games for the playstation and you sould expect to pay a hefty price for a copy
it is now superrareas the first castlevania game i have got this game set a good example and now i am collecting castlevania games
as alucard halfvampire and halfhuman you must fight your way throughout a giant castle
although somewhat easy it is one of the best games  i have ever played for the playstation
the graphics arent too good for it is a d sidescrolling game
usually sidescrolling games arent very good but this is awesome
this game tekken  and crash bash are the best games i have probably ever played
in other words unless youre cracked up this game will be one of the best games you have ever played
now since i got lots of new games im off to rate more games
good nighti played this game years after it was released and could not believe how well it has held up
it truly is an amazing game
what makes this game so spectacular is the ambience it creates
although the graphics are over  years old the colors are soo vibrant and the orchestrated score is fantastic prolly the best of any video game ive ever played
each portion of the castle is like an amazing  painting
it truly is a work of art
the castle is dark creepy and full of life
the plot is really good as well despite some horrid english acting that will be ridiculed untill the end of time
lol you control alucard the half vampire and half human son of dracula as he tries to stop his father
alucard is an awesome looking character to control and with constant upgrades to collect it is rewarding to see him progress into a powerful force
this game laid the foundation for the excellent portable castlevanias on nintendo systems but it still remains the best out of all of them
the ambiance the music the simple but rewarding gameplay and the colorful graphics still outdo its successors
definitely one of the greatest games of all timethis game which started the trend of all those terrific gameboy castlevanias like dawn of sorrow is an awesome play and a top  of just about everyones playstation game listfirst off this game is huge
you have to play through this game twice to get the entire experience and real ending to this game
it has a second quest much like the old school ghosts and goblins if you can remember that game but with its own unique invereted waythe amount of items you can gather and collect in this game is staggering too
there are numerous swords and spells to pick up and just about every weapon has its own special abilities which adds a lot to this game
because of that no weapon seems the sameand the relics just plain old rock
they give you abilities like changing into bats wolves mist forms and allowing you to do super jumps and double jumps to unlock new areasalso the hundreds of different bosses and enemies are all interesting to hunt down and slaughter
especially the cool looking bosses which can sometimes span an entire couple of screensthough this game is extremely rare to try to get a hold of now if youre a playstation gamer or action fan then you owe it to yourself to pick this up
its one of the most complete and enjoyable actionadventure games of the last ten yearsquite simply this is quite possibly the best game ever made period
by taking the standard formula which super metroid perfected on the super nintendo of finding items and opening up new areas castlevania symphony of the night excels on every level to combine and create the most significant game accomplishment in my opinion ever made
by using the standard side scrolling elements of the classic games from the  bit days and combining them with some of the lushest and most breathtaking visuals and special effects the hand drawn effect that this game creates rivals almost any game on the original playststion
the music is etheral accomplishment and ranks at the top of my best soundtracks for a game ever joining the ranks of chrono trigger final fantasy vi and silent hill  as some of the most noticeable and well done music to ever pass through the gaming world
the music combines orchestra type composure in a rock opera vibe that fits every single enviroment so well that you will never dread entering any area in fact you wil even find yourself backtracking to previous areas just to hear this music again by the way i own the soundtrack thats how damn good this games music is
the gameplay is some of the best ever in a game incorporating all the classic elements of the castlevania series and combining them with experience and equipping items from role playing games to form a natural bond that still makes me wonder why more developers have not tried to make a game like this probably due to the fact that few could accomplish what konami has done with this game
the only weak part of this game is the voice acting which literally sucks pun intended it seems like they picked people who were overly ambitious in their voice acting skills and im sure the dialogue was bad because of the japanes to english translation when it was brought stateside
beyond that though if you buy this game i can guarantee you will not be dissappointed
every boss fight every encounter everything about this game pushes it leaps and bounds ahead of the competion
no dimensional game i have ever played can crete the sheer passion and joy of controlling alucard his movements and actions are graceful and even just picking up the hp max ups is a chilling experience
this game cannot be missed and i guarantee that i will still play this game when i am like  years old and wondering what in the hell happenned to the artistry and pure skill that a two dimensional oldschool game can pull off and achieve so welllove it or hate it this is side scrolling action at its best
i see that a lot of people complained that it borrowed from metroid i say kudos
metroid was also great and was in my opinion the best side scroller until sotn
you can read any number of reviews for the particulars but i want to point out that this game is available for  to download from the ps store onto your ps or pspoh yeahwhere do i begin
i have played the first four classic entries of the series and lament of innocence the mercury steam lords of shadow and mirror of fate and i must say that not only was this entry released in konamis prime but they have given the name castlevania a whole new meaning while adding to the overall gameplay experience
the environment of the game is astoundingly detailed with d background effects including moving objects in full d and the creativity involved in developing the enemies make it that much easier to immerse yourself in this wonderful complete fantasy world and escaping reality
with that being said seeing that this game was directly influenced by super metroid and perhaps some of the other nintendo entries to the series i must say that the metroidstyle gameplay was executed beautifully with all kinds of different suits or cloaks you can pick up fluid controls and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that fits each and every one of its perspective environments the tracks were made for
another excellent aspect of this game is the idea of leveling up your character to increase stats and such
that was beautifully implemented rewarding you with easier gameplay if you destroy enough enemies and find the most powerful cloaks and weapons you can find in the game
you can also acquire various transformations that will turn your character into either a bat a purple wolf or simply a handful of mist so you can pass through obstacles that were blocked before
overall this game is the most groundbreaking entry of the series and it is one that i would not mind playing again and again as the gameplay is as versatile as it gets with these style of gamesone of the best ps games ive ever played
it nicely incorporates both action and rpg elements
plus vampires are cool
so its got it allcastlevania symphony of the night is one of the reasons i hold onto my playstation  as the playstation  for some stupid reason will not play older games
i have passed this game several times and every couple of years i feel the itch to revisit it
this game is castlevania at its finestdespite the terrible voice actors and mediocre graphics
the bosses are tough as are many of the areas of the castle and figuring out how to progress in some places can be a challenge but the rewards are great
this game has endless replay value imhoive been playing games since i can remember
unlike the current crop of wannabe hardcore gamers i really am one
ive been playing games before the psx before the snes  i still remember when the nes came out
but in all my years of gaming never have i played a game as amazing and beautiful as konamis quotcastlevania symphony of the nightquot the breathtaking graphics the rich and haunting soundtrack the perfect controlall of this adds up to nothing compared to the gameplay itself which is of unrivaled magnitude
after richter belmont had defeated dracula in the last quotcastlevaniaquot all seemed pleasantuntil now
one night four years after the supposed demise of dracula richter simply vanished
with no idea as to where to go maria renard richters sisterinlaw went out on her search for him when it happened castlevania home of dracula had suddenly appeared
you play as alucard the offspring of a human woman and dracula himself
then you enter castlevania
d
bah
the game mixes both the d sidescrolling and rpg genres perfectly
fans of both genres and those like myself that love both genres will no doubt cherish this game
this is easily the biggest quotcastlevaniaquot game so far
theres over  different villians around a dozen spells a vast array of weapons and armor and multiple endings
so take a few days off from work andor school because youre gonna need em
the graphics are absolutely gorgeous
i still ask myself why everyones jumping on fancy d engines when they could create a game like this
could you imagine a d quotcastlevaniaquot on dreamcast
drools anyways the graphics on this game are topnotch stuff
lots of detail on every little character and background
the control is as easy as it gets
anyone could pick this up and start playing right away
the music thoughit just cant be put into words
this is on par with squaresofts best work
yeah im serious
usually when playing games i pop in a dead can dance cd or something but this soundtrack is too epic to miss
alucard has lots of different spells he can use all of which are quite effective and beautifully drawn
theres also relics which alucard collects and they are needed to beat the game
some relics tell you the damage you cause to your enemy one lets you do a double jump and then theres some that let you transform into a wolf bat or mist
the game offers a decent challenge by now after all these years of gaming there isnt much that i have trouble with but it did offer me a challenge by trying to collect everything in the game
there is a lot of favorite moments for me in this game but the moment that stuck out the most in my head was the confession booth
it didnt do anything except hurt you if the curtains close but it stuck out in my head
its as close as ill ever get to a real one im antireligous
all i can say is that you have absolutely no excuse as to why you shouldnt own a copy youre not even a real gamer if you dont own this
the quotcastlevaniaquot games that followed this one were mediocre at best and thats when you dont compare them to this one so i wouldnt recommend those n quotsequelsquot at all
i wish konami had continued the series with direction they were going with for this game
you can go ahead and keep your quotmetal gear solidquot ill stick with this
quotcastlevania symphony of the nightquot isnt a masterpiece its the masterpiece
now go get it if you still dont have itthis is an awesome game and was worth getting it for my ps to have with my other castlevania games
i just love the sound track and the graphics for its time were very good
the only complaint i have is that when you die you dont get a continue and you have to wait through a death screen and then have to go through reloading your file all over again
other than that this game is a classic one of the best castlevania gamesthere is a reason handdrawn sidescrollers are still being made there is so much expression in these games that cannot yet be displayed in polygons and castlevania symphony of the night is no exception
the characters and backgrounds are very welldrawn the tunes set the tone well the controls are top notch the storyline is great and the animation is perfectin addition to be to being quite possibly the best sidescroller ever made symphony of the nights music holds true to the title with wellorchestrated tunes that only a jaded misosymphonist yes i made that up could hateas the story goes dracula rises once every century to terrorize the the innocents of transylvania
this is where a belmont usually comes in to thwart draculas evil plots and send him back to where he came from
when dracula dies albeit temporarily his castle vanishes with him
this time however things are a little differentonly four years after richter belmont defeated the count draculas castle rises again
maria rennard richters cousin who helped him defeat dracula decides to investigate the castle after her cousin mysteriously disappearsover  years ago dracula was betrayed by his son alucard who aided trevor belmont in draculas defeat along with grant a nimble thief and sypha a vampirehunting sorceress
now alucard who had put himself into what was supposed to be an eternal sleep has risen again to put an end to his father  permanentlyas alucard you fight draculas evil minions while exploring the castle and the ground upon which it sits
the castle itself is made up of main halls a church a bell tower a courtyard and a library among other things
under ground are the abandoned mine and the catacombs
things get even more interesting when or if you get to an upsidedown version of the castle where you face an evil grim reaper in earth above the castle and eventually vlad himselfwhat i also like about the game is the way it somewhat portrays the real vlad tepes dracule with impaled victims in the background and an equally menacing portraitso is there anything wrong with this game
ofcourse there is
while you will get the chance to play as richter youll never be able to play as maria unless you buy a japanese sega saturn or an american one with a modchip and nocturn in the moonlightkonami also screwed maria when they released dracula x on super nintendo in america
maria was playable in the turbo pccd version in japanso i get this game free with purchase of castlevania lords of shadow which is also a pretty good game
people say lords of shadow is a great game but it is not a castlevania game
so to figure out what castlevania games are all about i give castlevania symphony of the night a try
and wow just wow
this game is simply incredible
after finishing this game both actual and secret endings here is what i thoght
proscastle exploration gameplay no spoiler here but most castlevania games are about going into count draculas castle and finding and destroying him and in process of doing so encountering and finding a great number of vicious enemies some really awesome monsterous bosses and awesome weapons and upgrades
similar to other castlevania games this one also has a huge castle where you the son of dracula can roam around structure to another doing everything stated aboveweapons secondary weapons summons relics upgrades transformations and all type of splendid stuff while exploring huge castle emphasis on the word huge you will find great number of different weapons swords mace blades secondary weapons holy water throwing axe and some weird things and relics that will either allow you to summon various allies by your side or transform you into beasts with different abilities
guess being a human sympathetic son of dracula comes with its own advantages
search for these items will really push you explore the castle
while some are not so hard to find the good ones are well hidden and will require a through exploration or use of a guideridiculous variety in enemies and tremendous bosses loved it just loved it
i was surprised to see there were so many different types of enemies in the game
to top it off defeating them and making your way through the castle rewards you with spectacular boss fights
these bosses vary from your own doppelganger to almighty you know who
there are so many so many awesome bosses
just be sure to explore the castle throughlycastle and reverse castle now if you just rush through the game without exploring all the area you will not get to challenge the real main boss of the game
to do so you have to explore the castle throughly meet certain conditions and unlock the reverse castle which is practically a reverse version of castle you play but with  tougher enemies and more awesome bosses
i cant tell you much without spoiling but it is not hard to do
you just have to know somethingleveling up the main character beating enemies and bosses will give you xps and level you up making you stronger adding rpg element to the game
so if you are not as skilled then leveling up and then fighting the boss is always an option
i personally got addicted to this and finding itemsgreat graphics art level designs for a ps game yup not much to elaborate here
i loved the reverse castle design and idea
again you have to play it to see what i am talking aboutplay with different character in addition to son of dracula you can also play as a vampire hunter with very different abilities you just have to finish the game once
conssecretive places while you can get map of the castle early on you still cant locate many important secret places on that map
i wish they had some type of secret map available so one wouldnt have to rely on online guides
other than this i can complain about the graphics and stuff but it is a ps game so judging it by todays standard wont be fair
conclusionif you are new to castlevania franchise and want to learn more this is a great place to start
it will truly give you a good idea what castlevania games are all about and why lords of shadow is a great game but it is not exactly a castlevania to be precisethis game without a doubt is by far the best game in the castlevania series
even if you previously havent played any of the other games its still worth it
theres not much else to say besides its a classic d game and perfectly dark
alucard is a great main characterbut thats not just the reason its so good
everything about it is greatfrom the d landscapes and backroundsto the vast selection of weaponry and armorand relicsall the way to the voiceovers
there are also tons of secret corridors that will take an eternity to find
whether you like classic games or not you will probably like thisforget those lamo n castlevaniasthis is where its ati remember when i first got this game  when it first came out when i was a junior in high school
i played this game all night and called in sick for work over christmas break to keep playing
this is undoubtably best game ive ever played in my life and i doubt that anyone has the brains to follow it up in a similar style
i mean at least capcom had the brains to follow up with millions of mega man sequels that were all alike but all of the subsequent castlevania sequels after quotsymphonyquot just are nothing like it
the quotquot versions totally suck compared to it
oh well i guess id better find another copy of this disc before i get it scratched so many times that its unplayable
if you havent played it buy it
otherwise you are losing the best video game experience that you will ever have
runners up for best games of my life  secret not legend of mana chrono trigger not cross time crisis distant th but still excellentesince castlevania iv on the snes is the only other castlevania i have played up until now i shall compare symphony of the night in relative to it a lotplotalucard a vampire himself seeks to rid the world of draculas tyranny and his own cursed bloodline
interesting that it would be a vampire fighting another vampireand who is this maria renard
why has she come to castlevania
and how was she able to enter the castle when only members of the belmont clan are able tographicsthe graphics seem to look much smaller flatter and less detailed than they did in castlevania iv
graphics in castlevania iv seemed to stand out more but that was probably because they were larger
still the graphics in symphony of the night are not bad at all even for the year  they even try to please some of us d diehards with a few polygonal renderings but there are not many of thosesoundthe music in keeping with castlevania tradition is gothic rock and gothic rock read excellent
the music sounds even better on the soundtrack cd
definitely some classy orchestral music in there toothe game features a few voiceovers which are not too badthey at least attempted to add a good degree of drama to the conversationsgameplaythe gameplay was probably what was most intriguing in relative to castlevania iv
though an action platformer at heart it adds some rpg elements strength and other stats are quantified you can obtain and change weapons and other equipment and carry items for later use like health potions certainly couldnt do that in castlevania ivwouldve made it easier
furthermore your character no longer uses the traditional whip but a sword insteadfurthermore draculas castle is one large dungeon that connects back into itself you can revisit rooms you were at earlier rather than the linear onestageatatime progression that composed castlevania iv
this may make the game seem like metroid but thankfully you do not need to backtrack as much since warps are available to transfer you between distant rooms
and there is always a savepoint nearby  making it ideal for a halfhour play when ever the feeling grabs youoveralloverall if you are looking for a d sidescrolling platformer with some action rpg elements mixed in well like some of those old but good nes action rpgs this should be your thingespecially if you want a platformer with a more mature refined taste
definitely something that can be picked up easily again and again even after long periods of withdrawali love castlevania and this is the best d castlevania ever made
unfortunately i didnt buy a copy  years ago so i guess ill have to download it on xbox live arcade since price gouging has come to the playstation version i traded in my old playstation and i heard that it isnt compatible with the pss backwards compatability mode a shameif it was less than  i would definitely pick up the playstation version and a used playstation but  is outrageous when it is available for less than  that price on xbox live arcade
classic all the waythis game is great on its own merits
however it is a breakaway from the traditional castlevania level based format
second of all you are not one of the belmonts or a human at all you are a halfvampire
thirdly you do not have a whip you have a sword
despite the breaking of many of the castlevania traditions this is a spectacular game
great graphics great music great gameplay
as a consolation there is a way to play as richter belmont after beating the gamethis is my second favorite of the castlevania series the best of all being castlevania dracula x for the turbographx  console
do not play the dracula x for super nintendo
it sucksif you have read my previous castlevania reviews you know how much i love these games and symphony of the night is no exception
this game is just awsomethe gameplay is fun the graphics are great and the music is kick ass
this is the best castlevaina game out there so far and with castlevainalords of shadows coming out soon it is going to be hard to top this masterpice
all in all i highly recommend it if you dont want to buy it and have xbox live or playsation network you can buy it there alsoa miserable little pile of awesome
i bought this game a few weeks ago at a play n trade and i must say that this game is fantasticthe most superb d side scroller ive ever had the chance to play
fun challenging clever
the world in this game is huge and the variety of unique monsters and bosses none of which are clones of each other in terms of tactics and strategies to beat them make this game even more challenging sometimes annoying but in a good way a way that allows for some thought into finding better ways to beating them
and the dialogue between characters its like watching an animated movie in terms of scripting beautiful and intriguing not shallow or bombasticthis is a game i shall never sell to any store
this is mine for as along as i can play thisa keepergame that youd be foolish to depart with unless its to a friend or family member but thats itthis is one of the greatest games ever made period
i loved the highly underrated castlevania  and when i spotted symphony in the store i knew i had to have it
but it came in a discount case that hid the back of the game case and when i took off the packagaing and saw the screenshots on the back my heart sank
it was d
how could a d game possible stand up to a d game
man was i in for a surprisethe first thing i noticed was the music was astonishing
when i first walked into the castle and the tragic prince started my mouth was hanging open
i immediately cranked up the volume
theres everything from haunting hard rock to beautiful orchestrated tracks
the best game soundtrack ive ever heard by far
i even found myself turning the game on just to listen to the music
youll definetely want the soundtrackthe hand drawn graphics may be d but they are nevertheless gorgeous
everything is so detailedthe side scroller platformrpg gameplay is a blast
the castle is huge and youll never tire of exploring it and uncovering new relics and weapons
and at the end theres even a way to unlock the upsidedown castle with new music and graphics
theres just so much replayability herethe voice acting is admittedly awful but it doesnt detract from the gameplay at allif you own a psone or a ps you must own sotn
i also recommend castlevania  even though a lot of people hated it
its much better than lament of innocence which is basically a repetitive boring hack and slash fest with pretty graphicsive been playing through all the castlevania games lately and none of them hold a candle to this masterpiece
everything you want in a gothic horror platformer is here
you will find that the rpg elements work seamlessly with the rest of the action packed gameplaythe music is amazing with guitar riffs classical arrangements and so much more
if that doesnt grab you youll be astonished by the monsters mayhem and pacing that is found in this game
i spent hours wandering around the castle and picking up new secrets
its really one great gameif you want that old school feeling draw your own map dont follow the one on the screen and make this even cooler
if you have time to burn this is your game its amazingthis is perhaps the best castlevania game ever made
i remember purchasing this game when it first came out about yrs ago and i have to admit this was video game crack for me
the moment i started playing it i just could not stop playing it
one friday night i started playing it around pm and did not stop until  am on saturday morning took about a  hr break and then i was up again playing this game until i finally finished it that saturday afternoonyouve no doubt heard all of the glowing reviews of this game
so heres another the gameplay graphics and sound are all topnotch and leagues above all those other d games
there is no excuse for not owning this even if you didnt like other castlevania games
people should get a playstation for this game its so good
its just too bad that most people will right it off because its quotoldfashionedquot
even worse it hasnt sold well so a true d sequel isnt too likely to happenfor a two dimentional game you wont find one better
this game has a great storyline exceptional graphics awesome sound effects yada yada yadayou will not regret playing this game even if you dont play games that often
this game will hook you within the first ten minutes
the only thing that could prove me wrong is if you dont want to take the time to read what some of the articles actually do once you pick them up
you have to constantly decide what to wear and what to usei recommend this game to anyone of any age
although it has some nudity  blood i think its tame enough and reminiscent of the original era that its more education than anything for youngsters under   the music is probably one of the major perks
ive downloaded and listened to the music on mp players driving around because its that good
the gameplay is simple as can be  sidescroller jump attack item and magic
there are literally hundreds of weapons armor etc items to find its amazing what some of the more rare special weaps do
the game itself is pretty long too once you beat it you beat it again upside down and all monstersmusicitems are changed to reflect your stronger levelsanyway theres lots and lots to describe of how awesome this game is
if youve never played it i pity youno other series quite conjures the atmosphere associated with konamis castlevania series
hearkening back to the days of the original castlevania on the nes the combination of classic monsters from frankensteins monster to the price of darkness himself coupled with a decidedly japanese feel made for quite the gameplay experience and luckily for us the classics just keep coming
the latest in the series sorry while the d castlevania games on the n are adequate they just dont carry on the tradition castlevania symphony of the night is the first to not feature a whip weilding member of the belmont clan as its protagonist but rather the alltoovampiric son of dracula alucard last seen helping trevor belmont in castlevania iii on the nes
playing more like castlevania  simons quest or even super metroid on the snes symphony of the night adds some rpg elements like the ability to gain in strength by levelling up equipping items and an occasional npc
while the gameplay is a bit different than previous games this is a good thing as it adds depth to the already tried and true play mechanics of the seriesthe first thing youll notice upon beginning alucards quest is that this is not your usual castlevania title
more closely resembling castlevania ii simons quest nes or to be quite honest super metroid snes sotn sprinkles the tried and true play mechanics with a good many rpg elements
the ability to equip multiple items weapons armor items etc
 level up to gain strength and the ability to purchase potions maps and other items even conversing with the occasional npc namely maria are all typical to rpgs and their addition to the castlevania formula results in a game thats very much more than the sum of its parts
draculas castle and the catacombs underneath are a huge area to navigate requiring some time in the early going youll soon open warp portals to speed your quest later and as such the map is invaluable as far as finding areas you have yet to explore again they took it straight out of super metroid
the thing is that to unlock certain areas youll need to acquire items or abilities
indeed the true challenge in sotn is not only defeating dracula but being able to explore the entire castle both normal and inverted
and lest you think all this will be a tedious chore let me assure you that controlling alucard is a small pleasure in itself
while his movement is very fluid he controls wonderfully and while it will be second nature to any castlevania fan within movements the additions of certain spells to alucards repertoire make mastery a bit more involving
and for those who would rather control a belmont richter is selectable later on by code although the going is considerably tougher for him
konami could not have delivered a more complete experiencewhile i refrain from calling castlevania symphony of the night the playstations best game in the face of games like final fantasy vii metal gear solid amp xenogears i must admit that if i was forced to choose but one it may very well be it
i will say that it is an amazing title in all aspects and sadly as things seem to be unfolding perhaps the last d castlevania title
the latest two castlevania games both on n have been in d and to be honest quite lackluster
as fate would have it the only other known castlevania title in development is also in d this time for dreamcast and while i can only hope it can recapture in some small way the splendor that is sotn one has to suspect that the inherent problems with the titles is that they are not d which is the soul of the series
if you want a post bit title that is truly castlevania there is only one route to take and that is symphony of the night or the saturn import version known as nocturne in the moonlight which actually has a couple of extra areas and a playable mariadie monster
you dont belong in this world
this was the sort of reaction many longterm series fans gave konami circa  when they first attempted to bring the castlevania series into a d world on the n
it wasnt a much better reception a few years later either when lament of innocence  curse of darkness both arrived on the ps
even though the rest of the world opted to go into d gaming because it was the cool new thing back in the s few companies such as konami  capcom stuck to their guns and kept pumping out some amazing new new at the time bit generation d titles and the mighty symphony of the night stood as the proud flagship and proof that d gaming is here to stay no matter what the trends are
wait a moment
you look familiar
and yet what do you here
sporting tons of monsters rpg elements outstanding artwork supermetroid style gameplay a killer soundtrack and huge areas to explore as well as the other castle later on symphony took most of the best elements of previous castlevanias gave the series a massive overhaul in the structural and aesthetic departments and started what is essentially the nd generation of castlevania games
to this day it remains a gorgeous feast to the eyes ears and gaming experience that does in fact stand the test of time
although at the time it appeared that this would be the big hurrah of d vampire hunting that is until the gba arrived years later heeding the cries for more symphonyit was not by myteam symphonys hand that i am once again given flesh i was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute
tribute in the form of circle of the moon
more titles arrived soon afterward such as harmony aria dawn portrait and the recent excelsia all of them spectacular in their own right and yet still they borrowed heavily from symphonys style making this one the granddaddy of classic metroidvaniastribute
you steal mens souls and make them your slaveswell
im not a slave to symphony exactly but ill admit this ones quickly become my favorite d game of all time due to the fact that i can keep coming back to it year after year and still find something new and fun about the game try collecting all the rare items
so i suppose it has stolen my soul
and while i can certainly see how newer generations of gamers could find so much to nitpick about it this one remains a classic in my eyes all bumps involved
so lets get the cons out of the way yes most of the voice acting is terrible
yes the dialogue is cheesy as hell
yes the games difficulty could be a little more challenging
yes the other castle is essentially the first one upside down
no you cant get rid of all the inventory clutter of old items to make equipping items easier
but all in all the gameplay stays amazing as its ever had in the series and a style that many gamers now follow to this day
perhaps the same could be said of all religionscontrolling alucard and richter is as fun and fluid as ever eliminating all the oh no
moments from previous games where managing your jumping direction was much more difficult
the animation of your character the monsters the castle details and even some of the d backgrounds are top notch for the ps as well
definitely a labor of love
with all the special powers relics  moves you can acquire throughout the game you can turn your halfvampirehalfhuman from a simple dagger wielder to a force to be reckoned with
and by the time you reach your father dracula you too along with richter will shout outyour words are as empty as your soul
mankind ill needs a savior such as you
and yes for the first time in the series aside from his small playable role in castlevania iii you get to control draculas son
but when the belmonts are essentially nowhere to be found upon draculas arrival and thus less whip cracking this time around mankind seriously needs a savior such as alucard to pick up the slack and put his father along with death succubus and the dark priest shaft back in their places
richter brought dracula down years earlier but its up to alucard to figure out why richter disappeared as well
and soevil can only triumph when good men do nothing
and that leaves us with just one more questionwhat is a manmetroidvania
a miserable little pile of secretssecrets
there are lots of secrets
but this adventure is also an amazing ride into gaming history nonetheless
if you dig the metroid style d gaming of the newer titles or just any game like this period then i highly recommend you pick up this game in any form you can
its also available on the psp release castlevania the dracula x chronicles and xbox live arcade thus eliminating the need to hunt down the original for high prices  update i learned that the voice acting changed in dracula x chronicles for the worse
so its your call
i also suggest if you havent played them alreadycircle of the moon gbaharmony of dissonance gbaaria of sorrow gbadawn of sorrow dsportrait of ruin dsorder of excelsia dsmetroid zero mission gbametroid fusion gbasuper metroid snesbut enough talk have at youcastlevaina symphony of the night  circa good greattight controls very large d world to explore hundreds of different enemies to battle hundreds of items and secrets to findbad graphics might seem dated to some voice acting is not that greatif it fits your taste multiple endings a nonliner d side scrolling action rpg old school platforming in a nonliner worldgame its most assocated too super metriod castlevaina x japanese version for the pc
not the us version on snesadditional notes put your disc in the cd player and play track  for a bonus music track in the castlevina time line this game takes place after castlevaina dracula x on super nintendo the first part of the game states final stage blood lines this is a recap of the last stage of castlevaina dracula x but to many it seems as if its the last stage in castlevaina blood lines on sega genesis because the level is called blood lines
note blood lines is in reference to the blood line dracula and alucard share and not the game for sega genesis there is an extended version of this game for sega saturn after beating the game in a certain way you open up a bonus world which really is just an upside down version of the previous world this game is now on xbox live arcade
it was the first xbox live arcade title to exceed the mb limit restriction because of this game the limit has been increased to mb
the download comes with an hd version of the game sotn now in widescreen
and a original unfiltered port of the game
as well as xbox live achievements  in all
it sells for  points or  usd konami also announced a port of symphony of the night will be included in castlevania the dracula x chronicles for the sony psp
this version will be packed with a copy of the japanese castlevaina dracula x which was never put out in america before as well as a total remake of castlevaina dracula x in d but still plays like the d version this psp version of sotn will feature full screen graphics as well as a touched up localization in terms of all new voice actingin my opionion this is the best castlevania out there
this is a d game with some nice d backgrounds
you have alot of different weapons spells and other helpful items that lend support in your long journey
the enemies are very cool to look at nice animation however that doesnt stop you from wanting to shead much blood
the game carries a quottquot for quotteen rating
there is quite a bit of blood in the game which is cool
im telling you right now and many of you know thiscastlevania symphony of the night is huge
you will have to back track alot in the game
with that being said i will also say that even though you do alot of back tracking the game never feels repetitious
the gameplay gets a  without a second thought
if you own a ps dust it off and buy this masterpiececastlevania symphony of the night is a great example of how sequels should be done
even though alucard uses a sword instead of the traditional whip the game seems  worthy of the castlevania title dont worry though if you prefer the whip style of play you can play through the entire game with richter once you have completed certain tasks
the gameplay is tight and refined the graphics are wonderful theres tons of items and rooms to find and the music fits each section of the game perfectly
the  castles to explore are massive but a teleportation system keeps you from having to back track the whole way by foot to get to a desired area
every feature in this game was obviously paid close attention to by konami
fans of the castlevania series will not be let down
this is a true classic that every playstation owner should havewhen i was a wee lad i played board games collect four hungry hippo monopoly
they were fun diversions i was later amazed by the prospect of playing game like pac man dig dug ect in arcades yah i know im old
i remember the simple days and it makes my mind wobble how complex and utterly craptastic videogames have become today ive been a gamer pretty much all my life
so i know how sometimes its best too keep a game simple and fun rather then just ruin it by making it too complexcastlevania manages too find a perfect balance between the simple and complex
it mixes the old run jump smack a monster medusa head gameplay with street fighter like spells and wait until you see some of these bosses some are admittedly lame others will put your gaming skills too the test
but its best feature is the awesome design of the castle and how the developers placed the power upssuper metroid has been called one of the if not the most well designed game of all time
the bosses were big and frightening
the map was desgined with the powerups placed in just such a way that when you found one powerup it gave you the ability too enter an previously unreachable area theres a certain rewarding thrill behind playing a game with this design and the developers are either fans of that design are worked on super metroid themselves
cuz it not only follows that formula but builds upon it in every waywhen you first start the game there will be all sorts of paths for you too follow but apparently the archtect of castlevania is a sick joker cuz even with your supernatural powers you just cant seem too reach these paths
but alter in the game after alot of adventuring fighting and finding all sorts of goodies you will either find what you need too reach that unreachable platform or wind up on the other side of it through you journeys
and rest assured its a fun tripthe powerups are all cool and fun too use my fave is the mist spell
that lets your charachter turn into a fog
your enemies cant touch you when your transformed so you can just pass through them and attack thier backs
others like changing into a bat wolf or being able too super jump or wear armor that breaks spikes are all fun too use that has too be played too truly understandand as for the story well it wont win a oscar but its pretty cool
the last belmont kicks the stuffing outta drac in the beginning of the game then after four years of friday night poker games and having a wench in every town he disappears
and wouldnt ya know it about the same time that fun haunted house that we all know and love as castlevania reappears out of the mist
richters sis maria puts  and  together goes too find him
apparently he owes her money or something p  the half human son of dracula whos supposed too be locked in an eternal sleep wakes up after  years
after going too the nearest tailor too get some hip clothes and a much needed bath he heads out for castlevania as well
sword in hand and ready too kick booty of course thats just the opening the rest of the story is pretty decent
i liked how death and allucard had somewhat of a repore
death seemed at first reluctant too fight him even gave him a chance too go back but when allucard refuses too renounce his quest of patricide the whuppin begins
moments like these and many others like it give some more depth too the world of castlevaniai could go on and on this is a game that has a simple premise but manages too weave in so many complex elements all fun yet never loses the simplicity
games were meant too be simple
a fun distraction from the hectic pace of life
the video gaming industry has grown into such a massive beast over the past few years
its no longer a niche hobby
and such there is a high financial demand for innovation
but sometimes innovation comes at the cost of fun
castlevania sotn manages too retain the simplicity of the old days while having innovations up the kazoo
thats why so many people have scuh strong feelings for it today
i would reccommend this too anyone that likes videogames or wants too start playing them
solid snake is cool and all but allucard just has more style
if they ever making a fighting game centred around the coolest video game charachter ever expect too see these two in the finalsof course thats just my opinon
i could be wrong
pcastlevania has been around since the original nes
we have played as countless belmonts earned countless powerups and destroyed draculas on countless occasions
now the castle is back and to the rescue come alucard an acient vampire slayer with a shocking past
the castle is huge the action is huge and the enemies are hugethroughout some of the more recent installments of castlevania there have been several different powers to acquire
whether those be magical cards or the collection of souls its been around
in this installment alucard collects relics
these relics can do anything from allow you to jump twice in midair to summon a ghost to help you in your battle through the castle
the relics are all nicely organized uin the pause menu and are easily tuned on and off with the simple touch of a buttonanother great addition to sotn is the spells
you are able to buy magic scrolls from the merchant which contain button combinations of how to perform different spells
everything from health regeneration to summoning souls for a quick attack on the enemy with ease
with this merchant comes my one and only gripe
in this game you only have the choice to sell of different gems zircon aquamarine garnet and so on
toward the end of the game a relic which duplicates any item use becomes available the only problem
its  dollars
seeign that the most valuable gem the diamond only pulls  bucks it takes quite a logn time to find all the money for this item
i thought being able to sell off old useless weapons armor and accesories would have helped this problem a long a bit better than simply wandering the castle for cashin conclusion it is impossible to talk about the plot of this game and not give anything away so you will just have to play it
take it from me a person who has been collecting videogames for years and years this game is going to attain a very high price tag in not very long
the original version can go for upward of  dollars and ive even seen the greatest hit version for 
its a great expierience you wont be able to put down great for the actionrpg junkiecastlevania symphony of the night is a masterpiece
thats all i can really say about this game
the animation is great the enemies are imaginative and varied the controls are quick and responsive the exploration is fun i only have one complaint and thats with the terrible terrible voice acting
but even that gains a certain amount of charm and will bring a oh thats so bad
smile to your facethere were two things that struck me the most in this game
the first is the art
appropiately gothic macabre moody dark ornate and beautiful
i always looked around in amazement at the sections of the castle as i explored its seemingly infinite corridors
the animation for your main character and your enemies is fluid nuanced and wonderful to look at
and unlike many games from the ps era hold up fantastically todaythe second aspect that still wows is the games music
from jazz to classical to rock the games soundtrack is varied and always will get stuck in your head
it is moody desolate exciting and mysterious at all the right timesthere is one thing that i did dislike about the game
that had to do with the exploration of the castl
things are fine and dandy when youre finding new places to go and new enemies to fight but eventually youll get stuck
and inevitably youll be roaming the same halls over and over again until you discover that secret room or new ability that will allow you to progress
while not gamebreaking i did have to just stop playing because i was tired of making no progress give it a while and then go back to it with fresh eyesif you have a psp or a ps download it from the playstation store
or on xbox live you can download a highdefinition version of the game
if you liked shadow complex or metroid fusionzero mission this game is right up your alley
do yourself a favor and get itthis grows on in and around your consciousness
castlevania sotn is bliss a heavenly escape from life
transcending mere fun this game becomes a way of hour life maybe not so long but one joyous ride
corny voice acting gives a lighthearted twist to the intended serious story but thats hardly enough to detract from the uncut fun
if you enjoy hybrids ive counted these genres platform action adventure and rpg one heady mix and need nonstop action from your games castlevania should have long ago been yoursthere are only a handful of games that i will play multiple times and castlevania symphony of the nightsotnis one of those games
this game is so addictive so fun and so diverse that i have played through it about  times and still am not bored with the game
in fact i wore my original copy out so that it had scratches on it so i had to go online and purchase a brand new copy
anyways this game combines classic castlevania d elements side scrolling combat rpg relics and equipment and a great magical and battle system all into one game
furthermore you get to play as alucard who first appeared as an optional character in the nes game castlevania  draculas cursethe graphics in this game are simply amazing and are probably the best dimensional graphics ever produced in a game
the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and makes the gameplay even more fun  many of the tracks fit the environemnts and castle sections perfectly so it really adds a great dimension to the game
the gameplay is excellent
there is just so much variety and so much equipment that it is hard to get bored or to experiment with everything
you can alucard with countless swords and armors learn magical spells and collect numerous relics that will allow alucard to transform into a bat wolf or mist
eventually alucard can learn additional skills which will allow him to attack in those forms so well
the castle itself is large and has a lot to explore with many different enemies to fight
moreover the replay value is great because you can play through as richter once you beat the game and even if you want to play through as alucard again there are always new itmes to findthe only negative thing i have to say about this game and a very small and minor thing it is is that the voice acting is very substandard
yet even this element brings a certain charm and likeable quality to the game that i really dont think i would change
trust me this is one outstanding game and one no one should go without in their playstation library
if you dont own a copy look at used game retailers for a used copy
if that fails search online at auction retailers or other locations until you find a copy of castlevania sotn
believe me you wont be dissappointedthe good  the music graphics level design difficulty the weaponsarmor the bosses shear size of the world
the best in d gamingthe bad  perhaps the worst voice acting everwhen people talk about the greatest game for the psx most people will probably tell you final fantasy vii or something like that
but i always think of castlevania symphony of the night
by far this is the greatest d platformer to ever grace the gaming world and there is no castlevania better than symphony of the nightthe game begins in  with richter belmont going into battle with dracula
after richter emerges victorious and banishes dracula the mysterious castle disappears
but a year afterwards richter suddenly vanishes
maria a close friend of his sets out to find him and out of nowhere castlevania the home of dracula appears out of nowhereyou play as alucard the son of dracula who rushes into castlevania when it appears in order to destroy it and prevent dracula from returningits a very simple story but its an actionadventure game
the game also throws in some rpg elements
unlike the past castlevania games youre character now levels up and can equip weapons and armor
alucard also doesnt use the trademark whip like the belmonts used to
you actually use a sword in one hand and you can even have a different weapon in another
the game also presents a super metroid style map that you will use as you explore the castle looking for bosses to defeat and finding all of your abilities to take on draculalike the classic games youve got subweapons that use hearts
each weapon has its advantages and disadvantages
for example the throwing knives can be used for long range attacks but are fairly weak
the holy cross does tons of damage but cost a lot of heartsyou also have relics that you either find lying around or get from defeating bosses
these relics help alucard out and enhance his abilities
you can use some relics to help you turn into a wolf turn into a bat or a cloud of mist
there is also a relic that lets you summon an ally known as a familiar by your sideyou can also use spells to hinder your skills
the spells are done with a dpad combinationthe visual look and feel of this game is astonishing
a d game has never looked this good
even so many years later the graphics look really good
some are a tad bit fuzzy but youll quickly get over thatthe music is perhaps the best part about castlevania sotn
the tunes are addicting and youll be humming them for a while
the tunes were so good that i found myself just standing around in one area just so i could enjoy the musicthe game also throws in a twist halfway through
once youre done exploring the first castle youll go to a reverse castle in which everything is upside down
the game also has four different endingsthis is perhaps the best playstation game of all time
it is the best castlevania hands down with the excellent circle of the moon coming in second and is the most breathtaking in the seriescastlevania symphony of the night is simply put a masterpiece
the classic side scrolling action is very well done as is the use of spells and the power to equip use secret uses for equipment weapon ex
with some weapons they have a special attack that can be executed with left leftdown down rightdown right or vice versa
accessories ex
with the gravity boots if you press down up and then x jump you rocket into the air to dizzying heights
the gameplay is smooth unless you encounter many enemies with graphically impressive attacks at which point the action lags
the castle is huge not to mention once you beat the game the first castle theres still half of the game left the inverted castle
when you complete the whole game you recieve passwords to obtain special abilities in your next game
this game is not linear
you basically choose your route through the castle
lets not forget the amazing soundtrack
the boss fights however need mentioning do to their either very easy or very hard state
dracula the final boss is a cakewalk but dont let that determine your purchase
the game itself is of medium length but the amount of extra stuff to do allowed me to clock in around  hours on my first run most time was spent exploring and training the game takes maybe  hours
needless to say i still play the game  years from its release
buy immediatelyquite frankly you are smoking rocks if this game doesnt become one of the most pleasantly infectious gaming memories of your life
i should really hate this game for the hundreds of hours it has managed to detract me from doing things society would label as important
i love this game more than my mom and ive told that to her face
even if you dont end up liking this game i believe everybody owes it to themselves to try it outwith that said this game is poetry in motion
from the music to the artwork everything is simply a pleasure for the senses and when coupled with solid simplistic and fun gameplay you really cant arguethe game has a sprite based watercolor feel to it and you arent going to find an artistic direction like this in many other games because the lead character designer on this game ayami kojima is entirely self trained
the art is perfect for this game though
from the most obvious to the smallest detail you are in draculas castle
nothing feels out of place
my only gripe here is that if you arent playing the game on an overclocked saturn then youre going to experience some lag when a lot is going on meaning that sometimes they were a little too ambitious with their workthe music sets the mood perfectly in this game
i kind of like video game music from time to time but i own this album and listen to it regularly
the music can be serene and creepy for underground areas or drive powerful metal guitar riffs for those more intense moments
again everything is paired perfectly environments and music and not a single area rubs you the wrong way
theres also a hidden music track on this game if you put it in to a cd player which is kind of funny so check it outthe gameplay whats not to like here
taking everything cool about rpgs and pairing it flawlessly with everything good about actionplatforming games
the controls are solid you can belt spells out street fighter style at a moments notice or backdash for dodging without thinking about it
my only gripe is that the game can be super easy once you know what youre doing but i really dont care because the game is such a joy to playits not necessarily obvious upon completing the game but there are tons of replay modes and different endings to get
you can play through with a different character and several different sets of starting stats by entering a different name when you start the game
there are also certain items like the duplicator that are only available after you have cleared the game oncei could go on for days about the pleasures of this game but ive told you what you need to know
with this game now being on the  arcade and supposedly coming out on the psp there is no excuse not to play it
i dream of the day when a true console sequel is made for this game with guilty gear isuka quality graphics droolthis game is by far one of the best castlevania game in the franchise
super catslevania iv is my personal favorite but this one is definitely tied for nd place along with aria of sorrow on the gameboy advance
yes sotn was the first game to begin the so called metroidvania phase but the game itself is spectacular
even if you enjoy the more linear point a to point b style of the original castlevania games outside of simons questyou should really enjoy the more open world feel that this style brings to the table
this game will challenge you to a point of frustration but will keep you coming back again and again
the music is great the enemies are unique and there are so many subweapons and powerups to keep this game fresh
i will continue to play and replay this one again and againthroughout castlevanias history there have been only three thus far that did not follow the mainstream pattern
those were castlvania  simons quest nes castlevania circle of the moon gba and castlevania symphony of the night
what seperated these three titles from the rest of the series
they were action rpg not mainstream action gamescastlevania symphony of the night is the second approach at the rpg format
this time however you are not a belmont instead the last one to this point richter has mysteriously vanished around the same time that castle dracula has reemerged
maria goes in search of richter and thats where you come inyou play alucard a half vampire half human
alucard was last seen fighing alongside trevor belmont grant dynasty and sypha belanade in castlevania  the prequal to the first game but not the earliest belmont
these three are somewhat resurected for a bossfight
alucard has reawaken to fight his father and put his cursed bloodline to rest
after being stripped of his items early on you must explore castle dracula for clues as to what happened to richter and put an end to draculagraphically this game is a wonder
easily one of the best psx games of all time psm rated this  for the top  psx games
it is gasp d almost unheard of today
in truth however that made this game even more fun and graphically amazing than beforehowever what truely stands out is the music
never has a castlevania game had such outstanding music than this
it is amazing and a wonder to ownin the end this is a definite keeper
the only way not to like this is if you are either a devoted follower to d games or dont like castlevania
buy this now i command you toso much has already been said about this game
one of the best and most riveting games on the psx
at the end of the castle there is a surprise waiting for you
i will not spoil itthe graphics are impressive for its time as well as the animation and control
the music and sounds fit the subject very welldefinitely a game worth while getting and playing
fun orignal and not to be missed
a game to be passed down or willed to a family member to try and describe a game like sotn is near impossible
think of it as an onion that as a gamer you will peel away at for years
the creators of this masterpiece were either obsessive compulsive designers hell bent on blowing the minds of the gaming world or mad geniuses creating a masterpiece the same way picasso brought a painting into existence
no other game that exists today can match the depth and scope of this marvelif you are new to sotn dont dismiss it outright look into and admire the richness of it like someone would a fine winethis is the pinnacle of the glory days of gaming a polished gem that is the essence of videogamingno game since has come close to touching itsymphony is just a terrific game
it leaves anything before it and many knock offs after it in the dirt
alucard is not a whip slinging goof not that the first two castelvania games were bad in any respect
this just turns everything up several notches
a huge amount of items armor and weapons to use
including some upgrades favorites the axe holy water boomerang new stuff like familliars little critters who have special powers and will be a huge help to alucard an rpg level up system so you are able to take on the nasty beast that dracula throws at you
i have played this for years
and will continue to do so huge amount of replay value just because of how beautiful it is
just go get it oh and a strategy guide or youll be up poop creekexploration
gothic theme
powerups
great music
perfect pacing
lots of items
huge variety of enemies
secret areas
well made puzzlesi really love the ambiance of this game
from the very start this world is just dripping with grit
the boss fights arent too tough but if youre like me you like feeling overpowered
additionally this game has several play modes
i dont want to spoil anything but you can play as people other than alucard
or as a modified alucard must must must buy
that is if you like castlevania gamescastlevania symphony of the night harkens back to the early and great castlevanias of the old nes but with vastly updated graphics gameplay and even ambiance
sure its still a d scroller where you roam around and jump around on platforms and what not but its at the top of the heap
the game starts somewhat oddly with you as a vampire hunter facing off against dracula in a fairly wacky fight that always reminds me of a pro wrestling match
you beat dracula at which point time warps ahead and you switch to alucard draculas remorseful son spell alucard backwardsyah clever who brings the fight to draculas vast and labyrinthe castle in an effort to do away with his evil sire for all time
at first i was put off by what i thought was a bizarre and inelegant introduction the human vampire hunter is a character from one of the mediocre middle castlevania games and is very unwieldy but it turns out the manner in which you use him to defeat dracula historically in the plot affects alucards starting abilities
meaning if you beat up on drakula with magic alucard later favors magic
ditto for melee combatanyway the game is lush and filled with endless amounts of loot
any monster has a chance to drop rare goodies when slain based on alucards luck stat fake walls crumble to reveal hidden platemail accidentallytripped switches open bookcases or trapdoors and zillions of types of monsters appear from all over the place
the music is great and quite haunting and the games rpg and money system are quite well developed
alucard has quick combo spells you can use while fighting and many of the weapons shields and armors he finds have their own effects which have to be discovered in game play
ive located weapons that let alucard teleport summon the undead to fight for him call lightning ice or fire or even waves of holy light down on his foes
everything from helms to circlets to rings to boots can be worn and alucard eventually even develops the ability to transform into traditional vampire modes
dissipate into a swirling cloud of mist and waft through a ceiling vent to escape your enemies turn into a wolf and charge through crowds of zombies or transform into a bat and fly around breathing fire on everyone
lastly alucard collects various magical relics throughout the game that do everything from let him breathe underwater to have permament familiars that float around with him on screen and help him out the dancing runesword is not to be missed
as an example of the thought put into this game your familiars themselves even gain experience and go up levels growing both stronger and smarter over time
for example the runesword familiar at first just kinda floats along behind you lethargically swinging at things long after they took a bite out of you
but after a while it turns into a gleaming heat seeking weapon of vengeance mercilessly smiting anything the second it shows up on screen
at one point i turned alucard into mist and just drifted around while the sword familiar took out a boss for me
this game also has more items and secrets in it than your average final fantasy and is more addictive
it is also one of the least frustrating games you can find you can save as often as you want in save rooms you find on your map in a coffin natch heal yourself easily and as a vampire youre more than a match for the sluggish beasts you meet early on
the challenge of the game comes from an easy balance of combat and puzzle solving rather than a heavy reliance on one or the otherlastly and most entertainingly the bosses in this game are amazing
unlike earlier side scrollers where the game progressed through levels in symphony of the night you simply roam around an enormous mazelike castle
you never know when suddenly a steel grate will drop behind you and youll find yourself trapped in a fight with oh a grotesque giant mummy suspended on steel hooks that takes up  screens worth of animation
thats just the sort of thing thats worth the price of admissioncastlevania symphony of the night is quite simply the best game for the playstation and certainly one of the best games of all time
it has all the things that make a game great challenging battles crisp graphics hidden secrets an enchantingly spooky score and an exciting background storyyou play alucard a blood relative of the evil dracula in your quest to put the evil of your family line to rest
most castlevania games feature whipwielding belmonts as the main character but trust me  alucard is the ultimate video game hero
his aloof yet admirable personality sword skills and awesome appearance make him a hero that you can truly be proud to play as
alucard is a major contributor to the trend in good video games to make a more complex protagonistthe most fun you will have playing this game is trying to get a higher percentage of the game complete by uncovering other parts of the map a feature castlevania developers have used in almost every game since sotn
you saw it here first
after completing the first part of the game you are thrown a curveball the upsidedown castle
sotn was so revolutionary in its level design yet it feels so natural to play
it is the most polished d game ever madegranted this game  which is part of a series of loosely connected games based on vampire myths  does not have the best or most consistent story of any game not even any action game
the basic progression of events will not surprise you or bring you to tears
what will bring you to tears is the happiness you take away from you when you beat a boss find something new or complete the game
konami mastered the art of d gaming in castlevania sotn and with the age of alld gaming even in konamis planned sotn sequel it is safe to say sotn will remain the best game of its kind
no gamer is complete without iti remember way back when the playstation first came out a friend of mine only had a demo of this game because the actual game wasnt going to come out for a few months
the demo featured one ship on the first track for one lap and you had to wait for it to load every time
i must have played it a million times
i actually got to the point where i could get in third place on the first lapwhere am i going with this you ask
well i have probably played more racing games in my life than any other kind of game
i have played pretty much every kind of racing game in existance from gran turismo and rage racer on playstation to hydro thunder and star wars episode pod racer on dreamcast fron diddy kong on n to fzero and mario kart on super nintendo
and i am here to tell you that this one of the best racing games ever made not just on playstation but on any systemfirst there is the graphics
yes they have drawin yes they are lowres compared to most games today
but you know what these graphics are better than those found in most games made today
how can that be
simply because the graphics have what is missing from so many other games style
and lets not forget that each track in the game looks vastly different in raptor league from how it looks in venom league playing at a different time of day means completely different lighting and the lighting looks amazing
despite its age this is a beautiful game
from the martian red sky to the farnorth crystal course this game is wonderful to watchthen there is the control
some have complained about the control saying it feels too quotfloatyquot
but you know what
its a hovercraft
its supposed to feel that way
once you get the hang of it you grow to love it
it took me a long long time to be able to play this game in firstperson mode
every time you hit the wall the camera goes sideways disorienting you
but once you get used to controlling the hovercraft in firstperson mode you feel like youve attained a new level of racing skill and the game becomes that much more funsound in this game is awesome
your craft has a cool engine sound and the voice telling you youve about to get hit by a missile is classic
but what really blows my mind is the soundtrack
it is my favorite game soundtrack of all time
i copied the whole thing off of the game and burned it onto a cd because its so great
and when i first ripped it off the cd onto my hard drive people were downloading the tracks like crazy
imagine thatthe thing which seperates a great game from a good one is replay value
this game has replay value like you wouldnt believe
ive owned it for years
yet every once in a while i simply must go for a spin down one of the tracks
the music the graphics the controlspefect
this game is a work of art
the best thing to every come from psygnosis and in my opinion the best game in the series
if you love racing games youll buy this one and guard it with you lifeits a fun game
you play as a gloveand he has to get all the crystals
if i am correct there is  worldsareas
its a fun game
im sad they never released glover 
glover  got cancelledthis game can be either really easy or really hard depending on the settings the player chooses
there are two settings that really matter in terms of difficulty difficulty level and control type
difficulty level determines how hard it is to take out enemy planes how easily you get shot down and how hard it is to evade enemy missiles
control type is found in the options menu when you select a mission and has an even bigger effect
with the novice defalt controls your plane automatically turns back to level after turns and you cant control yaw rotational turn left and right or invert
on expert mode you can do anything barrel roll reverse illemans real break turns etc
the latter makes the already difficult levels nearly impossible except for dogfights which are much easier with expert controls
secondly the levels are incredibly detailed at one point you fly into an enemy base that is in caverns in a mountain
it feels like mission impossible
finally i dont know what people are talking about when they say that the plane you choose doesnt matter
it does
just trust me
i would recommend this game to almost anyone
it does a good job of making levels hard for better replay value and allows you to some crazy moves with experts controls
its best trait is that you can play it on two different levels a planebased shootemup or a combat intensive flightsimair force delta is one of the sweetest games on the dreamcast
the graphics are not great but they are cool and more than get the job done
the varing missions keep the game refreshing and exciting and add a lot of replay value
the music is not worthy of a seperate cd soundtrack but it is good for the game
there are tons of planes to buy which add some depth to the game because you have to choose a good plane for the various missionsis you want a great flying experience for the dreamcast look no furtheri really like this game here
sure its a little cheesy but the graphics make up for it
they are very colorful and are such a nice departure from the dark and gloomy resident evil type locals
i would describe it as resident evil in a chrono cross setting very tropicalthough some will tell you that xl is the best xl doesnt have analog support
and besides the tracks in  are just hard enough
and the female voice of your ships computer is helpful while not being irritating
the music is great and like some psone games you can drop it into your computer and rip it
chemical brothers  under the influence is probably my favorite song on thisid reccomend this over wipeout fusion because fusion didnt really get the controls down  and the tracks arent well balanced
wipeout  is about as fast and hectic as you can getwhen i think of this game in my head i hear the female computer voice say force wallthis may not be a gigantic leap over the nearflawless wipeout xl but as they say if it aint broke dont fix it
in fact with the addition of challenge modes as well as the return of the tournament mode wipeout  is the most complete game of the   graphics are incredibly smooth and fast as usual with little to none of that background quotpopinquot that plagued the first two
the ships look a little like lego though
wipeouts claim to fame other than vomitinducing speed has always been its pulsing soundtrack and this time around it can be the best of the  chemical brothers influence and sashas xpander but it can also be the worst an uncharacteristically weak tune from orbital and the rest of sashas contributions
no fear though because the gameplay has been relatively untouched
the biggest new feature is the hyperthrust
the r button sacrifices shield energy for a little extra speed which minimizes the loss of speed from hitting the wall believe me you will hit the wall
there are some new weapons including the force wall and energy drain but no turbo boostsob
its also important to mention that combat plays a much larger role in this outing
it can mean the difference between st and th
i havent stuck with it for exceptionally long but ive noticed that it is much harder to win in this game except on vector which isnt how you should be playing anyway
i find that a good thing though
im now at the point where im winning the venom circuits but still struggling to win gold with the rapier class
i also like the idea that you start with  tracks and  ships but if you win enough races youll end up with  tracks check out the manor top and  ships icaras is a treat
it can be frustrating finishing th all the time but the reward of finally winning is worth the effort
if youre a fan of the wipeout series you probably are if youre reading this then wipeout  is just as good as any other
if wipeout has never really appealed to you then you should save your money this time around too for a shrinkwipeout  was a great way to get into the franchise because it has the best of what the previous games offered plus a little more
the graphics got some serious update since wipeout  and the gameplay is a lot smoother and faster
add to that a killer soundtrack and some nice little extras and this game is an obvious choice for any arcade racing fanfirst of all the racing is just plain fun
frame rate is very smooth and the tracks are varied and challenging
if youre not familiar with wipeout at all then think of it as a scifi racing game
youre racing on an antigravity sled thingy thats not only built for speed but armed to take out your opponents the dirty way by either slowing them down with a land mine or completely trashing their vehicle with a guided missile
just keep in mind the other racers can do the same
so you have a combination of racing and a little tactical combat as wellthere are some tweaks and improvements from the last games but the one im going to focus on is the instant replay
this is a very cool feature that lets you see the race you just finished from the cameramans point of view
you see yourself racing past the crowds and screaming around curves or crashing against the side rails depending on your performance as if you were watching the race on tv
neat featurethe soundtrack is the best of the series with wipeout fusion a close second
many people prefer wipeout s soundtrack because it has different and eclectic styles of electronica
to me however w has all the songs built for speed
you get a whos who of artists like chemical brothers orbital underworld propellerheads dj sasha and more
for nothing else get this game for the cool soundtrackconsidering the price of the game today you would be crazy not to buy it even for just the soundtrack which you can rip from the game cd
i have played it on my ps with no problems and the gameplay still keeps me coming back
arcade race fans this game is a winnerat this point ive played every wipeout game ever made except two
wipeout pure for the psp and wipeout hd for the playstation  while fusion was kinda neat in a couple of ways and  was fun the real mustowns were definitely wipeout wipeout xl and wipeout the first game was slick and pretty and had a beautiful soundtrack the second was fast beyond all belief let you blow up the competition and had music that was a lot more intense and so were the weapons
the third game isdifferent but still very very goodthe first two games had slick presentation to be sure but it cant touch this game
the whole designer republic thing has just been kicked into overdrive and everything has that very simplified futuristic superclean supersimple look
kinda like pn
 different
but for menus still nice except for the fact that you cant read the tech specs on the vehicles because the text is illegible ugh
the track graphics on the other hand are like taking the pretty graphics of the first game accelerating them to near the levels of the second game and running everything through a graphical filter that makes them look like the style of need for speed  high risk or r ridge racer  again different
on the whole though i love the graphics
they feature lots of animations like birds taking off or aircraft flying by and are very detailed and smooth and just pleasant and soothing to look at less sharp edges and dark moody atmosphere and more happy pastel colorsthe weapons are combination of old and some new with the new being nothing to write home about
personally i think the weapons from the second game were the best
the craft though are probably the best of any game in the series
they are all unique but thus far ive found none of them to have what i would call a crippling shortcoming
they are all fun to use and handle very differently
sweet
the tracks feature more of the brilliant track design of the first two games so youll want to play them over and over and over
the controls are the style and feel as the previous two games but a boost function that drains your shields has been added which actually changes the way you play the game quite a bit
there are loads of tracks vehicles events ect to unlock through getting medals in all events with every kind of vehicle so the game has lots of replay value
the design of the vehicles is also pretty cool if you ask meif you liked the first two wipeout games youll love this one
the same great wipeout gameplay with new tracks new vehicles and more great unique graphics
trust me even if you dont really care for it all that much at first keep playing
it grows on you
and of course it gets a lot more exciting when you unlock the faster race classestony hawks pro skater is one of the best games on playstation
you can play as tony hawk or as one of the nine top pros
it includes signature pro moves fully skateable worlds headtohead competitions and instant  replay modes
you can play in many championships with more than   fascinating moves one of which is the madonna
skate through many worlds  including malls parks and schools
me my sister and my friends love  this game
work your way up the ranks by landing suicidal tricks in brutal  competitions to become the highestranked skate boarding champ
youll love  this game
you have to have  ithonostly people this is the best game on playstation today and will most likely take ages to outclass
i first learned of this game from a review in a magazine but i wasnt really into skateboarding so i decided to let this one slide
coincidentally my cousin brought over his dreamcast version and one night later i was off to buy this game at the nearest location possible
in this game you play as one of  of the worlds greatest pro skaters as you compete in different levels and competitions
by doing different moves on your board this is done by moving the left joystick in any direction and pressing either square or circle or triangle  square does flips circle does holds and triangle does different grindsin your skating adventures you compete to win quottapesquot which are used to unlock new boards new levels new characters and competitions
to win the tapes youve got to board your way like a pro through different levels trying to destroy certain objects beat high scores spell the word skate and by finding a hiddin tape obviously hiddin in the level
it may sound kinda simple it may sound complicatedbut trust me its all good
and even if you do manage to find someone who hates this game who could hate the great tracks of music it features from real bands
okay but heres where im gonna get picky
sometimes while pulling off moves that you need to get you that top score youll fall over on some unforeseen object or youll be goin for a quarter pipe and a car will hit you yes there are cars
but thats really gettin picky
the only other real draw back i can find is that its too addictive
trust me and buy this gametony hawks pro skater has got to sport the best replay value of any game on earth
its great because you dont have to be a fan of the sport to play  this fantastic skate boarding game
play in many different enviornmets  like skate parks for example with ramps rails and pools to all perform  fantastic high air tricks
its also nice because the learning curve is not  too great
i picked this game up and was jumping off ramps spining board  kicking and sliding down rails in no time
i just can not stop playing  tony hawks pro skater i think i may need profesional helpeverything was in good shape when it arrived
it arrived in a timely manner
it completed my set of tony hawk games for the psone
it went well with my setafter getting rid of playstation i became nostalgic about the game and decided to rebuy the game
truly the original tony hawk game cannot be beat
great classic from the late s
i would recommend this game to any gamerlets face it the graphics are awful compared to what were used to these days but even now the game is still a ton of fun and worth playing again
check out the new thps hd version on the xbox and ps for some nostalgia with better gameplaythis is the first instalment of the tony hawk series
this is the start of greatness because it allows you for the first time to become one of your favorite skateboarders
you board through great levals completing objectives and winning compatitions
this is also an awsome multiplayer game
you get to skate against your friends to get the most points or in the grafiti mode
in grafiti you see who can do the most tricks on different areas of the leval whoever claims the most territory wins
this is an all aroung great game and a must buy but the graphics could use some workfrom warehouses schools and malls to big citys and a ship tony hawks pro skater is an awesome sports game
so many moves available it has to be one of the best games i own
it has awesome features like options to save and replay your runs in any level any time you want you can do a two minute run in any level with single session and you can play in any level as long as you want in free skatealthough this game does suffer a little bit of damage
the first mistake is the lack of challange up to the sixth levelst level warehouse  way too easy i got all five tapes in one turnnd level school  simple if you cant get all five tapes then theres something wrong with yourd level mall  easy as well took a few trys to get the secret tape but now that i know where its at this level is easy as th level st competition skate park  come on
these judges are way too easy to impress you dont even have to get  to win the goldth level downtown  bit more challenging but most of its easyth level downhill jam  the hardest level in the game there are several things wrong here
first skate how in the  are you supposed to get skate when the e is at an almost impossible position
ive seen it done but its hard as  to get
second the secret tape is way to hard to get i mean come on you have to have slow mode on to get it otherwise its very very hard to reach
why didnt they put this as the last level instead of streets
its way harder than that levelth level nd competion burnside  great challenge awesome layoutth level streets  the best level for the fact that every challenge is as easy as it is hardth level rd competition roswell  very hard to impress judges but great layout
remember you have to get all gold in all three competitions to get your videohope you enjoyed my reviewnow get your  out of the house and go skatethe original tony hawk pro skater was a surprise hit for activision when it was originally released for the playstation because it was unlike any other skating game before it
other games with skateboarding like sonys xtreme series xtreme xtreme etc incorporated skateboarding but the results were lackluster at best
what made tony hawk go above and beyond your average extreme sports games was that there was an added realism incorporated with easy to pull moves and tricks that rounded out a real fun package
this game was revolutionary at its time and it spawned two sequels that topped the original and a host of imitators that still cant match the original tony hawk
the soundtrack is worth noting as well primus dead kennedys suicidal tendencies and the suicide machines lend some tracks making the game even more enjoyable
if you have never played the original tony hawk but have played the sequels chances are you wont like this but no matter how you look at it the original tony hawk pro skater is a piece of modern video game historythps is one of those games that you cant stop playing for weeks
i remember the first day that i bought it i played until midnight and then remembered i had to go to school the next day and stopped
that day i couldnt learn i just was thinking about playing the game
finally  hours later the bell rang and i ran home
i didnt do my homework told my mom that i didnt have any got some popcorn soda and chips and went to my room and played the game until midnight again the same thing happened all week
the reason for this happens is simple the game is near perfect no wait ill refrase it is perfect
the graphics are good tricks are very welldone levels are all fun the pros you can be are good choices and the soundtrack is so wicked awesome
i also think that the plot was good and how many sports games have plots
yeah like none
and when you beat the game instead of saying quotokay what do i do knowquot you say something like quotwhew
that was sick
i want to go and check out that huge gap in the downhill jam levelquotso if you like tony hawk get this game
if you like skateboarding get this game
if you like skateboarding video games get this game
if you like sports games get this game
if you dont like skateboarding get this game
if you dont like sports games get this game
if you like or dont like anything i just mentioned get this game
that means anybody everbody
if you can hear me go get tony hawks pro skaterskateboarding is not a crime  but trying to top tony hawks pro skater in the fun factor rating will be
this fast paced thrillaminute skateboarding game will be the standard on the playstation for a while
its one of the best games this year and its full slate of tricks bails and twists that will keep you satisfied for a while
dont think that just because its a skater game that you have to be a skater to play it
tony hawk lets the novice and the skate junkie alike enjoy the action
theres no complicated story line or rendered cut scenes inbetween skating  you simply grind gleam and glide through ten different skate areas including classics like burnside in portland or the streets of san francisco
youll tear it up in abandoned warehouses schools and even in a river gorge in phoenix
pick from one of ten skaters all with different moves and special tricks as you try to grab high scores find hidden video tapes and collect other items to help you reach your objectives
the game is a slick piece of work for the playstation
although you will find the occasional seam split or blank polygonal deadend youll be amazed by the detail in the game including the fullon face bashing and asphalt bloodletting that hardcore skaters are used to
but what really seals this skates fate is the games incredible speed which blazes past games like trickstyle for the dreamcast
the compliment of special moves is also spectacular with a level of variation that makes almost any gravitydefying trick possible
a good skater would readily admit that the music attached to skate culture is a big part of the experience
activision never slouched by giving lame generic studio music to tony hawk fans  expect the thrash stylings of the dead kennedys primus goldfinger and suicidal tendencies to round the soundtrack out
dont like skate music
turn it off and skate to frank sinatra to see what a difference a song makes
although the game is styled so novices can easily figure out the controls finger pimps will rule the roost in tony hawk
some of the better combinations and the higher scores are achieved by the most intense finger aerobics since track and field
mashing wont help either  you have to know the combos to score
all in all tony hawk is an impressive tourdeforce in the skating arena
competition like mtv sports snowboarding trickstyle and thrasher skate and destroy already have the bar set pretty high with this game
who will bring the hawk down
its going to take a fairly highflying predator to do the jobpunk skatin in your living room
tons of great trick including the 
unexplaynably great worlds
hell i give it a gabagilion starzthis is a review for the playstation version of quake iiquake was a very popular and influential firstperson shooter series on the pc and im happy to report that everything you love about the series there has remained almost exactly the same on the playstation consolei cant help but compare quake ii to medal of honor because moh was the very first firstperson shooter i ever owned
the controls in quake ii are almost exactly the same except in quake ii the l and r buttons on the playstation controller are used to move your target up and down
the target is the little white thing that permanently stays in the middle of the screen
its used to line up the perfect kill shot
learning to use this target properly will probably take about a half hour because to be totally honest with you its not exactly the easiest way to find and eliminate enemies
if you think this control system is a bit strange i wont disagree
youll learn to adjust to it though
give the game time to sink infirst let me mention that despite what people might say you can in fact use a regular old playstation controller for this game
thats what im using right now in fact
i dont care about all these dual shock and analog controllers that are supposed to make the gaming experience superior because the reality is that a regular controller works just fine
sorry but using a directional pad to play firstperson shooters is much easier for me
i need to hit the up button to walk and the x button to shoot
thats exactly what quake ii allows me to doafter a good  minutes with the game i think the controls are almost perfect
i have no problem at all controlling the game
furthermore the framerate is lightning fast and incredibly smooth
how many games with a smooth and nearperfect framerate can you find on your playstation
okay theres medal of honor and tons of thirdperson shooters like the resident evil series in addition to lots of d adventure games such as mega man x and castlevania symphony of the nightthe honest truth is that many games have choppy framerate issues that make it extremely tough to enjoy a game
many games are designed where you can actually get stuck to the side of a wall when going around a corner duke nukem anyone
not to mention many games have an unresponsive button system you press a button and nothing happens or your command is delayed a couple seconds annoying
quake ii does not have any of these problems
it somehow manages to avoid all the problems that many games have a nasty habit of having and instead gives us a sweetlooking and easily playable gamethe enemies you encounter in quake ii are pretty smart
if they see you they will keep shooting until you die
however i found a trick you can do to fool the enemies
walk up next to one allow them time to see you then quickly hide behind a crate or go back out into the previous room or run into another room turn around and wait for them to run to you
they will most likely come to you and this is the very best time to take them out
this is a trick i learned in medal of honor and im happy to find it also works in many situations here in quake iiso lets see
the framerate is identical to medal of honor in addition to the controls
how about the graphics
quake ii has pretty good colorful graphics which is surprising because most playstation games are dark not to mention the pc version mostly features dark and ugly hallways and rooms
the animations from enemies dying isnt exactly the best youve ever seen but please keep in mind that quake ii is supposed to be a nonstop shooting bloodbath of a game and of course compared to the pc version of the same game of course everything on the pc version will look and play a little better
youre supposed to be amazed that the playstation can even handle such an excellent game so well with only minor problems
extremely minor problems at thatthe thing that really amazes me about the playstation version of quake ii is that when you go around corners or run down a hallway the graphics on the ceiling floor or side of a wall never turn choppy or glitchy
never
im serious
were talking about an old playstation game here where the framerate and graphics consistently hold up and remain silky smooth like homemade caramel
everything remains firmly intact
this is truly amazing
excellent job and a huge thank you to all the people who created this game
they understood that controlling a game and not having the graphics fall apart while running around shooting is the most important aspect of a game
not just firstperson shooters either any kind of gameokay sometimes the game might slow down when too many enemies are on the screen at once
big deal
slow down has always been an overrated problem among most people who complain about it in my opinion
just because a game occasionally slows down a little bit shouldnt be a reason to put a game down everanother thing people criticize about games loading times
the loading times in quake ii are extremely short
well not always
let me explain
you have to go through a bunch of mini levels in order to complete a mission entirely
sometimes while walking from door to door inside one of the mini levels the game will take and i promise im not exaggerating two seconds to load the next room
yes thats right
two whole seconds
its not a big deal at allhowever when each of the mini levels are complete a save option will appear on screen
the loading time here will jump up to about  seconds total
again not a big deal
not a long wait at all
i cant believe i have to mention these extremely short loading times but people seem obsessed over making a big deal over them and the truth about it needs to be said
these are reasonable and understandable loading times when you consider just how good everything about the playstation version of quake ii isthe music in the game is a bunch of van halenlike heavy metal songs with maybe a touch of crunchy megadeth riffs thrown in for good measure
if this kind of music bothers you prepare yourself because the entire game is dominated with this kind of music
its a little heavier than you might think
get ready
however some of the music is starting to grow on meas far as difficulty goes its pretty hard
mission one is easy enough with health packs sitting everywhere but as soon as mission two begins the difficulty really jumps up
even on easy mode
of course the higher difficulty options will greatly increase the challenge but i think im nice and comfortable sticking around on the easiest setting the game has available
a trick to making the game easier is to frequently aim for the heads of enemies
not their feet or stomach their headsin conclusion if you own a playstation one console and want a good firstperson shooter you cant go wrong with this fantastic version
in some areas such as graphical colors and the appropriate buttons used on the playstation controller it might even put the pc version to shameive been playing id games since the original wolfenstein
i cant begin to total the hours spent playing doomdoomfinal doom and all the wads people made at home that got swapped around on message boards and the old aol hexenehhh not so much it was fun but then came quake and holy crap was quake good
quake was to doom what doom was to wolfenstein
enter quake  i had this when it first came out on the ps and i played it till my fingers bled and my eyes dried up
very doomish level design and the ever present double barrel shotgun was a must
this time there is the machine gun that was my favorite
while it might be hard to get used to the preanalog controls move with the dpad and look up and down with the shoulder buttons after playing dual stick fpss for almsot a decade it still has the flavor that makes you want to pick it back up
i am happy to have this in my collection againvigilante  is good but nd offense is all that and much more than a bag of potato chips
some of the new additions include the ability to score new chassis for your cars and wheel attachments that turn your car into a motorboat a ufo or a snowmobile
all the characters from the original are back except  although they drive different cars and in most cases have different special weapons
even y the alien makes an appearance this time disguised as a mysterious garbage man scavenging for parts to repair his damaged luxo saucer
some of the new characters include a monkey disguised as an astronaut a religious fanatic a ninja and a robotic cowboy
every level is interactive to the core and you can rocket into space cause nuclear explosions compete in downhill sports and unleash a giant radioactive ant that goes on a rampage through arizonawhat really sets the v series apart from other car combat games is the creative special weapons for each car
unlike most cc games the specials in this game are more than just different types of missiles
from sparkspewing disco balls to eagles that cause tornadoes to alien invasions the specials in this game are all entertaining and fun to use
my personal favorite is the half tracks hades gate weapon which causes your car to literally go to hell and back causing lots of damage during the return tripoverall v is a blast to play and the best in its genre
forget twisted metal black  this is the true king of car combatlove this gamelove games like itglad someone had it cause now i own itagain thank you good sirmadamvigilante  nd offense has a great quest mode that begins a few years after vigilante   two of the main quotcharactersquot from that film are involved in a freak quotaccidentquot caused by a bit of time travel
the coyotes who were wiped out at the end of vigilante  have returned to wreck havoc on the us economy
the vigilantes are resurrected and its up to them to save the daythe quest mode includes three sets of characters the vigilantes the coyotes and the drifters
in order to see all the scenes of the movie and fill in the story line you have to beat each character and complete all objectives
the objectives are more difficult than in the original vigilante  game and on the drifters levels they are plain absurd
the objective levels with the drifters are the most difficult to meet and a hint would be to get the crazy stuff out of the way before going on to the more attainable goalsanyway the graphics and controls are all improved from the original game
there are more vehicles more weapons and more options
also the soundtrack is a little more variable as well
the quest mode is the best thing about this game because you keep playing to unlock all the little movies to find out what happens
however the twoplayer modes are a lot of fun to play too
i really enjoyed playing vigilante  nd offense and found it to be even much more fun than vigilante ive rarely seen a game where opinions are so sharply divided but perhaps i can make it a bit clearer
first many of the negative comments have to do with technical problems from installation to crashes
dont let that put you off theres a patch that seems to  solve all the serious problems
i had no issues at all with the latest  versionas for the game itself all i can say is that i havent been  this engrossed in a game for years
you start off thinking its a  firstperson shooter a la half life but soon after dying a lot you  realize that youll need to try something else
thats when the clever  stealth side really emerges
its not mgslike sneaking around yawn but  hiding in broad daylight in other peopleonce you get the hang of it  its hard but fair its incredibly cool
it opens a whole new dimension  of game play and lateral thinking
it also means that you can solve problem  in any number of ways possess a cop to shoot your way out a prostitute to  charm your way out a rat to sneak your way out etc
and of course the  game looks fabulous as technically impressive as half life but with  shinys trademark lush scifi detailing think mdk and vivid hues and  transparencies
if you find firstpersonshooters a bit samey but want more  action than tomb raiderlike exploramas this is the game for you
beautiful provacative fastmoving and seductive
highly recommendedan a fairly experienced gamer i found quotmessiahquot to be a breath  of fresh air in the glut of subpar games out there deigned to take our  valuable money
by now you know the scheme and the tasks
let me just say  i found the game both rewarding and challenging and appealed to all of my  creative instincts that a game should appeal to
and yes it is  funnymy computer did struggle with the game and i did experience a  few crashes
but nowadays what doesnt crash our computer except microsoft  hearts and minesweeper
i did find the patch very helpful in these  situationsif you are a gamer i strongly recommend messiah as your  next purchase
you wont regret your choicedid you like fallout
youll like this
if you didnt you probably wont  like this one either
same basics graphics different story different  part of california
some minor changes  you can get a car to cover those  large distances the cars trunk holds lots of stuff and there are new  monsters but not enough of them
still you can get married and you can be  a fluffer in a porn studioi love fallout exspecially fallout   i bought fallout  because i play fallout and loved it
if youve played fallout before fallout  youll find that fallout  is a lot more discouraging
its a lot harder to  develop a new character
youll never reach a point where youre immortal  eg
you can kill anything with ease
but anyway fallout  is still  great
i let my friend play fallout  and he had a sleepover at my house  just so he could play fallout   everyone i know loves fallout those with loaded guns and those who dig
this game is pure freakin genious
they improved on the perfect fallout and made it into something jesus christ himself would love to ownthe story involves your character on his search for the garden of eden creation kit for arroyo your tribal villiage founded by the original vault dweller ie the character you played in fallout
he is your ancestor
along the way you get to interact with many intersting characters humans mutants ghoulsmutated scorpions weird cult people and those much hated by me deathclaws
grrr
this games is about  times longer than the unfortunalty short fallout and you get a car
this speeds up movement on the game mapone the mapthis game takes place north of the ncr area shady sands in fallout
if you yearn for a wonderful game where you can shoot humans ghouls sleep with a crim bosses daughter or just shoot up some jet with lil jesus in new reno or perhaps tour the wonderful golgotha cemetery where people are either impaled on sticks or strung out for the birds then pick up this game
although you may want to play fallout firstto get the full effect
i am awaiting fallout iiiwhat can i say that hasnt been said already
other that some minor bugs  that you can patch in a matter of minutes the game is awe inspiring
improvment upon the first game includes many more hours of gameplay plus a  way to judge just how evil if this is your perfered path your character  really is
streamlined menus for npc interaction in combat a major plus  and the addition of new perks is very niceyou want a game that has  great replay value and that youll enjoy from begining to end
this is it  the last stopyears after fallout and fallout  came into being i had replayed the first one over  times
the second several times though not so many only because it is much longer and more indepth
this series was so great because of the simple fact that it is doubtlessly the least linear game ive ever met
there were so many quests to complete and each outcome small or large created repercussions throughout the game
it was hilarious but at the same time one of the most violent things at the time though hardly even close by todays violent standards
the violence was fun interactions with various characters you meet were fun the satire of just about everything from scientology even tom cruise and nicole kidman to karate flicks to scifi greats with even nods to more recent pop culture like south park
the breadth of the game still astounds methe semisequel to this fallout tactics was very disappointing in its linearity
they need to make more games like the first two fallouts that can engage you not by shoving you around toward a set goal but simply letting you play
and doing it so well you want to come back time and time again without repeating the same story more than oncethere is nothing for me to say that already hasnt been said by the other reviewers
just know that if you like rpgs at all then youll most likely love falloutwhat makes this rpg so much better than its competition
story
a completely immersive and interesting world with a plot that drives you on
the chosen one your pc evolves more than any character of any rpg i  have ever played by the end you will look back at how your character  started and how far hes come and you will be amazed
full of little  cookies and distractions as well
you will not miss the fact that it has  no multiplayer nor will you be disappointed with its simple interface
what other game lets you become a kungfu master a mafia madeguy and a  drug addict all while toasting your enemies with your trusty flame throwerafter solving fallout shortly after reviewing it some months ago i immediately loaded fallout  and set off on the second part of the adventure
since then ive been far too busy to review anything until i  solved it last night
quotfalloutquot is just the trainer for the big  one
fallout  uses the same engine as the original and was easy to  slip into since the commands were all familiar but because the initial  release is notoriously buggy make sure you install the patch before you  start
set  years after the events in fallout your character is a  descendent of the vault dweller who with some refugees had established a  village far to the north when expelled after saving vault   over the  years village life had become increasingly tribal and memories of vault   had slipped into the murky realms of mystical memory
drought had set in  crops failed children and cattle were starving when a chance viewing of an  old holotape revealed the existence vault s garden of eden creation kit  geck
 just what was needed for a bountiful existence
after  surviving a difficult test your character the chosen one is sent off  with few skills and little equipment to locate the holy vault  and  return with the geck
of course it is not quite as easy as that as  you gradually find out the master in fallout was a pussycat compared to  your ultimate opponentsthis is definitely a game for mature people who  can laugh at themselves  sex straight and gay and drugs play a major  part in the story line
there are twists and turns that will have you  falling about laughing and some repellent attitudes that will sicken you
you have to lie cheat steal and fight your way through pretty nasty  scenes and delicately negotiate your way through others
good deeds are  rewarded if you help out frank in the den go back and visit him later  when hes made good  his generosity is a huge help and bad decisions are  paid for leave that pariah dog to his own fate
there are quite a few  chance encounters some screamingly funny especially for fans of monty  python star trek etc
and for a basically moral character some pretty  distressing where you are completely powerless
and though its pretty  gory nothings funnier than the way some of these critters fly apart after  a good critical hit
fallout  is a much larger game than the original  and to make traversing the vast distances easier after several quests you  actually get  wait for it  a car
many differently skilled npcs are  eager to join you how many you can have in your party depends on your  charisma
where you had little control over npcs in your party in  fallout in fallout  you can get them to wear improved armour select  better weapons and they sometimes actually increase their skills when your  character levels
i developed a tight little bunch consisting of the  loyal sulik give him a supersledge and watch him go
and vic whose  repair skill is essential until yours is developed if you can tolerate his  sucking up and constant whining about sulik cassidy much better with  weapons than your character when you find him and after i solved all his  towns problems marcus the mutant entertainingly voiced by michael dorn  worf from star trek
hint if you do have marcus join take his minigun  away before he shreds your entire party and give him a more focussed  weapon but he is very pickythe great thing about this game is that it  is nonlinear and you can switch between good or evil as the whim takes  you
however it became evident after quite some playing time that i had  not developed my initial characters attributes or skills in the direction  i wanted to take so with the knowledge gained i started again with a  character who relied less on strength and endurance but was more  intelligent and perceptive but not too weak as some of the best perks  have minimum requirements
this tradeoff made the initial stages very  difficult but really paid off later
choosing three tag skills was hard   scientific skills both medical and technological were more important than  some combat skills and quickly developed thievery skills were essential  as everything was so expensive but these were useless without good  weapons negotiation and survival skills
a thorough reading of the  excellent spiralbound yippee
manual before developing your character  really saves a lot of time
and watch the wonderful introductory scenes  for a lot of cluesmy advice to adults who love rpgs is to forget the  quasimedieval sword and sorcery worlds and get into the postapocalyptic  life of sex drugs and great big guns as soon as you canfirst off some background
i am not a nice guy
i do not say nice things about games just to avoid hurting peoples feelings
if you dont believe me check out reviews of some of the games ive trashed like might  and magic   so when i tell you that this game is by far the best rpg ive  ever seen believe me
some of the things i liked about ita genuinely  nonlinear story line  starting with character developement you can take  radically different paths through the game
most of the situations in the  game can be resolves in several different ways all of which lead to  different outcomes with different effects on the world and the npcs
you  can also choose which side to support in several different political  fightsthe best npc system ever  the npcs in the game are extremely  well written and seem to have lives and goals of their own
their  dialogue is well written and gives each one a unique voice
and some of  the political maneuvering that they are involved in is really quite  complicated
they seemed more like the characters in a novel than the  cardboard cut outs i usually see in rpgs
the games conversation system  is one of the nicest features
basically your characters intelligence  determines how many things he can think of to say in any given situation
this means that a smooth talking smart character will have a different set  of options than a dim witted combat machine
its a nice system that works  very wellthe game world is totally awesome
its gloomy  postapocolyptic but totally cool
the game designers really put some  time in on coming up with interesting settings
i rarely use the phrase  quotsense of wonderquot in conjunction with a computer game but time  and again i came across situations and settings that really blew me away
also the game world reflects a more adult understanding of human nature  than any other game out there
the amount of thought they put into the  political situations social structures and personal rivalries is really  quite impressiveinteresting fights unlike most rpgs which have  thousands of fights against a huge number of unintelligent opponents  fallout  tends to have fewer more interesting fights
or at least it  can
a real blood and guts player who charges into every situation with  guns blazing could still generate a lot of carnage
a particularly nice  feature is the quotoutdoorsmanquot skill which lets you spot random  encounters in the badlands and avoid them if you want
this means that  players who want to get in a rumble can do so while those who just want to  get on with the story can save the timereal choice in character  generation  simply put you cant have a character that can do it all  even with huge amounts of experience
hence youve gotta make some hard  choices and play those out
the game is very different depending on  whether you choose to play a smooth talker a stealthy type or a combat  machinea clean quick combat engine  the combat system is flexible  enough to generate some very interesting tactical situations but clean  enough to run pretty quickly
given the lethality of the weapons involved  most fights end in less than five rounds so every move is critical
its a  nice break from some of the thirty round slug fests that go on in games  like might and magic a vast improvement over the original which was also fun but not like this
here there is more of everything we like a bigger map more cities more enemies and more violent violence
lengthier quests and more npcs that can join the fight
an even funnier storyline with more dirty devious morally bankrupt adversaries to overcome
its really fun to pretend to be a slavedriver and then murder all your coworkers with a submachine gun
it really is
and then watch all the poor slaves run away turn by turnand we can gamble and drink and ignore the beggar and still embark on the heros quest
wonderful
there is too much technology in this one for it to capture the feel of the original but still its great funno time limit so we can take our time enjoying the landscape and outbrutalizing our brutal adversariesnew weapons better weapons with improved fatality scenesmore choices to make
hero or villain
you cant finish the game as a villain but you can still have plenty of funstill a few drawbacks however  the travel system hasnt been fixed
you still have to wander around in the desert hoping to be attacked by something stronger than mole rats yet weaker than aliens
 limited party size
it gets tiring always being outnumbered especially when youve got so many socalled friends out there
 the world is large but the character you play is tiny on the screen  whats going on here
 the last missions are too hard with too little reward at the end of themi remember the first fallout game sat on my shelf for a long time bc a friend who had lent it to me told me it was a post nuclear holocast world
personally it sounded too grim so i didnt check it out for monthswell when i finally loaded it in i was in for a big surprise
shortly thereafter i rushed out to get falloutthe good parts about this game unlike most rpgs you get to roleplay with a variety of educated replies
if you pick the right ones you get more information
and if you screw up too bad
you dont get to ask the other questions for the most part
i always hate in the rpgs where you tick off a person and then ask them another question and they act like youre their friendeven better if you have a high intelligence or good speech skills youre rewarded with more dialogue options
 great graphics great noises all the weapons and noises of dying people if thats your thing are fairly believable
you can even click bloody mess as a perk to see some really gruesome visuals
 you can have more allies you can outfit them with better armor and weapons all have different personalities which means they may or may not be good in combat may leave you if you tick them off opponents are tougher you get away with less mistakes positioning is much more important the storyline is multilayered the game lasts about three times as long as the original fallout much more to do as it is longer you effect more of the world at the end of the story new and better weapons to penetrate power armor a problem in the first fallout less linear there is a time limit of sorts but only for about  of the game thereafter you can meander all you like wo running out of time more perks and such to make yourself toughter look for the slayer
 less bugs be sure to go their website and get the patch update if not included get to use a car in this game to drive around and  move quickly usual opponents from fallout are turned on their head the enemy isnt always the enemy chance to meet more women in the game if thats your thing much tougher wandering encounters happens more often too bandits are much tougher watch it
 the game rewards you if you choose to go down the dark path or the path of lightthings not so good you need a lot of time to play this game like  hrs i would say or more if youre big on logic or environmental issues there are too many monsters and no creatures to prey on except a small number of humans
i walk around fighting things left and right and then find some safe peddler out in the middle of nowhere
geeshif you can overlook that though not a big dealoverall a great game with lots of rpging
five stars and more
you will lovei think its been  years since this game was released so i thought i should write a review since none of the front page reviews do it justiceto argue which of the fallout series was best is irrelevant
its been  years now and both are one and the same concept
play both enjoy both and marvel in a world that is astonishingly engrossing
a postnuclear environment dark violent and obscene
it oozes atmosphere
the desolate landscapes paranoid androids and the filth and scum in between
there is remarkable insight into the societies at large
communities that build walls to protect visa approved citizens ravaged towns filled with junkies bums thugs whores and gangsters secret brotherhoods and tribal villages a decaying military faction slaves mercenaries the list goes on
riddled within the world are traces of old and new technology
the mad max influences are all there
salvaged ammunition restored handguns modified  equipment armor explosives foods drugs alcohol whatever you can find steal trade buy or kill to surviveand that is just what lays before you as a distraction
you can just about do anything
the main objective is a deep and character driven story which requires a plethora of other sidequests
so you can quickly see how interactive and time consuming this game will becomethe character himself is riddled with quirks skills gifts and character points
its a subdivision of the game itself to deliver and develop a character of  sufficient capabilites that best suit your gameplay
a master thief quick shooter charismatic merchant an incredible hulk kung fu fighter  intelligent geek a porn star believe it a tactical sniper a outdoor scout a cocaine addicted tony montana again the list goes on
how you play the game shapes who you are and the quirks that are made available to you
you even have a reputation to keep whether it is legendary feared or downright wantedthe gameplay is unique to this series
it is vaguely similar to the final fantasy series freestyle when you are walking around but during fights it changes to a turn based setup
all of a sudden an interface pops up and your characters traits and skills  give rise to a subdivision of options
there are many things to consider like action points luck trademark blows health and zoning in bodyheadlimb shots the list goes on and on
within this there are quirks that can help even more eg
there is a quick draw quirk you may obtain that can allow you to draw first blood in most fights you can even close shop and try to run
also take into account the many many many different weapons available to you from knives guns explosives
boost your stats with some drugs but risk getting addicted you will have to continue to find and use
there is so much here and the interface makes it so easy to access and utilise all of itthe graphics are obviously outdated but suprisingly i prefer it to the d rendering of todays rpgs
it is based on photorealism d art think mortal kombat  that used to be utilised back in the mid s
there is an advantage to this it feels so much more realistic
just take a look at some of the death animations gruesomeeven with all the shortcomings of this obsolete d technology i think it brings more life to this post apocalyptic worldin the thick of it all is the opportunity to meet an array of characters
some you may allow to join you
again you will need to manage and provide for these characters
each with their own personality which brings me to my final point about this game
something some of the rpg games even today  dont have like grand theft auto
personality
playing this game is like reading a book
you become heavily invested in the characters
there is so much tongue and cheek humour so much history by the time you play fallout 
im not talking about storyline but the characters themselves
current generation games seem not to go past stereotypical meet and greet characters who are more interested to give you your next objective checkpoint
its uncanny how right they got this game
its unjust how wrong they were to abandon fallout  interplay went bankrupt and i believe the licence has been given to another software agency to pursue  fallout  i have been waiting for the third one for  years now every once in a while checking the computer games catelogues ive given up hope of a great sequel specially in the hands of a totally different production teamenjoy this if you havent alreadythis was one of the best games that i have played in a while
it has an engaging story line with more than one ending
it has challenging yet not difficult game play the ability to be more than one character and great  graphics
its world is infinitely engaging
while this game as i said does  have more than one ending it does not have an infinite amount of endings  and that is its only downsidethe original fallout was the best rpg of  almost by default
fallout  is basically more of the same which is good
however it also revived a slew of minor upgrades from enhanced npc control to extra animationsthe  most notable and important change in fallout  is better npc ai and  controls
in the original fallout npcs were almost useless except  dogmeat
you control options from chemical usage to weapon selection
in  the end the truth is that fallout  is another outstanding rpg and expands  on its predecessor impressively with more places graphics sounds and  gameplay
if you like rpgs at all pick up fallout  you wont regret itthis games great
some people are complaining that its just about the same as the original but how do you improve something thats perfect
plus its not just the same as fallout  mainly because of its many many  subplots that you can be involved in
i think the subplots are even more  fun than the actual story
youll find yourself saying quotto heck with  the stinking starving villagers
ive got to become a made man for the  wright familyquot or whatever your current situation is
regardless  of whether you played the last fallout or not its a great game worth  buyingproduct is in excellent condition and i never played fallout until fallout  came out so i bought fallout tactics fallout  and this game and they all rockmore baldurs gate
this expansion adds a higher xp cap more areas more weapons and more baddies
if you were a fan of the original then you will definitely find more gaming goodness here
this adds around  hours of gameplay as well as making the original game more of a challenge which is always a plus
if you liked the original get this nowi love baldurs gate episodes
sometimes it runs a little slow but ive gotten used to it
recommend to allin one word  wow
this game is simply one of the best adventures ive across
ive just finished playing the first two introductory chapters of baldurs gate which is all that is available in my city
im in love with this game
this game provides the kind of classic adventuring experience ive always longed for in as many adventure games ive played so far
the wait ended with baldurs gate
very many thanks to its developersfor how much ever ive played of it the game is simply superb
it reminded me a lot of previously played games like diablo and one of my very first short time adventure game dink smallwood by rt softwhat i find most interesting about this game are the variety of character classes allowed from which to select your character type and adding and removing team members
sometimes deciding over this itself will take a lot of your time
the plot of the game looks great and its many twists n turns are quite shocking
besides the main plot you also have many side quests
the graphics are very pretty and one look at the homes and inns cannot help but remind me of dollhousesim sure this game is a hot favorite with all adventure fans
 starsthe first time i played this i tried to get to the end too soon and wasnt able to win the final battle
then i went through each area and combed it carefully
there are many artifacts and items which you need to win the final battle
rings tomes etc
not to mention you better get youself maxed in levels before you even think about ittrue to form rpg you start low have a mysterious occurance and you are on your way
fun
my favorite characters are boo and minsk
theres even guest appearances by favorites from a couple fantasy series as wellok i admit it
i didnt purchase this when it first came out
i looked at the screenshots i read the reviews but i didnt think the game was for me
i was into shootersi coulnt be bothered with these so called rpgs
then the price dropped below and my computer gaming was never the same
this is by far one of the best computer rpgs that i ever played
the character options were so vastthe companions were plentiful and the weapons were totally awesome
i spent a good  hours with this game and even then once i was finishedi started another character and played it again
no other game had that kind of power over me
if you still havent played this gameget it now
there are even usermade upgrades that improve the graphics if you have the sequel
this is one game that should be in everyones collectionbaldurs gate redefines and completes the lack of roleplaying games recently
i cant remember last time i played a good role playing game on my pc
i must say that games like zelda and other quotrole playingquot games are quite good
but for the hardcore experience of role playing as true to real role playing as possible you have to have a pc to make it workfinally the pc gets a game that is hardcore role playing
baldurs gate is everything i want in a game within this genre plus much more
i only wish that there were more games like this
for any role playing fan i urge you to try this one out
it has lots of characters to get into depths with many paths to take although there is of course just one plot in the game
the music is breathtaking as well which i think is very important to captivate the playernot since daggerfall has there been a game that captivates the player into its world as much as baldurs gate and still baldurs gate does know its limitations unlike for instance daggerfallbaldurs gate  is ok but i recommend the first game most hearty
because of its incredible music wonderful story compelling adampd style and with the quality which no game that i can remember hasthis game demonstrates what happens when a design team are not jaded from experience but full of passion and determinationthe makers of baldurs gate got one under the radar by following their intuition and making a near perfect game of its time
and yep they changed the whole industry while they were at itthe game play is astonishingly compelling especially after the first  hours of play while you are orienting yourself with the many possibilities of the interfacethe thing about bg is that you can play it within an hour to a satisfactory level
but as you progress you begin to realise that there is literally no end to the level of complexity with which you may approach the game
on top of all that the interface of bg somehow manages to be much more simple than others and is a pleasure to interact withoddly many reviews rave about this and the sequels amazing story but i beg to differ
theres nothing wrong with the story its very tastefully and cleverly done but its only just barely novelworthy
the characters are terrific and there is a wonderful eccentricity about the whole adventurethe really astonishing thing about this game is the gameplay design level design and balancing and yes to a large extent this is because of the add system that powers the games conceptsalmost every battle requires thought  not that you are always in real danger but if you dont stick to your strategies and you will develop many you will be in serious trouble
the balancing is extraordinary
you can actually sense that every battle even the toughest is winnable but that you need to position players a certain way or equip them a certain way or use the right spell  and youll get there  its all completely logical and flawless
whats more you are confident that there are many different ways to get through each battle each entertaining in its own right
in bg the game lets you play  the system is unerringly consistent and the keys to winning the big battles all make sense when they click in your mind
the interface and balancing never let you downthe infinity engine now has been around for ever since  but damned if it isnt the most satisfying crpg interface still in existence
quick access to everything for  characters at a time  its really somethingthe graphics are also ancient but they are just so charming  beautifully hand painted backgrounds and moody lighting on the interiors with bucket loads of atmosphere
it never gets old
sometimes its hard to put your finger on why the art direction of one product is superior to another but baldurs gate was done with such artistry and class it still shames a lot of modern competitiongraphics have improved and will continue to as will path finding cpu grunt and everything else that should make games better
but baldurs gate is still the most authentic and playable rpg experience
it doesnt hold your hand it doesnt force you down a path  it just lets you genuinely role play at whatever level of complexity you like  and whichever level you choose it rewards youbaldurs gate is genuinely deserving of its classic status and if the crpg market rewards us with another game this immaculately entertaining it will be a day for celebrationi baught this game for the second time and i was hooked
i would play this game for at least  hours a day completely neglecting everything not involved with the game im not kidding
and now the pros
excellent storyline pulls you in puts you in a head lock and refuses to let you goexcellent interface easy to learn unless you play diablothe spell system for this game is awesometons of spells a bunch of schools of magicvast game
if you do everything it totals around  hourseach character has hisher own personality and reacts to situations differentlysuch as when khalid panics and runs away like a little girl
and even though it sounds like its bad these arent horrendous the consthe graphics leave a little to be desired but if you dont have good gameplay and story then what good are all the flashy graphics in the world gonna do you
the character movements are a bit jerky liker theyre all descendants of the tinmanif you misdistribute the thief skills you can count on missing a lot of goodies that are in locked cratesbasically if you want one of the best rpgs ever based on second edition dandd rules buy this game
its a bajillion times better than diablo and its equally stupid sequal combined
those games have almost no plot they are a disappointment to all games and should be destroyed for even calling themselves rpgsthe plot is awesome to baldurs gate you can do whatever you want complet a quest dont complete one it doesnt matter but you pay the price
and hey in what other game can you kill anyone you want including hookers
and in what other game can you give dead cats to little girls
huh
if you havent played it buy it for the whole  dollars they sell it for and youll see what i mean
when you beat it their an expansion a sequel an expansion for the sequel icewind dale an expansion for that and the soon to be released icewind dale  all of these games you can import the same guy into
buy ityou know i blame everything on ray muzyka and greg zeschuk
had they remained on track as physicians seeing sick patients all week and spending their evenings working late and catching up on paperwork instead of abandoning their glamorous clinical life to found bioware then they would have never developed baldurs gate
and then i would have been blissfully happy because not only wasbaldurs gatethe first rpg i played in its entirety from beginning to end it was also my gateway drug into the genreonce they had me hooked into the concept of mindless repetitive character rolling to find the one with the perfect strength characteristics i was looking for i was much more picky when i was younger than i am now it was the beginning of the end at least for me
soon i progressed to more puissant and addictive games such asbaldurs gate expansion tales of the sword coastbaldurs gate ii shadows of amnbaldurs gate  expansion throne of bhaal and thenicewind daleas i lay listlessly recovering from a protracted relationship withicewind dale  i truly believed that my social life was at its nadir
little did i know then that they had only just begun to exercise their awesome power over me
soon i was completely enslaved and spiraling out of control withneverwinter nightsoh the hours i wasted looking for those wretched waterdhavian creatures  the cockatrice the dryad the yuanti and lets not forget the intellect devourer and by the time i realized that the real intellect devourer was the game itself it was too late andstar wars knights of old republicandmass effectandmass effect and amazon limits me to  links per review else i could have gone on indefinitely kotor  and jade empire and dragon age i and iiand look at me now gentle reader and weep
i am but a mere pale shadow of my former self a swtor habitueacute who alas still plays the same character that i did in baldurs gate ie
the lawful good paladin for i have in essence rolled the same attributes for every bioware game since my very first rpg character set foot in candlekeep all those years ago
my only regret is that i have never been chaotic evil
ever
which is why i know in my heart that i will never be emperor of the galactic empire
i believe that baldurs gate messed with my head in some subliminal way and as a consequence i am doomed to be the once and future lawful good pallysoon now i must buy mass effect  i have no choice for greg and ray like scylla and charybdis are calling my namesummary imo ray and greg are probably the primary reason why there is a great disturbance in the forcethis game is great because of many reasons the main one being that you totally get pulled into the game and the characters on your team or quotpartyquot feel like real because all of them have a unique character agenda and background
furthermore almost everyone you meet has something original to say to you
of course after a while they will repeat
the game has a wide choice of install size too from a huge  and alitllebit gigabytes which will lower the loading times o a relatively small  mb which will make the games load times long
the game is extremely long and can take from  to  and more daysdepends on your skills how often you save and whether you only do the main quest or if you do some or all of the subquests the game is difficult on any difficulty level unless you follow the exact reccomended routes and not wander off to you know adventure
but if you save often get the best armor and weapons for our characters keep a lot fo potions with you and pause to think out your tactical moves you should find the game extremely addictive and very fun
if you like adampd or if you really like rpgs you will love this game
if you are new to the genre this will get you in the game and keep you in
if you arent a fan of rpgs this is a good game to start with
if you want to try computer games this might be a wee bit hard unless you have playd adampdohmygawd
this game is sooooo addicting and fun
i feel like a pimply faced teenager again rolling dice in a freinds home long into the summer nights playing dd
the rpg concept has been captured so very well in this game
if you are a dd freak you will love this game
black isle rulesive been playing rpgs for quite a few years and have played quite a few of the old adampd titles but hadnt seen anything that really interested me since ultima vii viii was a bit of a dog  i never finished
by the  time i got bored about halfway through eye of the beholder iii i thought  id had it with adampd  but then i saw so much written about bg and  from the reviews etc
i knew i would love it so i rushed out and bought a  new pc and bg bundled with tsc was the first thing i loadedlet me  tell you this is a serious game
six cds of it
you have to do some  serious character generation and a lot of  preparation before you get  going
as stated by other reviewers your characters die at the drop of a  hat in the early parts  no wonder people resort to cheating when your  characters start off so weak and so poor
i ended up doing a few early  quests and importing my character which imports with gained experience  intact
 loaded up with as many arrows as i could carry and started again  at level   that meant imoen was level  when we met and we could start  kicking some butti still havent finished have finished chapter  and  off to durlags tower next but im still challenged
and for all those  lamenting about the loss of turnbased combat  did they never find the  pause key spacebar which allows you to simulate it
the ai only really  works with very weak opponents or to alert you to enemies while trekking  through the beautifully rendered scenery
luckily i have a big enough  hard disk to load the entire game because the cd shuffle got really  annoying very quicklylooking at the many bg sites it seems this game  has obsessed people to the point where they have played it over and over  with characters of different races classes alignments etc
i will be  glad when i get to the end and even though i love it i cant imagine why  id want to play it again  after all when you know how it ends why  bother
and there are so many other games to play
already cant wait for  bgthe graphics of baldurs gate are tight
the game world is huge spanning  full cds
you can explore everywhere battle monsters and complete quests and other missions
the character creation is highly detailed allowing you to choose from a variety of attributes for each race
if you like rpgs get this game
you can play online too but i havent tried that yetits been about  years since this monster roleplaying game came out and its still in most peoples top tenthis game totally redined the rpg once again like only the people at interplay can do
extremely detailed in every way possible
graphics sound atmosphere wilderness monstersthere isnt a bad thing to say about this
best of all it has an engrossing story line that makes you want to keep playing without sleep for hours to get to the next chaptera wonderful achievementafter having first played through knights of the old republic and jade empire i thought to check out some of biowares older releases and the baldurs gate series seemed to be the most widely regarded
my love for rpgs usually extended toward jrpgs final fantasy xenogears etc as i criticized many western efforts with good reason mind you with bland  characters and uninteresting plots
however upon downloading a playable demo of baldurs gate ii my opinion was quickly shattered
impressed with the great voice acting wonderfully addictive combat combat is usually my least favorite part of rpgs welldeveloped atmosphere and the promise of over a hundred hours of game play i immediately ordered the beastand boy what a beast of an rpg hundreds of quests characters and an incredibly epic scope i went on to discover the other infinity engine games like planescape torment and icewind daleplaying the original baldurs gate game after having played through bg shadows of amn and its expansion my experience with this title was somewhat jarring
the characters arent quite as welldeveloped as the sequel and the overall package is not as well polishedhowever surprisingly this did not detract too much from my enjoyment with baldurs gate i havnt yet finished the game however
its basically the same game with minor differences in game play with only one that affected my enjoyment going into your inventory during combat does not pause the game so your characters can be killed while equipping items and such a small but notable annoyance
also sometimes npcs will recommend i destroy the evil one in suchandsuchtown when in fact ive already done so
a minor issue with the over all polish but none of these issues should really keep people from playing this wonderful game and series
if you are new to baldurs gate and are trying to get into the series i recommend you start out with this title that way when you go through baldurs gate ii and its expansion you are pleasantly surprised with those games superior amount of polish not to mention certain characters and events will be more meaningful to youthe bad game will not pause during combat if you go into your inventory some may be turned off by the graphics but imo i enjoy these d games visuals more than bland poorly done d engines like neverwinter nights
besides the amount of detail is impressiveespecially in the sequelsthe good fun and addicting gameplay deep combat and many dungeons to plunder great charactercreation and many colorful companions to aid you on your quest hours upon hours of play add up to a really epic experience wonderful score even better than bgiis in some spots excellent usage of the dd license which portrays the forgotten realms setting very convincinglyi played this game when it came out and it astounded me
the flowers the butterflies the music the story the gameplay were all astonishing
baldurs gate is still one of the greatest games of all time
it works just fine on computers that arent brand new and an internet fan base is constantly updating it
i wouldnt recommend this game for anyone under  or so theres some real darkness here
theres also humor and of course magic
like many rpgs and unlike say doom or grand theft auto it will appeal to women and girls
save the world make friends find yourself collect neat stuff and kick some tail whats not to lovethis game is very good for rpgers and dampd players
the character classes are from dampd as well
this is basically adampd made into a computer game that you can play on your computer no duh
the combat is simple enough for anyone and looks cool as well
the meat of the game is adventuring and completing quests
all during this time your being submersed in a complex and interesting story line that evolves every new area you walk into or with every person you talk to
the fmv sequences are no where near competition to the diablo ii ones which btw are the best fmv sequences on the game market as of jan  and counting but they tell the story in vivid d
the onscreen graphics are awesome as well although in one of the towns you feel like your falling in your chair because of the way the characters are positioned on the screen relative to the surroundings
the actual roleplaying is surberb
not only are you made in deep detail you can control up to  other npcs in your party for a total of  people
with a large variety of spells weapons magic items and monsters youll be busy for well over the estimated  hours of gameplay
if your an experienced rpger this game is a musthave because of its awesome content
if your an adampd player be warned that this game is based on nd ed rules but otherwise get the game
if your new to rpgs in general get this and diablo playing diablo first so you can learn all the terms and character development
it will really teach you how to play rpgs
than move on to baldurs gate that is if you havent already gotten hooked to diablo i have to admit i have never played the pen and paper version of dampd but be that as it may i still found this game to be a very enjoyable humorous exciting and interesting rpg adventure
i have been playing rpg games for a long time now and i can say that this game hands down is in the top ten i have ever played
and if you get the expansion pack that is also available it will be even betterthis is the best game ive ever played on my computer
the only thing that i can see even comes close to eat is age of empires iithe game begins  innocently in a monastery but the plot gets so involved this game took me   hours to beat and its the rd best rpg ive ever played
i thought  xenogears and final fantasy tactics were a little better and their plots  were more thought provoking but baldurs still has a great plot
this is a  lot better than that diablo blizzard developed
the ability to go into  towns and take them over by force with drizzt is something no other game  has either
the police are a great addition too
the ability to go back  through the game as a different class gives this game almost unlimited  replayability
all in all pass up diablo and diablo ii and get this and  baldurs gate iigot this for the nostalgia value and other than playing slow its a great game still as fun as the first time i played it
shipping was fast packaging was fine  stars all around from methis game is amazing although made years ago it still plays well
i got my game with everything
case art perfect condition cd and case
nothing was worn downscratched and the game played without any skips  i even get to play it on my playstation and save without a memory cardtoy story  is one of the finest if not the finest animated movie ever to come out of hollywood
so inevidably there will be a movie tie in game
after the amazingly bad a bugs life disney interactive has spent a lot of time fine tunning this and making up for past mistakes
which is a good thing because toy story  is a fantastic game
toy story  for the playstation is a great first action adventure title for newbie commers to the playstatin world
the graphics are excellent wih lots of color and clarity they are somewhat choppy but it dosent matter
the levels are really big and interesting to go through with lots of objects fellow toys and things to interact with
the challenge level seems just right with puzzles that range from easy mixing paint wheee
to the challenging figuring out how to arrange lights so a helecopter can land
the music is also excelent with western sci fi themes and much more
the controls are fairly easy to learn and master and the two camera modes do a good job
on each level your goal is to find  pizza planet tokens
to do so you must collect  coins compleate a time race find the hidden token find  things and fight the boss
although it sounds like it can get repitetous real fast for some reason it never does
unfortunitly the game does have its share of problems
for starters the charachters in the game look incrdiably goofy
some of the evil toys you must fight can get really annoying such as the evil mexican dude in the western levels
also the overall chalange of the game isint very hard
on my first time through i died only once
that seems a bit unchallenging
the much anticipated zurg elevator battle is dissapointing with zurg being easy to defeat
my biggest gripe is that most of the areas that were seen in the movie are much different in the game
for instance the inside of the elevator shaft is only  stories tall and has  elevators and als house looks nothing like it did in the movie
overall this is a fun game that nobody should missthe good great graphics great levels music and soundsgood level of challengethe bad graphics are somewhat choppy impossible to judge jumpsand the ugly boss battles can be somewhat dissapointing levels are a lot different from the moviei remember playing this game when  it first came out and i have loved it since
i have so many fond memories of playing this game and im proud to own it again
its an excellent game for gamers of all ages and generations
a must havewhile yes this game is very dated and the graphics leave something to be desired in this day and age it has always held a special place in my heart
my brother had it when he was little and every time i got a chance i would play it
when i got older okay yes i was eighteen and had a ps in my room i knew i had to get a copy for nostalgias sakethe plot of the game is the same as the movie with some new locations added there are even clips from the movie interspersed throughout the gameplay
woody has been stolen by al the scheming toy collector and now buzz and friends have to get him back for andy
you take on the role of buzz and move around the neighborhood trying to find woody while completing tasks for different familiar characters from the filmsthe main objective in each level is to gain pizza planet tokens which allow you to advance to further levels
you do this by completing the aforementioned tasks
in every level there are five tokens to be collected total you must defeat a boss collect five of something sheep green army men etc complete a speed challenge find  coins for hamm and a mystery challenge ex in the construction yard you must mix the paint colors in the correct combinations
additionally in some levels mr potato head has lost a part of his body and if you can find it and return it to him he will let you use a special gadget such as a grappling hook and hover bootsthe levels despite the old school grahpics are still filled with all kinds of neat details and as mentioned above you get to play through some interesting areas such as als penthouse apartment and the neighborhood around andys housei will admit that some parts would be harder for younger players
now i beat it around age twelve with no problems including collecting most of the pizza planet tokens
and unless you are a very patient child i forsee a lot of kids handing the controller over to their parents during the last level where you must face off against three tough bosses at once
admittedly my brother and i were both always exceptionally good at video games for our age
but so long as youre willing to help your children through some of the tougher parts i dont see any reason why your child shouldnt play this gamekids these days in my opinion are too spoiled by hd graphics
i love them as much as the next tech nerd but if your child is going to play video games i say make em work their way up the ladderthis game is awesome
i used to have it as a kid and getting it again takes me back to the good old days
best disney game ever made alongside hercules
love this and totally recommend it to anyone
its for all agesthis game is awesome
it has a variety of tricks and secrets that you can do and find
this game may not have much levels but the levels are made really well
i havent played thps  so i think this one is the best so far
it has some cool codes you can get too
like you can go really fast all the time and you can get x the trick points
also you can get all of the tapes and that means you can get access to all of the levels
the graphics may be messed up in some parts of the game but the rest is really cool
i recommend you buy this game first before you buy any other game
thats how good it is
but it kinda gets borin after  hours or something
just take a break and play again
it gets addicting
there is many other options too
like you can play two players
that has some options too
you can play trick attack or gratifi and somethin else
they have a career mode where you can unlock all the levels and the if you go into the free skate mode you can play the levels that you unlocked
also this game has a really handy feature
you can save your game with a controller pack
there are a variety or different players you can pick
personally i use either bucky laseck or tony hawk
id say that bucky is the best
the game designers also did a good job developing the skating obsticles
my favorite level is the first level the warehouse
its small but because of that you can do many more combos
one time i got  points for doing a wicked cool triple combo with the code on
the mall is okay but it doesnt have many obsticles
the downhill jam is awesome
you have to get to that leveloverall a really good buy and worth your timethis is one of my favorite video games ever
everytime i play it i feel like im the one skating instead of tony hawkbob burnquist etc
i recommend this game to anyone who likes skateboarding or sportsthis wus the best game i had when  i had an ni got this game as a gift and i thoughtquot i wonder about this gamequot i played the demo on playstation and it was cool
i am better than my little bro
with rune glifberg andrew reynolds and chad muska
you get everything you need in one game
the only drawback is that you need a controller pak or expansion pak to save your best games
get this game with a new n or if you have a controller pak or expansion pakthis my friends is quite simply the best sports game on the market
i hate them as a whole
i find them a boorish waste of time butthis game is the bomb
i honestly dont remember a better gaming experience
also the multiplayer is greatif you have an n and love good games this is for youi just bought a gamecube and am planning on purchasing the tony hawk games for ithave funhow can you not like the original tony hawk game
besides being the hallmark of skateboarding games this game had one of the best video game soundtracks of all time and to this day it doesnt get old
fast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
aalthough in game terms this is more or less a carbon copy of the playstation version the nintendo one is less blocky and the graphics shine through
the game is set over various trcaks where you have  tapes to do
completing a task earns you a tape
tasks range from finding hidden tapes earning high scorers and finding five letters to spell out skate
the two player mode on this game is excellant the longativity is imense this is one game you wont be able to put downthis isnt the classic frogger this is the d version its the one where in the starting menu there are blocks each block is a different level and each block has  levels at least most of them each increasing in difficulty once you press on a block you have to find  frogs blue red purple orange and green with the occasional golden frog
this game is awesome and i bought it for the playstation since i used to play this when i was a kid and idk what happened to the game
i play it on my ps and i love it
this is honestly my most favorite frogger
its frustrating at times but it is too addicting to let go i just keep telling myself ill get it this time best frogger hands downto hard for me to surpass but the disc works well and the case is in good condition
maybe one day i can beat itfrogger is a great stratagy game heres why it has an classic arcade feel with a new fresh twist and new enviroments simply awesome graphics for its time great fun challenging gameplay this game is hard i mean mega hard its very challanging i mean first you have to get comfortable with the controlls then you have to get used to each and every level pass through it at least  times each to get used to obstacles  more times to make a stratagy and  more times to work your stratagy out adjust it and make sure you know whats going to happen at all moments and even then one screw up can get you squished by a car drowning in water eaten by a lizard vulture  crocodile bat ect this game never gets old plus multiplayer the game keeps you coming back for more and more and when your done youll want to repeat it over and over againheres a tip for some of you who might not know this to complete this game  you need every last colored frog which is  beating the level and unlock more areas using gold frogs their hidden in an area in one level each area one you do that you unlock more areas theres one gold from for each area so look hard their in one of the levels the enviroments are amazing the graphics make it look your in that specific place and you get sucked into it especially with the music that pairs with it gives it such an great feeling the characters are pretty cute especially the small frogs plus in this game you get built in abilities and external power your built in abilites super hop heat seeking tounge power croak my personal favorite it helps you find a frog if you just cant find it you have to know where the croak is coming from but its a life saver now then external power ups to gain access to these you need to use your heat seeking tounge in some levels there are light bug power up increases visability of your screen theres point flies  points equals one life also gain lives by ups these look like a rainbow frog in a bubble easy to spot normal hops are  points each super hops are  theres also auto hop which allows you to hold on to the dpad and he keeps jumping for a slightly faster rate quick hop this really makes you go fast and if you find a way to use both in conjunction then your seriously flying
and lastly theres the super tounge power up this extends your reach in catching power ups and flies and such its just like the old classic only improved  this will drag in old gamers who played in arcades their atari and newer ones when the game first came out and even people like me who played it when it came out on psone broke their copy and realized how awesome the game was and rebuy and replay it also the price is right acually too cheap for what you can get it for especially used in working condition just be sure to take care of it if you break it buy the skip doctor game repair system it will refuface your disks and them work like new again some very badly scratched disks may need more then one pass for more information read my reveiw on the ps or psone lcd screen combo i also reccoment these systems or the review ill soon write about the product if you buy it be warned there will be times you seriously want to rip your hair out from losing and constantly seeing the game over screen but once you finish youll see that all that horrible pain is worth it good luck and enjoy your experience  this was the first game i had on my playstation i loved it
so when i received this game i played all day
game was in great condition very cheap toogame is a classic
brought me back to my child years
it is just as addicting as i remember and i cant put it downhaving played the original battlezone i can understand why players of the first game are so critical
the original was the very first of its kind it successfully combined firstperson shooters with realtime strategythe first problem i encountered was a poorly written manual  only onethird  discusses how the vehicles and buildings actually work
once you can figure  out how to play the game bz is a blastwhat makes bz better than  bz you can enter buildings like the recycler and factory and alter  weapons loadouts
this is useful if you want all your tanks to have  spstabbers or your turrets to have lasers for instance its much  easier to build gun towers now
instead of being near a power station they  must be adjacent to a relay bunker
you can also use the relay bunkers  console to access a topdown view of the battlefield
this means you can  hop gradually towards an enemy base building relay bunkers and gun  towers as you go the graphics are better than the original
unfortunately they do require a very powerful computer
i have a pentium ii  mhz with mb ram a mb viper v videocard and a monster sound  mx soundcard  and i have to play the game with all the graphics options  turned offthe disadvantages pandemic has rewritten the original  story
in the first game it was the russians that created the furies not  the us extremely poor ai
its possible for your units to be  destroyed by friendly fire
perhaps pandemic shouldve cut and pasted the  ai routines from the first game
advice for new players  never put any of  your vehicles in front of a gun tower the bland music soundtrack
the  original games music was quiet and tense
it added an atmosphere of  excitement to the game
the new games music ocassionally excites but most  of the time doesntin summary i wish pandemic had spent more time  tightening the code
the ai routines are poor and i feel more effort  shouldve been put into making sure battlezone  runs on lowend computers  like mine
other than that its a very good game
but i dont believe it  exceeds or meets the standards of the original game
perhaps the third time  will be the charmits an old game from  but always fun to play because the fight is never always the same
one of those cool rainy day gamesalso you can be the bad guy or team if you feel like being the evil doer
create your own episode or join a campaign
you cancreate multiple vehicles if you want to bum rush your apponent mob deep or take them on single handed or just a few vehiclesvery space age and futuristic fun
and the vehicles which you can leave the one your in for another one that is on your teamare all fun and exciting to drive
also there is multiplayer where the game experience changes in a fun way
you and your friendscan play capture the flag or attack each other in a time setting to see who can destroy each other as many times as possible
inmultiplayer you can also select to battle on different planets such as pluto mars and even saturn to name a few
also the weaponschange to your choice of chemical warfare to rockets cannons and a vast array of others
theres also cheat codes
if youpress control alt and the button on the left of the number one and under the escape button in that order youll get a dropdown screen
typegamecheat
bzradar and then press enter
do the same for the following
tnt
body
view
free  notice the space after you type gamecheat and the dot
if you dont do this it wont except itto get out of the drop screen press control alt and the button next to the one and below your escape key
i highly recommend the codesto really enjoy the game experience and to stay alive until you get to know the game and what you are doing
otherwise it can be frustratingin the newsgroups and on some game magazine i read reviews that criticize the game
the bottom line of these people is that the game compared to the predecessor battlezone is cheesy
well i dont know about battlezone i  becuase i never played it
this game though is still very good
its  based on a very cool idea you are a soldier and you can drive anything  from powerful war machines to buidlings turrets and factories and such
you dont actually drive a factory you just get in and configure it the  way you want
you also can get in a turret and its damn fun to blow a bug  up with one of those big plasma turrets
if you built it and you have  to you can get into the relay station which is a building that uplinks  to a satellite and gives you a satellite view of the action and lets you  play the game in a traditional almost rts fashion
the game is scifi  and definetly arcadeish
do not expect a sim or the ultimate rts game from  it
its still a very cool idea to allow you to switch from an rts view to  a first person view you send your troops to fight and then you get in your  tank and go with them to fight and suffer the consequences of your  strategical mistakes or enjoy blow enemies up in person
i reccomend it  to any action or rts player its a game to try outhave played this game for years and still have fun with it
it even works on windows   bit
cheap clean and loads of funthis game is the first rts game that i have played along with starcraft and lords of the realm  but lords of the realm  starcraft is a whole diffrent stoty didnt have what warcraft had
the easy to get used to gameplay with great graphics in terms of running smooth the very low system requirement and the satisfaction of the battlenet
i have not played this game since  because my dad broke my cd
read my starcraft battle chest review
so i dont know if anyone plays online now but all i know is that i had the most fun playing this game back in  i remember the satisfaction that i had with my friends after beating the opponent with my ogres and the dragons
this game ran fine when i used to have intel celeron mhz mb ram and k modem
so if you get this game right now you shouldnt have any technical problems
also this game is very easy to get used to with easy gameplay and great graphics for an outdated game
this game is definitly a must have if you are a rts fan
you should know that warcraft started it all
it started the great rts gaming genrethis game was my favorite in  today it is a classic that i still go back and play from time to time
the campaign was endless fun also very difficult
the multiplayer was awesome for the time although there is no one online anymore
if youre looking to enjoy a major gem of the mids then this game is it
also if you played world of warcraft you will notice many characters referenced in that game were main characters in this game
for instance alleria is a statue in stormwind in wow but in this game she is a main ranger for the humans
so you not only get the awesome nostalgic feel from the game great voice work and music but also you get the connection to wowbuywarcraft ii is the game that really put blizzard on the map
i honestly cannot recall a pc game that i was more obsessed with than warcraft ii
while it was not the first rtsrealtime strategy it was one of the first and it was my first rts
computers had advanced enough that made rts games possible
typical blizzard testing and retesting made this one of the best balanced rts games and despite over a decade and a half of other rts games this is still one of the best
my pc at the time could not handle the game and i literally bought a better one so i could play warcraft ii
many a late night of playing one scenario after another or the great campaign
still very highly recommendedi first played warcraft  four years ago and found it to be one of the most engrossing and enjoyable rts games alongside age of empireswhile it seems dated now it is also extremely playable and at times even challenging
the expansion levels are good although sometimes it blows if your hero character dies because then you suffer an automatic defeat
fortunately this doesnt happen very often to me since i keep my heroes well back from the actioncollecting gold and improving your units is still as enjoyable as ever and there are a number of ways in which you can attack an enemies base contrary to some views warcraft  is not simply a quotrushattackquot game
some of the levels in the original game can be defeated using the rush strategy but the expansion levels are harder and you have to try different tactics
basically i found the expansion levels to be very similar to playing the custom scenarios in that the enemy attacks more has multiple bases and can usually only be effectively stopped by building a series of guard towers and cannon towers to protect your basei have no hesitation in giving this game five stars
if youre the type of person who likes both action and strategy then buy thisgreat game for its time
i loved the basic rts concept
there was an amazing story line
this one included water vessels which were way unbalanced imo
great buy for classic warcraft fanscomplexity graphics bots gameplay story overall age although warcraft  and its expansion have come out within the last few years i still prefer warcraft  a bit more
yes the game looks kinda dated now but it is still a blast to play
the game was fun in that it never got too complicated or anything so that newcomers could always have a good time
the map editor was easy to use and the online play in the battlenet edition will keep you busy for a while
anyways if youve only played warcraft  then it might be difficult for you to enjoy this game since it is so old but if your willing to look past the graphics then youll find a real gemthis game proves that if a game is really good graphics dont matter the graphics in this may suck but warcraft has been the best and first  ever war stratigy if you havent played this game which is liek  people get it i remember playin this back in like  it was so cool but i got this online one its like  in one games it has warcraft  tides of darkness it has the expansion pack warcraft  beyond the dark portal and it has like a multi player theme play single player first and beat it just so you can learn everything   so buy this and keep warcraft alivealmost every game that blizzard ever came out with made game of the yearcoincidence
i think not
i love all their games
warcraft starcraft diabloif you want to get a hint what is big business all about if you cant understand why have the great personalities brought back to life in this game
persisted at their work when they could have long retire sit down  feed your mouse some cheese and go on
graphics is excellent game runs  wonderfully you have very lot of options different campaigns scenarios  around  trains and  cargo cars
you must master building transporting  cargo finances amp stocks and much more
you must be very accurate at  laying tracks because it is made somehow tricky plus you have to control  the steepness of the track very influential on train amp delivery  speed
you can also buy many additional buildings for your station which  adds good look and value to your company
i bought the game on second hand  so i havent got the manual because the first owner has misplaced it  would you expect from  years old kid in slovenia to read english  manuals
he probably threw it away
but if you are persistant youll get  into game quite fast
i think it wil stay your thrill for a long timesomeone gave me this game as a gift and i must say it is one of few gifts i actually kept and got enjoyment from
i have been playing this game for a long time now and can play it at anytime because there is always something new to learn and new ways to get rich and rule the rr business
this game is detailed graphically pleasing and requires some gamer skill
i am sure you can handle it if you are reading this reviewstrategy games are often games that require you slice your enemy into  bits blow up his tanks and mow down his peasants
its so wonderful to  find a fantastic strategy game that is at its root a monetary war instead  of a physical onein railroad tycoon ii you being with the famous  bampo railroad connecting cities in the northeast corridor of the us
you begin with single track determining which city needs which goods and  how to give each city what they want while managing your finances
as you  get more money you can build larger stations buy bigger engines beef up  your track system and morecities will offer you money in exchange for  building track out to them and the more cities you connect the more types  of goods you have to offer to other stations on the line
as you move on in  the game you can move on to different areas even building a network of  rails across europe
you get annual reports with your finances can  purchase stock in your own company or from competitors
you can buy farms  and factories invest take out loans but if you wish you can simply ride  the rails and move goodsthe graphics are great for a game from 
they are done in an organic old style with old videos showing events of  the times
you can build telegraph poles to speed station turnaround hear  about recessions and regrowth of economies issue bonds attempt mergers
the political climate even affects where rights are cheap or expensive to  buy
its a lesson in history as well as a challenging mental  exercisesome of the more advanced features are a bit difficult to  figure out but there are numerous web sites out there that will quickly  guide you through those situations
for most of the game its incredibly  easy to learn and the status screens tell you at a glance what is going  onyou can even customize your own map and play in another country or  in a mythical situation of your own devisingi recommend this highly as  a great strategy game for all ages that you actually come away with knowing  more than you did when you beganborg is one of the coolest ideas and trek releases that has ever happened
the story is captivating and the action is fantastic
john de lancie is once again brilliant as q the script and dialogue is hilarious
if you can get this game do it
you will love every single minute of it it is absolutely fantastic for fellow q fanswellwritten and with high production values and combining some of the best elements of star trek with a puzzlesolving game star trek borg is a musthave for fans of both genres
while some of the puzzles are quite  tricky and in this game you actually need to make some mistakes due in  large measure to john de lancies characteristically droll performance  quotmy name is qits short for qquot the game also stands up quite  well as a star trek installmenti was initially frustrated with this  product due to a bug in the software that prevents its being installed on  certain pcs but after downloading the patch when can we expect software  companies to actually finish the product before putting it on the market
and receiving some advice from simon amp schusters tech support which  was surprisingly easy to reach and helpful my irritation was dispelled as  i sat back and began to enjoy the gamebugs aside this game is a  great value
trekkers will not be disappointedmany racing simulations simply dont have the real thrill in themselves because their drivers can be turned into complete beginners which cant even sit behind the wheel
driver is different
you have to qualify for the  game and then the fun beginns
from driving around the city and getting  acquainted with it up to full adrenaline challenges against the cops  over   missions will surely be enough for quite a while
and the police  certainly isnt so stupid as it could be presumed  youll have to give  your best to outrun them
graphics and sounds are near perfect
oh and do  crash at least once  the crashes are so nicethe graphics are stunning in this cool game from gt interactive
always wanted to put the pedal to the medal and run from the cops
now you can
some of the missions will keep you on the edge of your car and the  replaybility is very good
get this gamethis the funkyist and phates game of the late s
it so much fun that ive recommend it to people that dont even like driving games
its like driving gta in d and just soo much better
and the soundtrack alone is  worth all the money
tanner rulesthis tremor pack destroys the official rumble pack in many ways performance made by interact which is a very well known rd party brand for ps ps gameboy and n here are the features it adds to your controlli dont like very light controlls because then i dont have any grip on the thing next thing i know im dropping the thing it adds weight to this controllerit works on all brand controlls even the original nintendo brandbatteries last a while ive been using mine a week and they just died outlow and high mode are exellent additions since if your batteries running low your your just an energy conserver they both work pretty well and on high mode it shakes just as realisticly and as hard as the original rumble pacthe memory card that comes with it is a bonus but it dosent mean you cant use your original nintendo pac it fits right in just like the one that comes with this tremor pac using the original memory card also makes it easyer to remove from tremor pac and makes it a bit less bulkythe switch from save to rumble feature is a big help this was the main feature that got this product way up no other shocking pac will do the same for your controlloverall this product surpasses the original nintendo brand pac in every way you cant get anything betterthis was purchased as a gift for my daughter to use on her electronics

thank yougreat for extending the cable for the nintendo  n controller for nintendos gaming console the nintendo n by nintendo

maybe
but a great cable nonethelessit is sturdy

it does exactly what you think it should do and does it wellprosextends n cable
what more do you wantconsno observable signal lossi got these to use in a project so they are mostly disassembled now
still work great for what im doingthese are between  feet and are great for getting back from the tv so you can play without hurting your eyes or sitting at a strange anglewho knew
i bought my copy of suikoden ii new about  years ago for thirty dollars
now apparently i can sell it for three times this
nonetheless i continue to hold onto my collectors
copy
the game is that goodthe game takes place a few years or so after the fall of the scarlet moon empire which was the setting for the original suikoden
the plot follows similarly a young boy becomes the leader of the side of right and must constantly do battle against first the forces of evil luca blight and second his best friend jowy atreidesblight
this begs the question why get this game since its plot is so similar to the last onewell for starters the gameplay continues to be great with the player once again asked to recruit the  stars of destiny along with a few extra characters particularly if there exists save data from the original suikoden
the battles are fun although a bit too numerous for my liking
the townbuilding section is more involved in the sequel and the rewards are better including an iron cheftype cookoff and well as a whackamole game a dance contest a dice game and other goodies
there are quite a few optional quests multiple endingsand other goodies awaiting as well
finally for those of you who wish to purchase suikoden iii keep in mind that you may load the save data from suikoden ii as well to open goodies in that gamethis game is increasingly difficult to find but if you can get your hands on it you will be greatly rewarded
good lucksuikoden ii is surprisingly one of the last classic dimensional jrpgsto hit a home console
as such at the time of its release not too manypeople gave it much attention
as time has passed though many peoplehave come to experience this game for themselves and see just how greatit is
i happen to be one of those people who did not experience the gameuntil much later after its release
despite this suikoden ii has enteredthe ranks of my favorite games of all time due to its sheer quality andimpeccable style for a dimensional jrpg
if youre wondering how in thehell i could say this game has impeccable style just take a close look atyour party in battle and youll see what im talking aboutgraphics aside this game has a lot to offer as far as gameplay is concernedone of the highlights of the suikoden series in general is the fact thatthere are many different playable characters to choose from
this means that youare able to have a great amount of control over what team members assistyou in battle and if you dont particularly like how a certain characterperforms in battle you can simply swap them out for another characterwith a battle party of six you may at first feel a bit overwhelmed withhow many commands you have to input just to get your characters to attackthe enemies in battle but this is negated pretty well with the auto battlefunction that you can select instead of individually inputting each charactersattack command
the nice thing about auto battle as well is that it only appliesitself for one turn so if your characters become low in health after one turnof autobattling you can go ahead during the next turn and command your healerto heal your party without having to worry about the battle continuously progressingthis may seem like a minor point to mention but it makes all of the differencewhen you are fighting monsters that can do heavy damage to your partyto me personally and id assume to many others who have played this game as wellsuikoden ii starts to become especially fun when your party acquires the castle thatthey use as their headquarters
this castle is essentially your central basein which your party plans their next objectives and more importantly whereyou are able to rest supply your team and change out your team membersat first your castle starts out relatively small with only a few residents anda simple melody playing in the background but as you recruit more members yourcastle will become bigger and bigger and new shops can even be added dependingon which characters you recruitspeaking of recruiting suikoden iis plot relies heavily on the fact that youare the leader of a relatively new army
as such your army doesnt start outvery big and you must recruit more members to grow in size
this is where anotherbig gameplay element comes into play
throughout the world or i should say continentthere are various characters who you can recruit into your army
many of thesecharacters can be used in battle but some of them cant as well
the characterswho cannot be used in battle usually setup residence in your castle and provideyour army with important services such as an armor shop a rune shop and even ablacksmith
these characters are possibly the most important to recruit as they makelife a hell of a lot easier since they are essentially shops tucked right into yourcastle
with all the possible  characters recruited some of these  join automaticallyso its more around  that you can recruit your castle essentially becomes theprime place to prepare for battle and stock up on equipment
a few of the charactersyou can recruit provide you with optional minigames as well making your castle aplace to relax as wellsomething quick to note is that the game features three distinct types of battlesthe first is the standard onx turnbased battles that occur the most frequentlythe second and a personal favorite is the duel battles which involves your characterfacing an opponent oneonone in a duel until one of the two has their health bar reach last but not least are the war battles which appear at first to be in the form of astrategyrpg with grid and all
after some time however it becomes apparent that thesebattles dont require too much strategy to win but they still add to the game nonethelessas far as story goes i will keep this brief as to keep it relatively unspoiledthe plot involves the main character riou as he overcomes the trials and tribulationsof being rejected by his homeland which has become a land ruled by a madman whothirsts for power and cares very little about the lives of people in general
if this sounds vague and hard to understand then good
id hate to spoil the plotbecause it is very well written and worth experiencing in full for yourself
overall the plotline of the game really hooked me the first time i played the gameand the writing of the characters and story are very well done and believablemusically this game is quite fantastic
if you have ever played the first suikodenthe composer for that game miki higashino has returned yet again to provide a stellarmusical score for the sequel
everything from the world map themes to the town themessound great and they are even nice to listen to when youre not playing the gamethe opening theme and name entry theme in particular have a very epic feeling to them thatdoes an impeccable job of getting you pumped up to play the game
this is a greatthing because that means that the game starts out with a bang as far as music is concernedand it certainly doesnt stop until the endas much as id like to say that this game is flawless all great things come with a crutchfor suikoden ii however this crutch ironically happened as a result of what i can onlyassume was a semirushed localization and not the result of an error on the creators behalfyou see suikoden ii is missing a few things
the things that suikoden ii is missing unfortunatelyincludes music and dialogfirst off the translation of the game seems a tad sloppyits nothing major usually such as a minor typo or grammatical error in the scriptat a few points during the game however during an important scene in particular a characterwill speak in garbled text which im not exactly sure how it happened but it could beassumed that these lines were never translated to begin with
it doesnt happen all toooften mind you but it is important to note that it does exist within the game which is ashamethe second thing is something that i personally am disappointed by which is thefact that some of the songs in the game are entirely missing
during the localization ofthe game something must have happened that made some of the music not play when it wassupposed to
this is most evident during many of the war battles which happen to besilent when a song should be playing in the background
its unfortunate to me to seethat some music didnt play in the game but all in all it is something that i canget over in the end and many themes in the game still do playas you can probably tell by now i love suikoden ii and if you gave it a shot id evenwager that you would at the very least like it as well
you may not find it to be asspectacular as i did especially if you arent very keen on japanese rpgs
but ifyou happen to be a jrpg nut like i am i can guarantee you that this game does notdisappoint
the gameplay music story and art that is contained within this gemcombine to create an exceptionally well done rpg that remains a classic to this daywhen this game first came out i had no interest in it
there was just something about it
i was more interested in the first with its more shallow plotline and lighter story than the emotional thrilling ride that the second gave
yet now that i have finished the second suikoden missing  stars my bad
 i can tell you one thing
this game is one of the best rpgs out therethe story is emotional and excellently put
i wont bother telling you of what it is since you can just as easily read about it but its heartwrenching and perfect
you literally feel for the characters
yet there isnt just deep emotions and sadness
i assure you that you will get a darn good laugh as well
whether from viktor and flik busting each other as they like to do during the entire game or from your own enemies yes they know how to make you laugh you wont just be upset youll also laugh your head off but be sure to pick it back up to continue playing the game
this game is not a dramafilled creation nor a lighthearted childs play
it runs the way a persons life would run  theres a war and you can expect sadness cruelty drama even stupidity but dont forget the laughs the romance failed most of the time and the funthe game plays smoothly as well
this game has not locked up on me not once unlike the first suikoden
there was not a single time when it froze or wouldnt work and my copy is an old one
it ran smoothly not pausing in the least
unlike some games where the game pauses before slipping into a cinema suikoden ii flows right into the cinema without a single pause
the entire game simply flows along without pause and without a single freezeupwhile the graphics are d and definitely outdated locations are detailed and specifically change
villages will go from standing to burned to halfrepaired to a point
your castle will grow rather than stay the same and you will be lost for  hours trying to figure out where everything is
in the cinemas the graphics are smooth and welldone though still a bit on the outdated side
music score is excellent
unlike suikoden which had some music that made you shriek and flee with terror suikoden ii does not have a single music score that made me cringe or even show signs of discomfort
each score is beautifully done and rather catchy too if of course repetative
despite its repatative nature however you cant be disappointed characters
thats right the  stars of destiny are here again and as usual each character is different
from a stuckup magewarrior to a cluelessbeyondrelief teleporting mage each character has their own personality and own abilities
furthermore each character will normally have something different to say depending on whats going on
for once the characters are not just robots they actually have life so to speak
you can truly love some characters and hate others and thats what you want in an rpg rightbattles are unique
there are three types of battles and each type is smoothly spread throughout the game
oneonone battles are rare but their rarity wasnt disappointing and i honestly didnt miss them
tactic wartime battles were often but most of the time there was a predetermined winlose situation disappointing but there are times when your brain is actually necessary
and finally your average fight monsters with your party battles
you get six people to fight against the monsters and combining their abilities can actually mean win or loss
combination attacks runes magic weapons stats range all of them are important in creating your party
you cannot just throw together a bunch of people and expect to win without doing something whether sharpening their weapons giving them tons of armor or placing them in the back row and hopefully out of harms way
for example a mage in the front will do no good since mages often have low defense but placing a highdefense warrior in the front can make for a living fighting barricade
i think suikoden ii is one of the few games where you actually have to use your headnow im sure youre tired of hearing me talk about the greatness of the game
of course it has its flaws
grammatical and spelling errors no doubt caused by translation problems are hilarious
so let us here it instead of let us hear it  there are also times when the wrong person is talking or the wrong person is spoke of
in the end however the problems arent so bad as for you to not figure it out in the end
they are also a bit on the rare side and do not make the game seem too errorfilled or childish
sometimes it can get a bit confusing on where you have to go and what you have to do sometimes things just seem to happen randomly with no direct idea of what to do
there are those traditional times when you just want to kick the character and scream duh
you idiot
and of course finding all  stars is a pain but thats the challenge of the gameoverall i think that the games flaws are far beaten against its brilliance
if you can somehow manage to afford it not everyone is lucky enough to get handmedown games from friends like me be sure to buy it
your money will be well spentill make this short and sweet
suikoden  is the greatest rpg of its time
for the max kind of graphics and overall game capabilities available at the time suikoden  did extraordinarily well
however if the game came out today id only give it a crappy  out of  rating
ff  blows this game out of the water
plus no game and i mean absolutely no game is worth over 
i sold my copy a year ago for  and just recently tried to buy the game again because of suikoden  coming out and i wanted the whole collection
i could not believe how much the game goes for online or at all for that matter
i dont care how rare a game is
as a matter of principle and good business ethics id strongly urge all people to not purchase this game unless the price goes downsuikoden  is a great game and im glad i grabbed a copy way back with the guide maybe i should sell my copy and take a tropical vacation
seems that these rare games are developing into collectors items more than games now
if you really want to spend  on a game your bordering on nutsbut buy suikoden part  cause its vital to fully enjoy this game
however this game is beautiful deep and captivating
i have played it thru several times you can even load your original suikoden data if you gathered the  stars in that game to add storyline and events to this title
greatest rpg series ever a must for a true rpg fancollectorkonamis suikoden has always been by favorate rpg series next to final fantasy
though the only reason i put ff above it is because of graphics
suikodens battle system is pretty tight
you fight with  characters at a time instead of the traditional  once your characters get pretty strong youll never have to waste much time on weaker enemies
you can just hit auto and all  charcters will attack at once
runes suppy a character with magic
though unlike most rpgs where magic is just a nonphysical attack in suikoden magic is pretty powerful
therefore the number of times you use it in battle is limited
suikoden features up to  characters
some returning from the first others brand new
of course when dealing with that many characters the only true difference between them is their appearance weapons and background
there battle options would pretty much be the same
some characters can do speacial tag team like moves with each other
example father and son etcthe game features  kinds of battles
normal and army
in the army battle your crew of however many you have at the time arespit into groups of  each group represents a unit
you can customize the groups to your liking
depending on what characters are in a group will determine how strong that unit isone of the funnest aspects of the game is its castle
it starts off as an abandoned castle
yet after you gain enough people it will slowly grow bigger and bigger until its a fullfledged towncertain characters may open resturants or innsshops etc
i personally have no complaints with the game
if you play games for fun and gameplay this is it
for those looking for graphics this isnt for youi have been playing the suikoden series for years ever since the first one was release i was hookedsuikoden  is nothing like the first release well there are  characters but that is just a part of suikoden in general so no big deal just makes it that much more fun
the story line in this one is amazing as for the characters i would recommend going back and playing the first
you will enjoy and appreciate this game much morein this suikoden sadly one of my favorite parts was always the cook offs
this game just has so much to offer it is unreal
this game has yet to be beat in my opinion and i am an avid gameri bought  copies of this game when it came out i was that hooked to it i did not want to take a chance on losing it or having my disc damaged
i lost all but one and still play it to this day
if you have  bucks laying around do not hesitate buy this game noweasily the best rpg i have ever played
graphics are not the best but the battle system immersive storyline great music detailed cities and unique characterizations are phenomenal
unlike many future rpgs the load times for suikoden  are very short most likely due to the substandard graphics
if you can get over the graphics the rest of the gameplay is incredible
the plot is unforgettable and collecting the  stars of destiny is challenging and fun
many sidequests secrets and player choices make this rpg one of my favorites to this day
suikoden  is a classicnot much to say here that hasnt been saidthere is definitely a reason why you cant find this game for under  bucks these days
im so glad i picked it up when i did
i had already owned and loved the first game which was an impulse buy for  bucks at walmart and saw this one was out in babbages but kept putting off buying it
thankfully by the time i did they had some left
i didnt know it was so rare back then
the intros to this game meaning the start up cinematic and the credit scene when you actually start playing are two of the best scenes and musical compositions ive seenheard in my gaming history
i just love the music in the suikoden series but parts  and  definitely blow out all the later games
anyway suikoden  is definitely the high point in the series
if you decide to pay the big bucks for it youll be justifiedwhen i look back now at when i bought this game as well as several other great games i cant remember exactly what inspired me to buy it
what i do know is why i kept it
suikoden  is not only the best game in the suikoden series its also one of the greatest role playing games to ever grace the market
the story is rich and immersive the characters memorable and iconic and the battle system is classical perfectionthe game puts you in control of one of the two main characters who although they are best friends have opposing destinies
when their own country betrays them for an excuse to go to war the two start on a path to try and find their place in the world trapped between the home that betrayed them and their sworn enemiesa lot happens during the course of the story not unlike the drastic changes that would take place during a war
yet the story never stretches itself thin
it keeps you interested in every step up to the final confrontation
the game also takes advantage of genius war tactics that were used in actual campaigns in history as part of the storythere are also the customary  characters that are collected through out the game
some are support characters that will add functions to your army and dimensions to your base castle and most of them are playable characters that you can use in battle
each of the characters even if shortly introduced are memorable and full of dimensions that are sometimes established with only a few short sentences
even in such situations the characters are rich with life making this perhaps the best cast in any suikoden game
each character is animated in an animeesque style which makes sense it being a japanese game
even if you are not a fan of the style of art it is the perfect face for the game when you see it all togetherthe battle system in the game is traditional rpg turn based format
but they use the turn based system to perfection
there are six characters on screen  in the front row  in the back
characters in front can attack freely but characters in the back row can only attack if they have long range weapons such as a bow
characters that share some kind of history or know similar fighting styles can team up to do combined special moves
these moves range from being simply entertaining to completely devastating
charactes who cant attack from the back row can still function as fighters if they have a combo attack with another character
this adds a well rounded strategic element to the set up of a conventional group since characters with combo attacks usually need to be in the same row or in the same column to perfom their attacksi have beaten this role playing game multiple times and still find it just as entertaining as the first day i picked it up
it is truly a gilded great and thats not just a funny phrase
anyone who has looked for this game in recent years has probably found it ranging from  to 
i will certainly say i am grateful i never sold this game and if you ever obtain it you will not be disappointedone word
perfect
has all genres of a good story
betrayalcomedydramaactionand even some romancewhat more do you wantthe only frustrating part about it is looking for all  characters but its completely worth it for two reasonsgives you the perfect ending which satisfies and ties up any loose endsthe more characters you have the more fun you have in the castle you earn in the gamethis game is so creative
just take my advice and play this game
i couldnt resist this game to start playing more than  times
hahahai got this game when they were still selling it at toys r us
so man im glad i did not give this game away or i would have to spend the ridiculously high price of  bucks but this game is completely worth it and there are absolutely no flaws
just plain fun and emotional suikoden  does not suck however compared to suikoden  and  it is not that great
i remember playing  again for the  stars of destiny then playing  for the  stars of destiny and after doing it i realized how terrific of a game this issuikoden  and it feel extremely alike you can still love the characters and the relationship between joey and hero is tremendously powerful
now i didnt fully appreciate the ending until i got the good one
there are  different ones
one is lame one is semi okay but sad slightly and the best one is a tremendously great and happy ending even sad to see it end so wellthe game plays just like number  if you are query me about number  because you dont want to play it shame on you
you should go find suikoden  somewhere and play that first otherwise forget reading this review
ok so you can meet up with alot of new characters old ones and there are new minigames
the castle is large but easy to get around
it gets better and better as you get more guys and progress more
i loved the army chef battles a parody off the iron chef show
the fighting was tremendously fun
with great runes that tell damage and healing factor and great sprite animationsi really dont want to give anything away
there are different things you can do to make different outcomes i would play it once without cheating and then play it again with a faq to get the best ending
you can do different things sometimes that actually affect the outcome
you can even run away or back out of stuffmass battles are fun in this one
first game had awesome battles but this one has extremely nice ones that are fun and slighlty addictive as you get more characters and new things to try outget the game have fun with it
enjoy the d suikoden games forever if you canthe original suikoden remains one of the playstations finest early roleplaying games a pleasant mixture of traditional rpg gameplay and strategic planning
this sequel builds upon the respectable framework laid by the first title adding a far more complex plot and refining the games graphics
you assume the role of a valiant lad in the midst of a brutal war and you are fated to reunite the  stars of destiny to end the strife encompassing the land
while its predecessor features a few minigames to dabble with suikoden ii assaults you with an unbelievable assortment of diabolical diversions
several games of chance a rock climbing adventure and an iron chefstyle cookoff are merely a few of the many ways to extend your gaming experience
roleplaying fans looking for an exceptionally deep and lengthy quest need not look any further for this game has precisely what you needi really enjoyed playing suikoden ii and consider it a fine addition to my rpg collection
while neither suikoden nor suikoden ii seem to be rated with the upper echelon of outstandingly stellar rpg the storyline is engaging the characters are interesting and the graphics are cool
the graphics are so good in fact that players of the first suikoden will recognize some old friends just by seeing them on the screen
the goal is still to try and recruit as many characters as possible and you will have to go on a few side quests here and there to get them all
but its worth it to unlock the entire story
there are also some special characters you can get who are not mandatory to your quest but are fun to take into battle
i dont think youll be disappointed with suikoden iiif you dont buy this game now you are a crackhead
this is easily the best rpg ever to grace any videogame system
this game far surpasses anything even today
the only complaints i would have with this game are the result of future suikodens giving fans what they asked for
namely jeane as a playable character more of her boobs and less clothing
mcdhol makes an appearance in this as you can load the save game from the first suikoden a very original idea
much of what needs to be said has been said by others
if you dont add this game to your collection you belong in a psyciantric hospitalafter beating the game all i could say what quotwowquot  where to even beginthe storyline is fantastic and incredibly involving
it  has enough plot twists to keep your head spinning but its never  confusing
i hope everyone that played the game watched what was after the  credits
one of the biggest plot twists happens at the very endeven  though it is a great wordy story its also fun
there are few things  that are less fun in a video game than sneaking around being stealthy and  solving puzzles
the weapons never disappoint and the boards are never  repetative
sometimes the puzzles get a little bit difficult but that  gives it a fun edge to it if you dont throw your controller at the tv like  i thought about a few times hideo directed this so beautifully
i  have never seen a video game before that actually had a movielike feel to  it or an actual directing stylethe game is for a very mature crowd  though
im not saying a younger crowd couldnt enjoy it but the subjects  the touch on in about the last  minutes of the game might not mean a  whole lot to say a  year oldthe game is still fantastic
rent this  game asapthis is no doubt konamis greatest workthe graphix are great for a ps gamethe storyline has to be the best i have ever heard of for a gameyou can really tell that konami put alot of timethought and feeling into this onethe gameplay is great and the game is preety long and since the plot is so great and the way it unravels just makes you wanto keep on playing and playingi first played this at one of my friends housethe ai  though is kind of pathetici mean you can be behinde a few boxeslook upaim at a bad guys leg and shoot him and he just goeshuhwhos thereso i shot him a second time to see what he was doing and the second time he actually started to walk towards me and then he sayshmmmm and then he turned around and walked back to where he was standingafter that i got mad and i ran all the way up to him when his back was turned and i kicked him and he goes huhand then after about  seconds he finally turned around and saw me and then i killed himso i hope just because i told you that the enemys are stupid that that wont keep you from buying it because this is still a fun game and the enemys do get a little smarter if you select hard modethe bosses are great and well thought up and you even get to learn alot about there privet life when there not trying to take over the planetlikesniper wolfit talks about her and it even talks about one of your team matesoctagonfalling in love with herits funny though because after you kill her you have to listen to him whine about her death and stuffoverall this game is greatfunand has some replay value alsoi recommend this game to everyonethere is a reason manylike meconsider this game to be the best psxnaybest game everin fact there are many reasonsone reason is the incredible storythe story is phenominalyou play as solid snake infaltrating a base in alaskayour mission is to save to very important hostages and destroy the most dangerous weapon on earthmetal gearthe voice actors are fantasticnothing short of superbthe story is loaded with wise sayingsinteresting charactershumora littleromancesadnessand fearanother reason is the fantastic gameplaythe stealth is something innovative and welcomeyou really shouldnt shoot everyoneno matter how temptingbecause they will call for backup and most likely kill youweapons are fun to use and items help make it easier to go alongthe ai

could be so advancedthe graphics are good by todays standardsbut back wen this game came out no detail was sparedthis game may be loved widespread but in my opinion not the right choice for everyonethanks for readingprosvery interesting and well done storyyou use stealth instead of force in the gamevery fungood controlslong interesting and entertaining cutscenesdone like a spy dramacan go in st person veiwa good portion of bosses are hand to hand combat for fighting fansa story of betrayl death and deceptionmultible endingsother games than story modeyou have communicaterhigh replay valueconssome other characters in the story get repetativemight affend gulf war veteransthis has the best plot in a story line ever and this is better than mgs  on psplaystation everything is great charactersvoice acting music intence stealthif your new to stealth games plot twists boses and many moretheres tons of originality and this has got to be the best game of all timethe metal gear solid series is one of the greatest series of video games ever made and this is where it all startedfrom the story to the graphics and to the music and settings this game will amaze you
the production values and quality of this game are tremendousand the gameplaybrilliant
as those guiness guys would saythe key to this game is stealth and not all out running and gunning
if you fight upwards of two guys at a time you will die
its pretty much that simplebut to help you in your stealth mission is a boatload of cool gadgets that would make james bond blush
you got silenced handguns and machine guns
thermal goggles
night vision goggles
mine detectors
and the simple yet fun cardboard boxesevery item in this game has its own special and unique uses from ketchup to cigarettesand the best part of this game are the boss battles
each boss is truly unique memorable and a joy to fight
you will have a blast from psycho mantis to the ninja to the climatic battle vs the towering metal gearthis game was voted as the greatest playstation game of all time by both ign and gamespot and for good reason
it is simply one of the best games ever made and already a timeless classictheres nothing new that i could possibly say about this game other than its really really greatthis game is just the best game ever to hit the ps and waaaay ahead of its time as far as realistic storytelling
it just doesnt come any better then this
experience it if u haventas a gamer i play plenty of games each year
some are good few are great many are mediocre
almost none live up to the standard that this game has created
i played this game for the first time this year and it beats out everything else ive played   i just cant put it down
i am only about  hours in and havent even reached the nd disc yet but i feel ive played enough to give a fair judgement of the game and its mechanicsi downloaded this game from psn to my psp and even without a controller this game controls quite well save for the shooting
using the psps control nub is kind of inaccurate when attempting to finetune shots
the game features many control options to choose fromthe story revolves around snake a secret agent who is trying to stop his former military unit from launching a nuclear weapon
the plot unfolds mainly through cutscenes and codec conversationslots of them
however i feel that the plot was interesting enough to make up for what may be a bit too much expositiongameplay revolves around stealth
although there are guns it is to your advantage to take out enemies quietly and one at a time  or avoid them altogether
you can go in guns blazing strangle each enemy one by one or hide from enemies all together  that is the beauty of this game
you are given many tools and gadgets to get the job done but it is up to you to figure out how to proceed
unlike many games today with only one right way to proceed there are many possible strategies to use to make it through the terrorist base
there are also plenty of boss fights which in my opinion are the best part of the game which are all varied and interesting as well as challengingin short mgs is simply a game you cant miss
if you go into the game yearning for something different from the typical action shooters of today you should be in for a treatprosinteresting storyunique innovative strategic gameplaychallening fun boss fightsgreat voice acting and musicdecent length for the price and age of the gameconsperhaps a bit too much expositionstory can be hard to keep up with at timesok i have always considered this game as the best game i have ever played and havent posted a review but why now
i recently have purchased and finished metal gear solid   i had such a high expectation for the sequel because the first one was such a great gamewhen there were hypes and information of mgs i wasnt interested in it at all because im a old schooler just into d games
however when i had a chance to play a demo at toyrus i knew i had to get this game for no matter what
so i ended up getting it the day it came out and was so amazed at the masterpiecestory line game play graphic music and fun factor all arated
the graphic was the best from that time where everythings based with color green
the amount of detail was almost insane to the point where you can literally see mice running around
the appearance of night visionthermo goggle gave a whole new look
the music was there to really raise this game to another height because the strongest point of this game is its story line presented through cut scenes
when these emotionalshocking cut scenes are coupled with arated music it really brings out the emotion and shock very effectively
it really brought vibration function to a new standard and believe me time to time it makes fun out of itself for being a game which didnt kill the game but rather added more spice to the game
each character whether proantagonist there were strong character development though it might be a short cut scene
however it was more than good enough you could literally be sympathic with the characters
still my favorite character psycho mantis oh man you just gotta play and see quotit feels nicequotthe biggest difference between this game and the second one is that the first one knew when and where to put the cut scenes
the first one was very controlled yet it was just right for the gamers to really appreciate the story flow whereas in the second one its just wasted use of ineffective cut scenes here and there not to mention ridiculous codec dialogues which literally not only stop from continuing its legacy but killed it
another biggest difference has to be the ending
the ending for the first one was really really rewarding i absolutely had this sense of fulfilled completed satisfied reward  you will know what i mean
the second one umm no commentwell what can i say  i could find no flaws from this very game well theres no such thing as perfect game there were little bit of flaw with ai but trust me its really nothing when you are being overwhelmed by this game
like this editor from egm said this game is about experience
absolutely it is
i have played variety of games import domestic and used to work as a game tester when i have to pick one game for the best of the best i pick metal gear solid without any hegitationplease do me a favor and dont miss out on this gem
enjoy itin many ways i always liked playing the original playstation since the amount of games that were mustplays to the undiscovered gems always seemed plentiful so you never felt like you didnt buy a machine for at most  or  games
metal gear solid was quite a fun and intriguing release and it brought a more cinematic telling into the stories and although short and plotwise it can get into philosophyspeak a bit too often though at least its easier to swallow than sons of liberty it was still one of the more unique play experiences found on the consolestory you play as solid snake whos sent to shadow moses island in alaska to rescue darpa chief donald anderson and armstech president kenneth baker as well as stop the terrorists plans on launching a nuke
but thats just the start of it as we get foxhound members special elite soldiers who went rogue a big beast of a machine and snakes own connection to the leader of the groupgraphics since this is the original playstation you kind of have to take everything at face value they look blocky now and lack the clarity of sons of liberty or the huge polish of snake eater but it was on a lesser console so it makes sense
but at the time it was impressive with lots of cutscenes done very movielike and indeed the environments were well handledsoundmusic along with the lunar series the mgs series has always been prime examples of how voice acting should be done
instead of overeager voices or just robotic delivery its very easy to get involved with the story when the actors do a great job at balancing the quieter moments with the more plotbased information
the music does a good job as well though its used rather sparinglygameplay unlike other games were its encouraged to go crazy on your enemies the mgs series rewards stealth and nonkilling to progress
use tranquilizer guns or knock out enemies the object is to be seen as little as possible
even then you have a huge assortment of goodies at your disposal that inexplicably can be stored in snakes tiny pockets
from sniper rifles to  different kind of missile launchers automatics and handguns and goggles theres plenty to use should you get caught
aiding your ability to not be seen is the radar where a blue cone represents your enemys field of vision which you avoid though you can distract them by making noise such as knocking on wallscutscenes are wellhandled from fmvtypes which detail nuclear histories and such while theres others which handle the ingame cinematics like meeting characters
but snake also talks through the codec a radio and video communication which shows a black screen text and  character portraits and though its handy to read all the heavy plot scenes it feels strange for character moments
get used to that ring too since youll be hearing it a lot as you play the game
the other negative people might have is its length which doesnt really feel long and its actually perfectly paced and it doesnt feel like the game got extended just for the sake of adding more stuff to doalthough we have the remake with the twin snakes i felt the original is the best version and while graphically it shows its age its still an engrossing playthroughthe sony store has this game to download for around ten bucks
i forgot how blocky the graphics are and the peoples mouths dont move when they speak but that adds to the campyness of itthe one thing that bugs me is that the game is set up for the old ps controllers that dont have the two joysticks so the controller will not use those for movement
ive tried to find a way to make them work but to no avail
im so use to the joysticks that i forget and try to move with them all of the time which makes for some bad situations while im trying to make a fast exiti forgot how good the game was and its refreshing to play a low tech game i probably wouldnt say that if it wasnt as good as metal gearreal time cut scennes something that was practically unheard of in the day of metal gear solid and while the lips annoyingly refused to move the camera work was epic sweeping dynamic and everything an action flick should be
metal gear solid was indeed a revolutionary title and the first video game that i played with grade aaa voice acting
of course i hadnt played legacy of kain at that point
the directing in this game is its biggest accomplishment
hideo kojima needs to do movies
if movies these days could be even half this good id be less likely to complain so much
this is another add to my quoti wish theyd remake it for gcnquotalthough this game doesnt have the best graphics the story sound and gameplay more than makes up for that minute detail
solid snake is definitely one of the most if not the most coolest video game characters of all time
when i first started this game i was really nervous thinking all of this sneaking around in the middle of a heavily armed base would be impossible for me to do without getting caught every  minutes
but i turned out to be better at stealth than i thought i guess i have my game quottenchu stealth assassinsquot to thank for that
this game was not only full of action but the story was the best one ive ever come across in a video game it was unsurpassable until the sequel came out
the enemies were really cool too especially the cyborg ninja vulcan raven and the totally badass liquid snakeall i have left to say is get this game
if you have only part  and enjoy its plottwists action and gameplay then quotmetal gear solidquot is a game you must haveplayed this game a lot maybe too much sort of have an alter ego now but that is everyone elses problem all beware i am snake lol you need to put it up for a little while when you start having dreams though for the sake of societyin my opinion this is thee best video game ever
a game that encourages you not to shoot but instead to sneak around
very chilling exciting fun and entertaining
you play solid snake a combo of bond and snake pliskin character type
you enter the enemy compound to do many tasksi would rather not spoil the fun by telling anything to ruin your fun
let me say if you do not own this and you like games and you like spy games or games of this nature then you need this and will not be disappointed
it is a great storyline and an awesome game which make for good and intersting fun all aroundmany gamers know the words quotmetal gearquot to be associated of the truly innovative nes title released some ten or eleven years ago
truly revolutionary for that time it was the only action game that didnt allow you to just go running around looking for fights otherwise the same thing that would happen in real life to a oneman army would happen to you in the game
it made you think
few games do this and thats what makes this game no this franchise so greatmgs follows te neverending story of one solid snake a oneman army working to stop terrorists from an organization named foxhound from launching a nuclear warhead from a killing machine named ltgaspgt metal gear
although this game may seem too hard for even a seasoned gamer thats because theyre approching the game the wrong way
you cant expect to go the whole game without getting caught by a guard or without not quite knowing what to do
thats where this games real beauty kicks inthe cutscenes taken right from the ingame engine work flawlessly with gameplay to give the feeling of playing a movie more than a game
the player must use stealth tactics or heshe wont survive the first level which is believe it or not the easiest one
the game gets progressively harder but you never get discouraged enough to just give up
it keeps bringing you back for more
there are weapons aplenty and just because you wont be using them much if youre smart you better get anything you can
lthint chaff grenades are really handy against certain bosses like ninja and vulcan ravens tankgt  if you dont like using your head you wont like this game
one last tip the codec system used to communicate with others is a valuable too against bosses
use it whenever you dont know what to doratings  graphics  truly remarkable
you can even see snakes breath when its cold in a certain area
sound  all the sounds are in there and the noise you make also affects whether you get caught or not
control  superb
snake handles like a welloiled something
some innovative ways to use both controller ports by konami as well wait til you fight psycho mantis youll find out
funocity  did you expect anything else
overall  out of  its just too good to deserve anything else
be sure to pick this one up if you havent alreadya friend let me borrow the game and i was amazed
i requires a heck of a lot of strategy
i am still waiting for a game like this for my ps
this is the only game that got me away from play madden   basically you go threw a bunch of missions so you can destroy metal gear which is a nuclear weapon
the game not only includes killing and adventure but also tries to teach you about the nuclear weapons and power
i think getting this game for  is a steal
if you have never played it definitely buy it and play it on normal or hard mode
it will waste the adventure to play it on easy
it took me around a month to beat playing it about  hours a day
only negative is that there is a lot of talking in the gamewhen this game first came out and i played it i did not think too highly of it since i was used to action games and did not understand the espionage part of it
but after recently buying the compilation with the game is in it i realize all that i was missing even  years after its releaseof course the graphics are not on par now days but it features some of the best for its time
the way the game is set up it is revolutionary sexy ladies snake smokes so you can see the lazers psycho mantis nuff said dont want to create any spoilers for those whom didnt play the game but the way to beat him would stump anyone the first time through since it involves messing with your playstation hardware literally or else he is invinciblethough there are adult themes and bloody scenerios but thats why this game is rated mature
but the way this game is set up it is still a classic and a blast to play and replayintroduction metal gear solid was released in  and it became instantly famous
its great graphics for the time wonderful story and its fun gameplay made it a hitgameplay you are solid snake and you have to infiltrate through a huge terrorist base threatening the us for money and big bosss remains
you have to be sneaky and stealthy for if a guard catches you a hoard of enemies will come and try to find and kill you so be carefulyou will also get some cool weapons like the socom which is a powerful gun and the nikita a remotecontrolled missile launcherboss fights are fun and unique from the gunduel with revolver ocelot to fighting a tank and helicopter on foot to having a fistfight with a robotic ninja the bosses are awesomein the game you will get a camera which allows you to take pictures and discover ghosts
but you need a block per pictureif you ever get stuck contact your buddies on codec a cool communication system that allows you to talk to people like the general meiling who saves your game master who looks like wesker off resident evil and moreone more thing the torture event
you have to tap circle rapidly to restore your health
you can submit but if you do meryl the hot tough woman that snake loves dies
ocelot says if you use autofire hell know
hes lying
turbo controllers are safe and are necessary for this partgraphics well it looks like standard playstation graphics
polygonal and grainy
but it was good for the timemusic the music in the game is very suspenseful and catchy
especially the boss music
better than the remakessound the voices are very well done and the sounds are pretty great toostory the story unfolds through cinemastyle cutscenes which were new for gaming at the time and codec calls
the story is very rich and greatly crafted if not a bit confusingoverall one awesome game which is a must have for your collection
also get the sequels and the remake the twin snakes
i love this gamethis is probably my alltime favorite game at this point and as ive had it over a year now and ive been playing video games since quotpacmanquot was a major hit i can say its pretty goodpluses are being able to sneak around to avoid combat unlike a lot of games where the enemies run right at you when you enter a scene cool weapons an awesome storyline and a soundtrack that is beyond cool listen to the intro and ending songokay if youve played the old bit nintendo games of metal gear you are going to remember quotsolid snakequot as he battled the forces of outer heaven
now the graphics have improved and so the game has a real quotfeelquot to it and youre silenced pistol is your best friend
there are two secret items in the game
one is an unlimited ammo bandana and the other a stealth suit
and if you beat it twice on the same save something else happens think james bondcant say enough good things about this onemetal gear solid has the most complex and often perplexing storyline i have ever seen in a video game hands down
it will always have you on your toes literally
i have seen many movies and i can honestly say this game has a better storyline than most movies
here is what you need to knowgraphics  the graphics were top of the line when this game first came out and even to this day they look great
there is so much detail to every aspect of the game and even compared to most newer games this game wins out
back when i first played it in about early  or so the graphics were the best the playstation had to offer and thats a year or so after this game came out which is pretty astonishing
there is even a scene where snake is in the girls bathroom and there is a mirror which perfectly reflects everything
i mean back when this game came out that was a pretty big feat both graphically and attention wise
most games just dont pay the kind of attention this game doessound  perfect
just flawless
there isnt much of an actual soundtrack but the music is incredibly atmospheric and will make you feel like you are solid snake infiltrating a nuclear base
the voiceovers are the best i have ever seen in a video game
solid snakes voice over is perfect and just about everyone elses fits their personality and there image
otacons fits him perfectly so do meryls and liquid snakesseriously though this game has incredible sound and has never been surpassed by any action game to dategameplay  i have heard people complain about the poor camera views limiting the gameplay but in my opinion the camera views perfectly fit this game and the game wouldnt be the same without them
sure it would have been nice to have a first person perspective while using the weapons but its all the same to me
i think it is perfectly fine having to shoot enemies in a third person view and it works better with the type of graphics that it has
when you are spotted enemies will storm in from all directions to stop you something that seperates this game from all others
this game gives you good reason to want to play it safe but still allows you you have some action packed fun as well if you want to take a chance that is
also this game has an incredible storyline but doesnt throw it in your face all the time
mgs drags the storyline on eccesively and bores you with excruciatingly long cut scenes and codec conversations
i remember using the square button to skip most of the cut scenes in mgs
the problem with mg is that the storyline is too complex for the good of the game
i mean much of it is pointless grubble and the game bores you by making you listen to conversations about crap that doesnt apply necessarily to the main storyline making it a waste of time
this game however truly has a wonderful  complex storyline that you will want to watch and listen to
every conversation and cut scene adds to the game flawlessly so you will probably never get bored although i am sure you will find yourself reading the codec conversations manually instead of listening to the people talk since they tend to talk rather slowly and take up a bit too much gameplayoverall  this game is as perfect as it gets and i have beaten it at least  times if not more
even to this day it is a pleasure to play and i dont think it will get old any time soonreally well crafted
like a movie but longer more fun and exciting
games like this will change entertainment
you must play this through at least oncemgs is one of the best games made for the playstation system there are not many people who would disagree with that
not only does the game of an enthralling plotline great characters and wonderful weapons but the controls are easy and fun to usethe game is smooth to play making it easy to switch from item to item without breaking a sweat
the story that goes along with this game has enough twists and turns to go with a hollywood movie
just when you think you know what is going on something else happens and throws the story in a totally different direction
that is what makes the game so good the graphics could be worse than they are and this game would still be amazingthe bosses are challening and the weapons are helpful to your quest
whether it is your motion sensing mines or your c which you can plant almost anywhere if you are really careful you can even plant it on the back of guards and detonate
 there are also many automatic and semiautomatic to make the game more fun
you can blow away a bad guy with a missle launcher or you can quietly sneak up and use your sniper rifle to take them out
anyway you fight this game is definately a fun and exciting adventure a definate mustthis is one of the most nearperfect games i have ever played
the story is like a movie the boss fights do not suck the way you progress through the campaign is kind of like zelda and metroid which is cool
get this if you love action games movies or just games in generali had never heard of this game until i purchased a copy of zone of enders for the ps
and after doing some reading about the game on the internet and playing the metal gear solid sons of liberty demo i decided to check out the ps metal gear game
to simply put it this game is the best game i have played to date
i found this game to be much better than oni for the ps in fact
the puzzle and bosses on this game were very different and possessed depth of character
some parts of the game were frustrating particularly fighting metal gear rex at the end of th game also the torture scene was pretty hard too
but i cant wait to see metal gear solid sons of liberty come out this year
i know it will be one of the best and highest selling games of all time regardless of the videogame platform
this is definitely an innovative and original game that sets new standards for others of this type
buy it and you will see what i am talking aboutthis was my first video game that i ever played as kid even before mario lol
this game was something out of the movies for me and it set a high standar for all video games for ps for me
i can only count the fingers on my hand of how many games that can give this game a run for best game on the pspros
everything on this game is a top notch
the graphics of its time were superb
the story telling was excellent
the enemies were plentiful and the combat was awesome
there was plenty of boss fights that i loved if you read my other reviews you would know that
multiple of goodies were added on after you beat the game so i dont know where you can go wrong with this gamecons
this game is perfect
periodthis game was the reason why i play video games because i trying to find gems out there like this one but its hard to find a diamond among coal sometimes i guessthe cons for this game under description products stating that  puzzles can be frustrating and that torture scene too intense for younger gamers
to me this was stupid
most of the easy games can be boring
this game gets you be involved in the story and its very easy too follow if you are a serious gamer
also mature games are supposed to be harder than kids games
the puzzles are not that frustrating if you can think maturely even kids can pass this game with any problem
about torture scene too intense for younger gamers i think there is a reason why they labeled this game mature
mature games are not for kids
this game is one of the best ive ever played
great story great collectioni got this game a few years ago and was unsure of it for a while
for me the controls where kind of hard to figure out since i only had a few other games at the time
i also thought it was hard in generalbut then i figured out all the controls and once i figured out what i was doing i loved itthe main character who you play as is solid snake from the old nintendo games metal gear and metal gear 
metal gear solid and metal gear solid  are not remakes of themsolid snake is a tough ruthless guy who isnt afrid to take someone down
your archnemises is liquid snake along with his main henchmen revolver ocelot sniper wolf raven and psycho mantisyou can keep in touch with other characters who help you throughout the game on a quotcodecquot
two characters that are actually at your side during the game are meyrl and otocananyway the plot is very detailed and there was obviously a lot of thought put into itthe graphics arent that great now but at the time i bought it i thought they where pretty good
but it was made a few years ago so of course the graphics were not as good thenif you had a nintendo and owned metal gear and or metal gear  i highly recomend playing thisah yes the legendary metal gear solid series
it was originally a classic on the msx computer in japan but the series became really good when it debuted on the playstation
developed and published by konami with hideo kojima being the director and producer this was the first game in the series to become very popular
the games ground breaking graphics addicting gameplay challenging stealth action and its amazing storyline heavily influenced games that would later produce well detailed story lines
it was originally released on playstation but would be rereleased on the playstation store as a ps one classic a remake on the gamecube and there was even a port on game boy color which apparently got good reviews i find that hard to believe ill have to check that out some daythe storyline is the most complex and most detailed of any video game that was released at that point
there are tons of cut scenes character dialogues and we didnt see a game like this back then
the story takes place in  about six years after the events of metal gear  solid snake and  years after the events of the first metal gear
a genetically enhanced special forces unit called foxhound has invaded a nuclear weapons disposal facility on shadow moses island in alaskas fox archipelago
the forces demand that the us government turn over the remains of big boss within  hours or they will launch a nuclear weapon
big boss was the main antagonist in the first two metal gear games who is one of the greatest soldiers who ever lived
the terrorists want the body so they can take his genes and put them inside the soldiers so they can become an army of super soldiers and take over the world
the main hero solid snake is forced out of retirement and is sent to go to the island and stop the threat
i wont say anything else about the story because my reviews are always spoiler free you have to play the game to see it for yourselflike with super mario  and the legend of zelda ocarina of time on nintendo  metal gear solid was making a leap into the third dimension and the graphics for their time were very well detailed and the game has aged pretty well
details such as seeing the characters breath in the cold very high draw distance seeing smoke from cigarettes or footprints in the snow is all in this game
the gameplay is very similar to the d metal gear games on the msx computer
the game is all about sneaking by without detection rather than a straight on shooter but there are moments where you do go in all guns blazing but its mostly a sneaking mission because going in guns blazing makes the game much harder
i like stealth games like this because it makes us cautious and can even be scary at times because everything is quiet and suddenly a security camera or guard spots you the alarm goes off and youre slightly startled and have to hide and hope they dont find youthe most innovative feature in the game is the radar which shows the terrain and your enemys field of vision
its very useful and youll see yourself looking at it all the time
but in some areas the radar gets jammed and you wont be able to use the radar if you are spotted so you shouldnt get too used to it
ways to get by undetected include crawling under objects hiding in boxes hiding behind walls and making noise to distract the enemy
the game also includes many gadgets and items such as infrared goggles night vision goggles mine detectors rations binoculars the famous cardboard box andcigarettesthe weapons include hand to hand you can choke your enemies to death use a standard pistol with a silencer grenades c machine gun proximity mines a remote controlled missile launcher a sniper rifle and even a stinger missile launcher which uses heat seekers to follow your targetthe boss battles are very epic and every one of them has a strategy to defeat and its always best to use your radio to contact your support crew for tips on how to defeat them
the radio is also used to provide info about the games back story and even the controlsthe game also features a training mode called vr mode where you can practice hiding techniques weapon use and sneaking
this is one of the best games on the original playstation and the only flaw i see with this game is that you cant aim in first person view mode which can make it difficult to shoot some of the enemies
but other than that the game is practically flawless it has great graphics is challenging and one of the most detailed story lines of all time
it is simply a masterpiece and a must play for any kind of gamerfinal rating  out of when i heard there was to be a metal gear game released on the playstation i was happy
i had been a long time fan of the series from the very first game on the nes and even through the crappy snakes revenge
i didnt know if that next generation of gamers would know anything about the series but i was hoping for a good game
my expectations were surpassed beyond anything i could have hoped for
not only was metal gear solid a good game it was a great game
metal gear solid is one of the best games if not the best game on the playstation and it should take its place as one of the top games of all timewhile previous metal gear games had suggested that stealth was the way to go and other games had used the concept i had never seen stealth developed as well as it was in metal gear solid
it was not only a good idea it was the only way to go
you needed to avoid enemies as best you could to be able to make it through the game
when you killed an enemy you had to do it in a way that nobody saw you or heard you
metal gear solid is called a tactical espionage game and it means just that
you are a spy and spies should not be seen or heardlike the other metal gear games you play as solid snake now the legendary solid snake
it is your mission to infiltrate the shadow moses island in alaska rescue a hostage and see what is going on
from the moment that you begin the game what you know is being tested and your place in the story is being escalated quickly
you are handed a lot of information about the plot and the reasons behind everything
this game has some very memorable scenes and memorable enemies
overall this is one of the best games on the system and i would recommend it to anybodyi will keep this short but if you do not buy this game or play this game before you die you will simply just have missed on the best game that have ever been created
anthats thatmetal gear solid creator hideo kojima is truly a genious in knowing how to wow people
the first time i saw this game was on a demo disc and it was in japanese which is always cool and after just watching the into movie i could tell that this was unlike any other game i have ever playedeverything while outdated in looks is so realistic
which is maybe why i liked this title so much
that and the characters are freaking amazing
solid snake is my hero and i wish he were a real person so i could meet him and get a picture of him a cardboard box
this is another reason why i like the game and the rest of the series the humor
while funny most of it still has a point
sure its funny to see a guy sneaking around under a box but its also very stealthy and strategic
as long as you dont move while the enemy is watching youre good to go
using the box is like an ongoing game of red light green light
except in this game you can pop out and break the guys neck
also knocking on walls is sometimes funny but all the time useful
knock on a wall to lure an enemy into a mine you secretly placed near a truck
there are countless ways to enjoy dispatching your enemies even without the use of weapons
leading them around circles with your footprints in the snow is also humorousbut enough about the comedy and onto the meat of the game
the story
while not all convoluted see also  metal gear solid sons of liberty
 the story still maintains a good conspiracy type theme involving the government and a rebel group of terrorists known as foxhoundthe members of foxhound are some of the most memorable in videogame history
the first revolver ocelot a gunsling sixshooting soviet that sadly loses a hand during an encounter earlier on in the game
vulcan raven a giant and shaman he wields a gigantic gatling gun and resides in a warehouse freezer where he talks to his fellow ravens
sniper wolf a sleek and sexy well sniper that has a reputation for always getting her target
psycho mantis a war guinea pig and avid gas mask wearer that also has psychic and telekenetic abilities
the leader of them all is liquid snake solid snakes brother
hes pretty much just an arrogant powerhungry jerk hell bent on world domination a good end boss to really get the urge to kill
other key players include  the legendary gray foxthe ninjaone of the coolest freakin creations in all of videogame history
his optic camo and razor sharp katana a gun later in the game are just too cool
he slices up enemies like theyre butter and looks cool as hell doing so
he is by far next to solid snake the coolest character ever imagined
but they wouldnt be nearly as cool if it werent for the story behind it all which im not going to get into youll have to buy the game if you want to know more about it
there is also a woman in the game named meryl who is an army brat and snakes love interest kindathere is also a vr training mission part to the game
it is quite fun especially if you have a very competitive relationship with a friend or family member that likes games
you can easily lose hours tryin to shave off a tenth of a second off your opponents time
my friend and i would spend entire days just playing the vr missions
after we couldnt beat each other anymore we called it a tie
there is a technical wizard you can watch go through all the various stages to give you a better idea of how you can get the best possible time
but if you are anywhere near as good as my friend and i got at the stages this techinical wizard will look extremely slow and stupid
manthose where the good old days
and the greatest thing is you dont unlock a damn thing for beating any of the missions just more variants of the same like doing them with weapons stealth cardboard boxoh well its still a great distraction
and its way better than the vr missions game that game out but in that you get to be gray fox for a couple missions which is amazing
cloaking and slicing people to ribbons sign me upthe cinematics in this game even by todays standards are some of the most well crafted to date
enemies are all introduced in an impressive manner and even scenes of pure information and dialogue are fun to watch at least the first time
the voice acting is superb and the whole thing comes off as something of moviequality work
this game isnt a classic for no reason
check it out and youll understand why
and if you cant stand the blocky graphics of the psone get the revamped metal gear solid the twin snakes for the gamecube
its the same tale with some minor added and changed stuff but nothing major
either way its well worth you money and so cheap for such a masterpiece
no one should be without a copy of this gamei love metal gear solid i own metal gear  and  on the hd
collection for my xbox and metal gear  to play on my ps
metal gear solid  i also play on my ps it is amazing i had a few problems with the camera but thats only because im used to metal gears and  but thats more of a personal problem if anything the game is just great in its story telling and game play a thing the metal gear has always done right
the voice acting is amazing and this game was made in  the graphics well i never really like talking about old games graphics because i dont know if that was good for back then or not but i would guess it was pretty amazing
the presentation is also very impressive right as you start out you will play as solid snake
who doesnt like snake
you can read the story from the previous games in the extras or something like that although i didnt always like this game because i wasnt that good at it but again thats a personal problem
truthfully it took metal gear solid  and  to make me a fan
then after almost beating metal gear  i came back to this
it was a lot more fun after becoming used to it and kicking butt
anyway im having a lot of fun with this game i reccomend it if you like a scifi story or if you like stealth games if you like either of these buy metal gear solid  and see if you like it then if you do buy and  because those games and this one are all must buysi dont want to drown you with hoopla so ill just tell you that my wife really isnt into games
she really isnt and im not going to say that metal gear got her to grab the controller all of a sudden because it didnt
what it did do is hold her attention indefinitely
for the first time ever she actually encouraged me to play play play
the storyline action yada yada yada is that good
really
im surprised a metal gear movie isnt in theatres yetthis is my best game
if you looked at my resident evil  review youll see why this is the best
but this game has everything i ever imaganed
good graphics cool weapons a man with courage and some lovely ladies lol just kidding
but your snake a official that worked for fox hound and you have been chased by roy camball so he can brief you on your mission that you well refuse to do
so he tells you to rescue some people and than start your mission
you will run into alot of people and lots of calls on your codec
one of your friends though is your deadly brother i wont give his name away
but this game has over  weapons and over  different items
you get to spy on people and surprise them by killing them
youll want to play this game agian and agian
its the best game for the playstation game consolethis game is probably one of the top  games ever
i personally rank it  and goldeneye as   the reason this game is so awsome is because of its movie like qualities
for a maximum impact you should play this game in long stretches with as few distractions as possible
this will litterely put you inside the movie
the plot is just awsome and it gets better as it goes along
it took my about a year to beat the game and a total of about  hours of gameplay
i did stop playing it for about  months win i got stuck on a level then stopped for another month when i got stuck on the last couple of levels
i still think they should make a movie series of this game
overall i think i would pay about  if i needed to to get this gamefirst of all im a goldeneye fan and i thought nobody can do it like james bond but even playing it for only  hours solid snake can really hold it down
there is alot of pure action and drama and in parts its like you are playing in the movie
the sound effects and graphics are excellent and i like the red laser on the guns and the radar
solid snake has more gadgets and better moves than bond
when you think about it the overhead cam does help you see around corners the controls feel awkward at first but you learn quickly
overall this game is the goldeneye of the ps and get it nowim going to start by saying that i only got this and the other two games because i was so confused in mgs
but im so glad i got this
it is definitaly one of the best games and one of the best games ive played
everything about it is superb
the boss battles the story the characters everything
though the dialouge can be a bit cheesy
the only thing i have to say against this game is the camera angle and graphics
ive been used to playing ps games with their amazing graphics so when i saw this it came as a bit of a shock
ive played other ps games around the same year with better graphics so im a bit surprised with how bad this games graphics were
but by no means does it take away from the experience of the gamethe camera angle on the other hand took away from the experience only if a tiny bit
it gets realy annoying when you enter another section of a room and the camera jumps to another angle when all you want to do is control it and move where you want it tobut one thing i really loved about this game is how much you care for the characters
i found myself trying to get through the infuriating torture scene when you have to hammer the o button unfairly fast just to save meryl
spoiler ive also played the ending where you find meryl dead and its just really upseting
i never care so much about game charceters
spoilerso overall this game is great in every way and id recommend it to anyone who loves stealthaction gamesi saw the word greatest hits and i was ashamed
why do they always ruin every game box with that stupid green bar on the left telling people its a greatest hits
mabye they will make more money wronganyways the actual game is my nd favorite of all time
not easy to get onto my list but this game does it
i was playing metal gear solid  the other day and realized that it can never compare with what this game has achievedyou are snake the operative who must go in a nuclear testing facility held by terrorists
snake goes in by stealth and must fight numerous villians
all the villians in this game are extremely well done with voice acting and great personalitys
i cant find big complaints at all with the gamethe game is so good that they are making the remake for game cube and possibly other systems
metal gear solid twin snakes
anyways the game has music that probably for me basically tops final fantasy  just because it is original and fits the mood perfectly
every character has perfect voice and personalitys so the voice acting never gets old
ive played the game like  times and i loved it every minutethe bad point is the backtracking but it is really short and is always for a reason
you backtrack usually with a goal in mind
and you will usually backtrack like a mofo on halloween
meaning really fast to get your candy
and every time you do itlike  times in the game you will get to listen to juicy codec calls that unravel more story bits and liven it upi love calling cambellwho is a great character on the codec to see what he has to say
it always seems to be different and intellectual
he can also give you hints and the other characters on your codec play major rolesthe best part about this game is the story
honestly rpgs have the best storys but this game can top almost any rpg in story
we learn about  snakes and how they believe things
liquid snake he talks about being a flawed snake and such and whenever he talks its always interesting to the point where i want to hear it every gamewith story comes philosophy
this isnt the matrix where we have a man called morpheous talk about philosophy in some crazy underground rave
this is solid snake and others being honest
solid snake has some of the best views on life
hes like a rebel without a cause
his lines are thought provoking and are probably things that someone could base their life off of
live life is probably the best message he tells and can give and this philosophy is rare in video games todaythe fighting is cool and bosses offer challenges and fun
i would reccomend this game to anyone
you will get your moneys worth from this game and i hope you enjoy it
but one more thing lets not forget what you must do
buy the game for playstation not computer
on computer they like changed the skins around or so ive seen in screenshots
solid snake looks alot younger and alot less vigilante like and stuff
get it on playstation to truly expierience itmetal gear solid in my opinion has to be one of the best games ive ever played
this game definately opened alot of door to games as we know them today
this game did to stealth action games the same as of what final fantasy did to rpg games
some of the puzzles and a few of the main bosses were pretty tough but everyone should like a challenge and youll get that with this
still a great game for its age and definately worth checking outi didnt buy the mgs hd collection because this was not includedhow can that be
mgs was the best mgs game ever
great stories game play konami how can you not include mgs in the hd collectionwhyyyyyy metal gear solid has all of the elements of a great thriller film
a twisting plot incredible voice acting and directing and interesting charactersfrom the very beginning gameplay is bliss
the control is spoton
simple to learn fun to play
the dual shock controller is taken full advantage of as well
wait until you feel the helicopter taking off and then wait for psycho mantis to prove to you he can make objects move
the game eases you into it and gives you a solid twelve to fifteen hours of gameplay the first time through
but you wont want it to end
i guarantee it
if you havent bought it already buy it now
this game would be a bargain at mgs is the best action game ever made
cool weapons a compelling story great graphics for its time and some top notch voice acting make this a classic that everyone should own
if you dont own metal gear solid you cant call yourself a gamermetal gear solid is the best videogame ever made
let me explain myselfits a third person actionadventure game that requires you to utilize stealth to survive
as solid snake a lone warrior you have to singlehandedly infiltrate shadow moses island a base recently taken over by terrorists to develop a nuclear capable walking robot codenamed metal gear rex
your job is to make sure rex never launches by any means necessaryit sounds like a typical third person action game but theres so much more to this gamefirst off the plot is flawless
hands down the most intricate well thought out and moving plot ive seen in any thriller movie ever madeyour main enemy the enemy most commonly seen in the game is the genome soldier
the genome soldier is a member of a genetically engineered army
if you stay out of sight youll never have to have a physical encounter with one of these guyshowever the boss fights cannot be avoided and thus its a darn good thing theyre so enjoyable
bosses range from normal human beings with dreams of revenge to individuals with slightly supernatural powers which adds an interesting twist to the game
every boss is fighting for their own perosnal reasons and their own motivesthe game will take roughly twelve hours to complete the first run through without a strategy guide
i advise you to listen to all the codec conversations and watch all the cinematics because this is where the game truly shines
its story
with six times the lenght of the average hollywood thriller the story is developed much more and the characters are fleshed out far better than in any film i can think ofthis game has my highest recommendationthis game felt like a movie when i first played it years ago
it does make a case for one of the best video games of all time
the acting voice acting combat stealth story cut scenes are truly amazing
very cinematic feel to the whole game  revolutionized gaming considering it came out over a decade agowelli just recently got into the world of metal gear solid started with  and played  last haha
but have always respected mgs as one of the best games on the psand now i know whymgs is all about sneaking aroundif you get caught its better to use a stun grenade and run in the earlier parts of the game cause you will die fastthe learning curve isnt too badthe first boss can be a bit hardbut after that its smooth sailing till near the endgraphics are nothing to write home about todaybut back in  it was cutting edge like todays mgs  but if your reading reviews then you know what to expectwith that said this by far has the best ending out of the  of them mgs comes really close story wise this is also the best of them all  have a good story in there own right if you havent picked this up yet or find the price to be too high for an older game get the mgsessential collectionyou get the first  mgss for but act quick as they do tend to sell out rather fastthe nd installment in the series that debatably started it all
memorable moments and stealthaction are found when playing this gemmgs is one of the best psx games ever madethe story is great and uniqe and hassuperb voice acting filled with great and detailed cut scenesi got this game the time it came out and yeah its a little to late to be reviewing this game but what the hell
metal gear solid is about solid snake who is trying to infaltrate a terrorist base holding a new type of nuklear warheads
metal gear rex
snake soon finds moor enemies and allies as this amazing progresses through
i personaly loved every charactermy most favorite was raven
the game is dramatic to the maxbut not as dramatic as sons of liberty
meryl was an awsome character too
snake has feelings for her but he wont admit it and more complications occur
the game is one of the best games i have ever experienced in my gaming time
the boss battles were awsomethe game is one of those games youll remember experiencing and the first time is the best
the characters are all great and the voice acting is not even close to bad
i wont spoil anymore for you but i also recomend getting twin snakesi got that game the day it came out and it did not dissapointeven though i found some stuff to be better in the original than twin snakes
for example the final conflict between snake and ninjagray fox wasnt as sad as i thought it would be in twin snakes
the speech was more moving in the original
but over all this game is great
and like i said may be the greatest adventure game ever mademetal gear solid can be said in three words
brilliantamazing fun
metal gear solid is one of hideo kojimas finest
it has a very superb plot superb characters and lots of great dialoug
metal gear solid was a very hyped up game in  and lived up to the hype
i simply loved this game
metal gear solid has bin called by man fans and gamesites as one of the best ps action games
i totally agree and i think its not only the best action game but also one of the best games ever created
it has a brilliant story line which i wont bring up since you can find time to read other reviewers since they pretty much tell you
the game is a stealth game
it pretty old stealth game acctually the game is about  years old
i was one of many fans to buy this amazing game when it first hit stores
metal gear solid earns its  for these things
story gameplay and villans
the villans in this game are awesome
from the moment you get to the ocelot fight to getting your hands on rex you will love this game
metal gear solid has bin one of the most popular playstation games and has spawned sequalsala mgs and now mgs  and what makes metal gear solid one of the best games is also the fact that metal gear solid has one of the best storylines in a game
sure there are some plot holes in the series but kojima did that for usthe fans to make our on theories and to guess and what not once the next one comes out
if youve had a playstation for a loooong time and dont have metal gear solid in your ps library then i donno what the hell is wrong with youmetal gear solid sums up to these thingsbest story line in a gamesome of the best graphics scene on the psyes its extreamly out dated but i still love the graphics in this game as it was the best in its timegreat stealth actionamazing level desighnmy favoritethe boss battlesjust awesome especially the finale with rexgood replay valueconsnothingwell i guess i should point out that this is a pretty short game
the first time through for mesince i looked around alotwill be maybe  hours second time through should take  hours or less
but that doesnt ruin the game at allthis game is a masterpiece everything about it is amazing and its even better then the remakei thought it wasit all comes down to metal gear solid as one of the best ps games ever and it totaly earns its out of  starssuperblatesin light of ps releasing an update that will allow upscaling of ps and ps games to p i feel compelled to revisit some of the games that made me a solid sony fan
mgs is one of those games that comes along once every console where the developers producers and screen writers all seem to be on the same page and create a masterpiece
this game was revolutionary in the sense that it focused more on the concept of espionage rather than the usual run n gun
i played this game back in  when it was first released and have been following the game ever since
this game made my jaw drop with the graphics it pushed out of the ps and the storyline is amazing
theres love hate plot twists dual endings and so much more that combine to make this game great
one thing i remember is the battle with psycho mantis a crazy military psychicwho knew every move you were going to do before you did it
at one point he tells you to put the controller down to see his true power and with a hardy yell my controller vibrated right off the coffee table
of course it was the rumble feature but how unique is that
we were all tripped out on the greatness of this game and the intelligence put into the storyline
this game is by far the best game on the ps and if you havent played it yet now its not too late
get it play it and then buy the others for the ps metal gear sons of liberty and metal gear snake eater
if you got a ps be on the look out for guns of the patriots coming out on march   its going to be amazingit had been years since ive played this game i dont really care for shooter games much but i like this one and this is probably the best metal gear solid i ever had the oportunity to ever play i played a demo of the one that involves a jungle snake eater i think i didnt care for it i forgot how unique this game was in getting the player involved
i have not beat this game yet since i got my recent copy i had to take a break but overall if your not a whiny cry baby about details in graphics this is a fantasic gamethis game is a total classic in every way
the plot the gameplay the characterseverythingmetal gear solid will go down in history as the best playstation game and one of the best overall video games everthis is without a doubt the best game in the seriesthis playstation classic had everything that was needed to make an excellent video gamegreat storyintresting charactersawesome gameplaywonderful music scoreeverything about metal gear solid was perfectsolid snake is now considered an icon thanks to this fantastic gameevery gamer needs to have this game in their collectionthe story of the game with it accompanying video sequwnces make the gamer feel as though they are almost playing a movie
this is just one of the great elements of metal gear solid
another thing that makes this game unique is that instead of just running around and shooting every enemy that comes your way you instead must rely on stealth if youre to be successful
finally the most rewarding aspect of this game is its near perfect gameplay which is about as faultless as a game can get
this is one of the must have games for playstationwe all know this game is awesome and whybut for new people to mgs series you need to play this one
its so goodsoooooooooooo goooooooooooooodeven though mgs is my favoritealso the shipping was quick yeahmetal gear solid is by far the best ps game ever created
heres the story you are solid snake a secret agent brought out of retirement by your former boss roy campbell to infiltrate a nuclear weapons disposal facility that has been taken over by a hostile group of terrorists and former members of a secret organization called foxhound
your primary objective is to resuce the darpa chief donald anderson and the armstech president kenneth baker
upon learning of the terrorists plans to use a new nuclear weapon capable of mass destruction snake must use his cunning and his stealth manuevering to outsmart his enemy and destroy the ultimate weapon metal gear
with an awesome array of weapons like the socom pistol the famas machine gun the stinger missle launcher and the nikita rocket launcher snake must singlehandedly infiltrate the heavily guarded weapons facility and find out about the criminal mastermind behind this plot
snake will also learn about his dark history which will prove that the criminal behind this plot is more than a match for snake
or is hebottom line metal gear solid rocksi remember as an yearold having the mgs demo that came with the playstation my parents got me
i remember spending hours running around the heliport and gunning down enemies
later on i rented this game once but only got so far before frustration overtook me i got to the level with vulcan raven in a tank
now ten years later i manage to get my hands on a used copy here at amazon i spent about  sh
all i can say is that its more than worth every penny i spentstory truly exquisite
you play as solid snake who is perhaps one of the most famous playstation game characters if not one of the most famous game characters of all time who is sent to shadow moses island in alaska to neutralize a terrorist threat pretty standard action movie stuff
but the story will continue to throw various plot twists that may seem random at first but add up in the end im avoiding the main plot elements just so i dont spoil it for anyone who hasnt played the game yet
graphics for its time this game had amazing graphics
the only ps games i can think of that had better graphics than this game would be the syphon filter series
sound crisp sound effects for its time wonderfully composed musical score and outstanding voice acting david hayter was especially good
gameplay i have played through many games since my first experience with mgs  years ago ive played through roughly  games throughout my lifetime
yeah i know im a loser with no life and this game still captivates me
if a game made a decade ago still manages to provide engaging gameplay after all these many years that is a fantastic accomplishment
but most importantly this game delivers a few good messages
examples would include the threat nuclear warfare possesses on the world as well as the meaning of life
sadly most gamers do not take these messages in and just sees mgs as simply a game
mgs is more than a game it is perhaps the first game to ever attempt a movielike feel and succeed
i hope this game as well as its creators konami hideo kojima and yoji shinkawa will go down in history as important figures in the gaming industryall i can say is that this game deserves at least  overall
with that said i cannot understand why jeff gerstmann decided to give it a score lower than that
i consider this one of the best games ive ever played and is even better than some of the newer games ive played gears of war and cod have nothing on this game
this game is even better than mgs even though mgs is a fantastic game in its own right i give mgs a  and im currently looking forward to playing mgs im planning to get a ps soon
the only systems i currently own are a playstation  and a highend pc
mgs is  hours of pure gaming blissmy only regret is not playing through this game earlier in lifeoverall score i will now summarize this review into  words you must play this gamea masterpiece from hideo kojima
the story and each of the bosses are ones of the best in video games history
gameplay is a mix of stealth and action
probably wont have a wow factor like it used to  years ago but this is a game that shaped video game industry
get it
you will love ituntil now ive never played a lot of the ps classics
i can safely say though that this game is awesome
no matter how many times i accidentally walk into a surveillance camera i still have a lot of fun sneaking around and hidingwhat can be said about this masterpiece
this game is utterly amazing in every aspect
the plot is full of so many details
it relates to things that we know about
not everything is just hoopla made up by the game designers
the action and the thinking parts of the game are superbly balanced
youre not just running around fighting people
theres parts were you have to be stealthy parts were you have to think
man this is just a milestone in video game history
and wouldnt you like to partake of the sweetness that is metal gear solid
i assume your answer was yes and the only way to do partake of it is to buy it
so do ithideo kojimas metal gear solid  is like a great classic film that has now become required viewing for movie buffs  this is required playing for gaming enthusiasts
it stars solid snake a weary gruff veteran of the battlefield with a deep gravelly voice who always keeps a pack of cigarettes handy just in case
his mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons facility on an island off the coast of alaska codenamed shadow moses which is currently being occupied by the exblack ops unit turned terrorist group known as foxhound
its not immediately apparent what the groups ultimate goal is and in fact one of the great pleasures of mgs is the way in which the story slowly unravels
many of the characters have secrets and motivations of their own some of which wisely go unexplained whats ocelot really up to
as a game made on ps hardware the gameplay holds up considerably well for its time
its played from a thirdperson topdown perspective
you can equip different gear rations binoculars on the lower left of the screen and weapons guns explosives on the lower right
stealth plays a big role as you constantly try to avoid alerting the patrolling guards
the best gameplay sequences involve the unique boss battles with the members of foxhound
these sections are fun because no boss or battle is alike and each character that you duel feels wholly original
the main draw and what makes this game and the series so special is the masterful storytelling that grabs ahold of you and doesnt let go
its the stellar voice cast including david hayter as snake the ingenious plot the phenomenal soundtrack and atmosphere  its the meticulously crafted world that you cant help being completely absorbed in  stars i decided just out of curiosity to check out the reviews of people who gave this game  and  stars
they all said the same thing and i agreed with some of it
ill be the first to admit that metal gear solid is short
skipping cut scenes i can be the game in about  and a half hours now
ill also admit that the graphics are dated however for their time they were amazing
sure ill even admit that some of the dialogue was cheesybut i will never agree that the plotline of metal gear solid is stupid slow or senseless
as a matter of fact i dont think there is a better story
of all the movies ive watched books ive read and games ive played ive never expierienced anything like metal gear solids storyline
twists turns shocks and surprises are all through it
sure there is a lot of watching but its worth it in my humble opinionfor those of you who for some reason are unaware metal gear solid is about a hero named solid snake
he is sent in despite retirement to rescue two people from a nuclear disposal facility on an island called shadow moses
the place is under control by the group snake used to work for foxhound
leading this ragtag bunch of freaks is liquid snake a man with the exact same face as solidbut liquid is not alone
psycho mantis is one of the games most intriguing bosses
he is a telekenetic with a love for throwing furniture with his mind
the battle with him actually requires you to change your controller to another port so he cant dodge your bullets
sniper wolf is a beautiful but deadly assassin whos target becomes her obsession once she marks it
vulcan raven is a giant shaman who loves heavy weaponry and can survive freezing temperatures with no problem
and then there is revolver
good old ocelot makes sure to cause you all kinds of trouble throughout the course of the game including torturing you with electroshock
and how could i forget ninja
although this mysterious villain is not with liquid he seems determined to slice and dice you
oh yeah and decoy octopus
but you wont know much about him until its too latebut you arent alone
there are two people who are physcially there for you
one is meryl a redheaded babe who just so happens to be your colonels neice
then there is hal emmerich also known as otacon
this geeky hacker gets you out of a ton of sticky situations in this game
even though they arent actually there the people you contact by codec help you out bunches
the colonel despite being quite shady gives you a plethora of tips to get you out of bad spots
mei ling a cute little chinese girl saves your game and fills your mind with interesting proverbs
master mcmiller is an interesting old friends of snakes who knows a lot of about the alaskan wildlife and wilderness
then there is deepthroat
this guy is quite mysterious but very helpful
oh and naomi
this sexy and sophisticated scientist is the reason for the technology that is keeping you warm in the cold climate of alaskathe things ive mentioned dont even scratch the surface of mgss story characters and twists
dont trust anybody
that is my best advicegameplay
amazing
youll get use to the layout of the controls very quickly
soon youll be quick reloding and popping around corners like a pro
you can shimmy walls knock on them to distract guards come up behind a guard and choke them until they pass out or just snap their neck
what about ai
it isnt terrible
on easy its a joke
however the guards can see your footprints in the snow and track you
they can also hear your footsteps on certain kind of terrain and when they group up it can be scaryit can make you laugh cry or piss your pants
listen to naysayers if you please but listen to me more
you cannot go wrong with metal gear solid unless you arent an action gamer
it has lots of cinematics old school graphics and some cheesy dialougebut those faults dont overshadow the amazing characters storyline and gameplay
the game is super cheap used nowso go buy it
thank you for reading this alsogot this game to add to my small n collection
game is great and has lots of replay value
the multiplayer mode is megafun especially when you whack your friend in the head with a tire ironroad rash  the continuance of the very popular biker beat em up game of the early s is a very good game
i will admit that the graphics are sub par
theyre not as textured and vibrant as the playstation version even with the expansion pack but this is all about the game playits your basic racing game but you get to beat upthose road hogs and sunday bikers
dont you wish you could do that during rush hour
along the way you get some pretty cool weapons like a chain nunchucks a kendo stick and a pipe wrench
very cool and makes the game that much more funthe game unfortunately goes a little too fast but its still worth it
id pick this one up because if there were any really good combat racing games this was one of the good onesthis game is awsome unfornitly for me i lost it i dont know wear but anywaymultiplayer could provide a hour of good fun with  friendsyou can free play for pratice and even do compatationand there is a cool selection of bikersits also funny like when yu get last place you win like a stick of gumsoapand even caffinefree sodai suggest buying itthis game is addictive and fun as hell to play
thq and jakks pulled out all stops when wrestlmania was released
create and bet wwf championship belts with your friends
tons of game modes including cage match road to wrestlemania createappv royal rumble triple threat hardcore first blood matches lumber jack matches singles tag teametc
createawrestler with custom moves costumes and fighting styles
wwf entrances complete with titantron and theme music thousands of singnature moves taunts and mannerisms
over  of the top wwf superstars and much much moreits a shame thq didnt allow aki to develop there games for the ps as well the ridiculous system yukes developed for quotsmackdownquot makes me feel like im playing mortal kombat instead of wrestling
the aki system provides the best wrestling simulation of all games
the movement is accurate and believable and the reaction the characters have after hurting a particular body part makes for a good wrestling experience
i also particularly like the fact that there is no quothealth barquot on the aki games
this gives the game more of a quotgive and takequot feelps
the review says that i gave it a  but i cant change it for some reason
id actually give it a ugh this game gets boring really fast
not only that but its just plain mediocre
dont even botheri love this game its soooooooo good i play it all the time
alot of the stuff in this is better then no mercy that game is great to i love both of them but all the people and stuff is great i love this game buy iti purchased this game recently through amazon by a rd party seller
it is the original game not the rereleased jewel case xs version
it worked flawlessly on my xp
the game is great if you enjoy puzzles most werent too difficult to solveand a good story line
the graphics are old compared to more recent games but who cares
it was good fun  i will play it again unlike other games
i definately recommend iti am mourning the slow death of the adventure genre
i remember when sierra was pumping out incredible adventure games at a very impressive rateseemingly successful ones too
however sierra is for all practical purposes dead in the adventure worldsee kqmask of eternity
sadly gabriel knightthe best series ever in my opinion quest for glorysecond best series and the rest of their catalogue will probably never get to see the light of day againunless they get worked into a quake installment somehow lolthis lack of productivity in the genre left me searching for older games in the field that i had never played
i found sanitarium online for relatively cheap and ordered iti was not dissapointedit is by far one of the most imaginative storylines ive come across
the gameplay is perhaps too easy for the most part though there are some moderately tough puzzles to figure out
and while the voice acting ranges from horribleunfortunately the lead is the horrible part of it to slightly above averagethe children of chapter two were extremely creepy it makes up for its other deficiencies  with an incredible story  just plain awesome
top  material
gamegreat
voicesnot sooo great
but it doesnt make you not want to play anymore
i have made it to chapter  so far an am stuck on one of the puzzles
grrrr
but it still keeps me a playin  go buy it if you love a good story to unpuzzle
if notgo die thenfinally sanitarium has been rereleased in a jewel case packaging  i could get it after so many years of looking
beware it does not run on xp but it runs very well on me
the story is very intriguing and captivating
puzzles are fairly simple the interface is excellent with graphics and sound effects perfect
this game is a real gem worth every pennythis is probably one of the best adventure games of all time
its one of the few that have made the thirdperson perspective work well
your character wakes up in a sanitarium with a total memory loss
he has bandages on his face and he has no idea what happened or why hes there
you can talk to the inmates which some are humorous others notsomuch
once you escape the sanitarium this is sort of an introductory level you will be out in the surrealistic bizarre world ready to look for answersthere are puzzles to solve however they fit in nicely with the plot and dont just seem thrown in for the sake of making a puzzle adventure
there are  levels in which to get passed each stranger than the one before
these levels are eerie and alot of fun to explore
pick up objects along the way and dont be surprised if you find yourself in a situation where you have to do a bit of fighting to proceed
this game is very unique with a creative plot fantastical worlds and weird characters
the plot is what really kept me playing moreso than even the horror aspects of the game
though many adventure games especially horror ones rely on the basic plot of quotthe main character has amnesiaplay to find out whyquot they are not nearly as well executed as sanitarium is
the main charcater is very likeable and when he gets flashes of memories they are very beautifully done and fascinating to watch
you really do want to find out this guys story why hes here and what happened to him
and instead of everything coming back to him at once you get little hints as you get farther and farther into the game
its almost like a jigsaw puzzle of his mind
there are moments in the plot that are quite touching and the first time i played i even cried a couple of times
though the game has many freaky scenes and horrific characters overall i found the story rather movingthis is sort of a funny way to put it but this game really made me think
instead of the same old hum drum plots this one has a lot of depth and its almost like an exploration of your own sanity as well as the characters
what i liked about sanitarium as opposed to some other institutionbased games is that it didnt get too technical
they sort of made light of the situations rather than cramming disturbing medical references down your throat
this was a game i could really sink my teeth into and one that i wanted to play again and again
there werent alot of long boring cutscenes that make you wonder if youre watching a movie or playing a game
you really feel a part of everything in the game instead of an outsider looking in
call me oldfashioned but i prefer games to be fun and there should be alot of interaction between the player and the game itself
the player should be in controlit shouldnt feel like the game is playing itself
sanitarium passed every test that i could think of and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a sincere and enjoyable adventure gameman this game was mysteriously creepy
so worth the time money and brainwork
makes you wish you could see all the characters faces up closefor more effect
i didnt know if i was going to be really scared or just creeped out
creeped out won
a great story line and wonderful game for adventures
its about a man that has no idea where he is why or even who he ishe just wakes up in a sanitariumenjoy the journey to this quotcrazyquot worldthis is one of the weirdest games that i have played
i had the whole house playing and watching
most entertaining
definitely worth itthe puzzles were pretty easy and the characters are just that
they are charactersmost adventure games do not lure you in to such a haunting story with such detail and innovativeness as this one
others ive played while good are more lighthearted such as the kings quest series
others go for laughs like day of the tentacle or sam and max hit the road
but this game not only skillfully delivers a chilling psychological horror it sprinkles in gimmicks that i have not seen before in this type of gamethe story literally begins in an insane asylum
you wake up your head wrapped in bandages with no knowledge as to your identity nor why you are there
your only clues are the inmates that gibber and bang their head against the wall and sometimes cluck like a chicken
you slowly begin to unravel the strands of a plot but then are catapulted into an entirely new story altogether it seemssanitarium throughout brings you in and out of quotconsciousnessquot traveling to different landscapes  sometimes in different bodies and yet th ewhole thing flows very cohesively
i must admit the ending was a little disappointing and predictable but it did not spoil the funsome of the new features include the directx like feel where you see a building you enter it and the side of the wall disappears to reveal the room you step into beyond
this trick is very ingeneous in packing in all the areas and objects to investigate although on one of the chapters i had a little trouble with it at one pointas with all good adventures it made me want to rush home from work to spend another evening figuring out difficult puzzles wading through the compelling story and guessing just what suprise would come nextdespite my reluctance to discover just where this strange little story would take me nexti just got done with the game and though it is an older game i quite enjoyed it
the game is plot driven and kept my interest
there were plenty of cut scenes that brought the story along and being that i bought it for  in the clearance section i cant complain
one problem though  a technical one  if you have a ati raedeon card youll have a hard time running the game in win xp
i tried and it kept crashing but when i installed the game on another computer with a nivida card it ran perfect with no problems
so if you have an nivida card and like adventure games this is a good onei know i know
there are  reviews for this game
enough right
well even so i couldnt resist
this game is probably one of my favorites right up there with overclocked and syberia
i would say myst to but its a different sort of style
i am a collector of pc games so i hope i know what i am talking aboutif you like creepy games that force you to use your mind and not just for the puzzles then you will adore this gamei love anything to do with the mind especially when the mind goes haywire
so i love them more when they have to do with mental asylems now refered to these days as sanitariumshint hint
everything in this game every little detail has to do with the main characters struggle with memory loss confusion loss of indentity and questions about how reliable his sanity really may bewhen you play this game dont just focus on the graphics displaying seemingly nonsensical surroundings or the voice acting carrying cries over a setting to help set the modd
also focus on the meaning behind the objects around you behind the cries and behind the forms maxmain character takes during gameplay because they all have a deep meaning for the characterthe controls take a little getting used to but after awhile they become second nature and the game is so worth getting used to the controls
this is a definite worth your money game
the graphics arent amazing but nor are they bad
hope you get to enjoy this gamewhat a weird game this is
it had been gathering dust in my closet for at least a year untill i sort of felt in the mood for playing it
this was because the content seemed a bit bloody but most of all because the controls seemed annoying
you have to move your character by holding the right mousebutton all the time and that doesnt relieve you of any slumbering rsibut what a challenging and hauntingly beautiful game this turned out to be
the puzzles are very well integrated into the story but it is foremost the story itself that earns the five stars
you have to wander through several worlds that are so very very weird they will stretch your imagination to the limit
the plot unfolds itself nicely and will keep surprising yousome of the worlds or dreams or visions or whatever took getting used to but how rewarding it all was
the story will keep you awake and follow you in months to come after youve finished sanitariumon the graphics side well they are a bit outdated but they are still eyecandy
an amazing colourpalette is used it just looks great
the cutscenes are black and white just in keep with the atmosphere of the gameand theres the humour
this game had me laughing out loud many times quite a feat sonsidering the gory content of the game
although gory well its not for the fainthearted
imagine having to push a corpse in an oven to be able to solve a puzzle but is is always done with witsanitarium is a masterpiece both in concept and in content
it ranks right up there with my other alltime favourits like myst riven journeyman project  and beyond atlantisi got this cause a friend of mine wanted it i never played it or anything
he stated it worked fine and he liked it and it was as fun as he remembered however that it was also really difficult which he didnt remember
so if you remember this game you might like it
i cant say for sure but he would have probably rated this  starsi have had this game since it came out and i absolutely love it
i am a gamer and this is still the first game i install on ever pc i get
i have beat this game about  times and still love it
it is easy to play scary and just all around fun
this is one of my favorite games and i would say one of the top scariest games of all time
although playing it when it first came out with it having great graphics for the time totally made it more scary then now with games with far better graphics
but still a game to be played
i would suggest this game to hardcore gamers and casual gamers alikeif you have little children who enjoy the rugrats believe me theyll love this game
my kids are ages yrs to yrs old and this game has provided hours and hours of fun
i never heard my  kids laughing and cheering each other on so much until i purchased this game for themwe have all played civ  because this is a winner of all the games so far
the gold edition goes step beyond
principally it hasnt changed but it has extras and a lot of them
i must mention a lot of different  scenarios possibilities to make your own scenarios yes not just maps
and a huge manual which describes virtually everything
we civ   fanswill again sit for hours in front of our gray boxes with red eyes and  if anyone will look at us will shortly realize that we are completely  insane
if i may phrase one famous cartoon characterwhat will we do  tomorrow night
the same thing we do every night try to take over the  worldthe civilization  gold does what most other gold eiditions do
takes the game and makes a few changes and this one gives to a nice instrution booklet
in civilization you start with simple settlers and build a city
you must build  units to protect those cities and city advangements to keep  your people happy
later in the game you meet other civilizations and can  either become allies and trade technologies or enimies and try and take  over your oppents teritory and cities
this is a game that i would  recommend for everybodythis review applies to the pc version
lets be clear up front about one thing this is an old game
by pc standards its geriatric
its not going to show off the powers of your new acme d eye bleeder card or wow you with the way it exploits the quadrophonic features of your widget ear puncturer when the quotcivquot license fragmented into quottest of timequot and quotcall to powerquot these both made at least some improvements on the graphics and sound particularly ctp
so why do people like me keep civ ii on their hard drive after so many years
its the game babyits a system of rules which is simple elegant and addictive
it has a somewhat intuitiveand relatively largetechnology tree
it feels right
it mostly works right
some of the ai is pathetic but ive yet to find a game where that isnt the case
its easy to learn but constantly challengingand the rules are balanced
both ctp and tot made changes to the rules that either made things murkier or threw the game way out of balancedid i mention that this is a long game
even a short civ game is long
unbalanced rules in civ mean that the last  hours you spent building your civilization went to waste because your opponent developed an uberunit
its no wonder some people were ready to burn their copies of ctp or totciv ii doesnt have that
if your civilization gets off the ground at all youre going to be aware of most of the potential threats
you can throw it all away with carelessness but not because the game put you in an impossible spot
you can lose ground due to a surprise but you can regroup and counterand you can play it so many ways
you can be the conqueror the scientist the diplomat et ceterain some ways its a fragile game given how easily attempts to alter the rules have thrashed it
it remains to be seen if even sid meier himself can improve on this formula with the upcoming civilization iiinow you can get the regular or you can get the gold
the gold adds improved multiplayer support and all the scenarios
for myself i dont much care for the scenarios
and as the game progresses each turn takes increasing amounts of time maybe not ideal for multiplayer
some people dig it though
so you may want to save a buck or two and get the vanillabut you cant really go wrong with this game
if you like computer strategy games at all this is a musthavethis second sid meyers game is absolutely one of the best computer games that has ever been made
i at first was completely dumbfounded by the whole nature of the game but gradually learned how it was done and now i absolutely love this gameyou start in the year  bc
as a single settler and found your capital city and then as you start building warriors at the beginning of the game your civilization is primitive and tribal explore the continent and found new cities to expand your civilizations bordersas the game goes on settlers military units will inevidently encounter individuals from other civilizations
be very careful though because you may have no idea of the other civilizations are friendly neutral or hostile so be prepared for anything
after that there are many options for forging alliances between civilizations and playing the game by dove politics or world domination and conquering the entire planet
i once in fact did just that conquer the entire planet on this gamethis game comes with  wonder of the world some of which arent really all that much to write home about except to raise your city cities to the top  list but others however will benifit your civilization for the rest of the game
three architectural styles also are in this game as well
my favorite style is the old fashioned medievel castlespreindustrialization styles especially when playing the vikings english spanish or the germans
i do love though the big cities by the end and are amazing to look atthe graphics even if a bit crude by todays standards are really amazing even by  standards
the music is mostly hohum in my opinion but at least you can run the game without the cdrom which is a big plus if you want to listen to a music cd while playing
the game runs quite well on my computer even if the computer is of an older model and ive never experienced any bugs while playingwatch your civilization evolve from a onevillage tribe to a gargantuan military empire over the years and have a swell time
for all we know it would be useful if there was a magic trick that could transfigure one into a pocketwatch because once you start playing you just might end up losing track of time and will be playing for hours on endsid meyers truly created a timeless game for all ages
a pity the third installment came nowhere close to thisive used both unreal tournament and quake  arena extensively and unreal tournament definitely comes out on top
in my experience unreal tournament gets much higher framerates yet has far more beautiful graphics than quake  arena could ever hope to achieve even on the highest settings ive tried
with an extensive array of rd party addons available online  unreal tournaments gameplay is endlessif you are comparing this to quake  then take note that the level design in ut is much better and this keeps the game very interesting
q levels seem cramped in comparison
this game totally surprised me at how addictive  it isunreal tournament is one great game
as far as first person shooters are concerned on the mac ut is the champion
great graphics great gameplay this game has it all
i originally used this on my imac mhz with a gamewizard voodoo card installed and it ran fantastic
now im on the same imac but with a mhz processor and averaging  frames per second on the game
there is no real storyline here but this isnt the type of game that requires one
this is all about pure action
the levels that come bundled in with unreal tournament are great but once you start to add on rd party levels from the internet the game really takes flight
i have found some incredibly detailed levels that will keep you engrossed for hours on end
if you want a fun game that can even be played across the internet then unreal tournament is the game for youunreal tournament is a game where you blow guts up
you pick from lots of different species and skins
there is different cool kinds of gameplay in it
there is tournament deathmatch tournament team deathmatch domination assision capture the flag or last man standing all have like at least  different maps to play
tournament deathmatch tournament team deathmatch and last man standing is all the same maps
tournament deathmatchbasically blow anyone up that is standing
tournament team deathmatchyou play  teams green blue red and gold blow up the other team
dominationyou have to teams red and blue and you try to get  different places and if you get  plus what ever you put deaths on you win
asission two teams one defending a base or a object one trying to destory it
if you can do it then the other team gets the same time as you and face off
capter the flag two teams red and blue and trying to get the other teams flag but its hard because its way back in the other base try to survive almost imposible
so many points of getting the flag to your base and you win
last man standingyou get every weapon but two and try to kill each other you get a certain number of lives that you choose
you also get  liveall that plus  different weaponschainsawyou only get this if you check chainsaw melee and you can rip other peoples head offtranslocateryou need to check translocater to get this you basically teleport and if you teleport really close to someone you can kill them by telefraggin themimpact hammerno ammo you always have this if you go by someone with this you can shoot guts everywhereenforcerlike a hand gun you start out with this gun and  ammobiosluge gunyou take a gun and use toxic sluge to kill people warning it can kill you tooasmd shock rifleyou use a eletrick shock rifle to kill peoplepulse gunlike asmd shock rifle but more shooting more ammo and its green not blue shootingrippera gun take shoots razor blades outminiguna gun that is very weak but shoots out like  bullets in  secondsflak cannonlots of little or one big yellow shock ball hits you does huge damagerocket lonchershot out lots of rocket with this rocket lonchersniper rifleget a closer view on this
shoot the head it pops outredeemera superrocket loncher shoots out  mini nuclear bombnow how could you resist this plus you can go online and play make or download maps skins and get version grapicslooking animation great job on this one
fun what cant be fun about this game
gameplaymovieplay it lasts a long time
sound i dont like the music that much
overall you need to get this game
 which is awesome on my scale and a big  stars at amazoncomhave you heard enough about which one is better quake iii or ut
i know i have
so what do you get out of the box when you invest in ut
its a winner i tell you that right away
lets see   cool weapons each  with two attack modes to keep it all a tad more interesting than just point  and shoot
you may actually end up developing something resembling a  personal style with these
especially interesting is the translocator  which in addition to being a nice transportation device allows you to beam  yourself right into your opponents carcassesntildeeffectively ripping them  asunder of course
clean me up scottyif you arent all that crazy  about online games ut does live up to its claim of being a killer  singleplayer experience the bots boring as they look except for the  very goth necris i think will keep you entertained and on your toes
the  ai is purty adroit true bots dont play like human players but these  digital playpals get close
they use all weapons and gadgets very  efficiently go everywhere you go no cozy endless sniping here and i  swear that during one capturetheflag game i was ambushed by one waiting  right outside my home base as i rushed after the enemy flag bearer who had  cleverly activated his personal shield specifically for this maneuver
dohif you do get bored you can still tweak just about every aspect  of the game from individual bot intelligence behavior and weapons  preferences to special mutators for the matches want sniper rifles only
no problem
ut boasts  maps a lot of which are simply breathtakingntildeill  never forget the first time i was standing on the dizzying height of a  space station tower with jupiter filling the sky and its moons wheeling  around above my head
you may even catch the occasional shooting star no  reallyntildejust before that nasty sniper feels that youve been standing in one  place long enough
imagine fighting on board a spaceship zipping through  hyperspace  or a galleon on moonlit seas  or in an egyptian tomb   whoa dudeut adds two new game concepts to the traditional menu in  domination you and your team the bots by the way are very responsive  during team play too need to hold a number of designated control points  as long as possible in order to win and in assault you actually have a  number ofntildenaturally destructiventildemission objectives to fulfil  eg
storm  the facility take out gizmo a to get to gizmo b and blow that up too  after which the tables turn and your team takes the defending sideoh  and one thing and my only quake iii  ut comparison the bots in ut talk  their acknowledgements comments and taunts and theyre pretty  nastyntildequite unlike the witty and urbane remarks of the quake bots you see  printed on the screen
you might get provoked into anger and violence  burning to shove their smart  quips back down their throats
you dont mind  that do youbut you may want to put on the headphones while your kids  are around  or your parentsanother multiplayer fps ut offers modes ranging from ffa blast fests to team based combat missions
this game has something for everyone including tutorial levels for those just starting out
excellent graphics and topnotch production value roundout this gem but it is definitley not for the under  group
this game has a whopping  levels and  ways to playdeathmatchmy personal favoriteassaultdominationand capturetheflagit is backed by aweb site that hosts a bevy of online tournaments hence the nameduh
and offers patchestipsand chat with other gamersif you havent played it yet i sugggest you try it and kiss that thing you used to have called a social life goodbyei am apalled at some of the negative reviews on this game
it combines spectacular graphicsit was built on the unreal engine so what else would you expect
and a totally engrossing storyline
if you have a good top end graphics card that supports direct d then you are in for a spectacular journey in this game
the direct d mode of this game is absolutely breathtaking  especially in certain levels
i have experienced no sluggishness at all with my riva tnt  pro video carda top end video card that is excellent
however those who choose to use the low end cards like the entire voodoo seriesthe yugos of computer video cards will not enjoy this or any other game because of all the sluggishness those cards produce frequently
i fully recommend this game to anyone who like me has waited for a a perfect blend of role playing and fps games
the playabilty of this game is wonderful and it is a fun challenging game as well
enjoyi always wanted to give this game a try but never did purchase the game
it always had very good reviews and perked my interest as a wot fan
gamespy recently put it in their top  underrated games it was in the top  so i tried to hunt down a copy
atari still sells it directly from their sitethis is an awesome fps game one of the best ive played and ive played them all
great story and great graphics given the games age
better game then half life in my opiniongame play is awesome and very strategic
you need to conserve your resources and use them wisely and you are given many options for getting through the levels
the level design is another awesome aspect of the game the levels are extemely well designed and beautifuli was surprised how good the ai was
there are quirks and expolitable situations but i dont remember playing a game recently that had ai as good as wot
the enemies are very agressivefor the price you can get the game for from atari its a steali was almost surprised to see the few negative reviews here but none of them really give an indepth review of the game
of course its expected that some wot fans would be disappointed but as a fan myself i feel legend did the right thing
they did not try to adapt the existing books to the game they merely used the world jordan created and did a great job of itthis is an fps through and through
its not an rp game though it does a great job in story telling
piece of advice keep cd in the drive while playing the game or you will miss the movies that explain much of the plot and add a lot of atmosphere
i noticed a few reviewers seemed to miss the thread of the story and most likely its because they missed the movies
you need to have quicktime installed to see the movies provided on the games cd though its an old version
movies ran fine with qt on my machine
you can also run a setup from cd and install the music and movies to your hard drive
yes this means you can run the game without having the cd in the drive this feature really dates the game
what can i say i thoroughly enjoyed this game and im kicking myself for not having playing it in 
on a p ghz ati radeon  pro on winxp the game runs perfectly
the version available from atari does not need any patching theyre already appliedit is a great computer game and this commander pack is the elite version of total annihilation
the strategy guide included was super cool and i read it often
if you want the beginning of rts games this is itthis game was originally released  years ago and is still going strong
it has two official and several player generated expansions as well as loads of additional units and buildingsone thing that really seperates this game from other rts games is the commander
in this game there are several units that can create buildings and all of these can create many buildings that the commander cannot
but the commander is the most important unit in the game
because like the king in chess if you lose your commander you lose the game
but dont expect a chess game
this game has everything from light laser towers and small crawling bombs to stealth fighters and nuclear warheadsyou can play either of two sides
each side has its advantages and disadvantages
but most of the units have a comparable enemy counterpart
there are dozens of missions per side in the original game alone plus many skirmish maps
when you add in the two expansions that come in the commander pack you add loads of campaign missions and several more skirmish maps
the replay value is extremely high just from these featuresand then there is the still massive online community
test your skill against many awesome players
make friends and download user created maps units and even expansionsall in all if you like real time strategy games you cant miss with this onebattle tactics the second expansion pack of the game not a separate version is a missions expansion pack featuring a lot of standalone separate missions in other words not part of a larger story
the missions are split into three if i remember correctly categories based on approximate time needed to complete them
not all the missions are shorti played total annihilation and its expansion packs for approximately  years
one of my favorite games of all time
a classic that any fan of rts games will enjoythere is still an active community online and many many usermade mods and extra unitsive owned a copy of the original ta
almost since its release in late  at first glance its nothing special but then again thats what i said when i first got a copy for christmas in  ive been playing solidy ever since and loving every minute of it
sadly cavedog interactive the company that made ta
went under at the turn of the milennium
thus finding a copy of the game is increasingly difficult
if anyone can get their hands on a copy then i say go for the gusto and look for all the extras that cavedog and the boneyards left scattered around online
theres a downloadable map mission and unit editor
ive seen countless map packs and unit packs online
theres no end to the fun with this game
the campaign mode and storyline is solid
i cant stop with the praise for this game
grab a copy and start playinga friend of my bought a game at a store and returned it because his computer couldnt handle the requirements
so he returned it but couldnt get money back so he got this game
after having for a month he finally started to play it and that was it
in the end another friend and myself started getting together three times a week playing this game for over  years straight against each other
i have probably played over  battles
and you can download free units and maps over the internet
very cool
the game is very fast paced with many buildings units and other weapons
i still play this game to this day as do my friends
i recommend this game to everyone and i hope that they make the sequelsince i first bought this game ive gone through three computers  a pii a piii and a p
now im still playing this classic on my dualcore and its just as fun as everi dont care if the graphics dont wow me or if the score is old and familiar like the marx brothers duck soup or if the sound effects were designed for a soundblaster in  the game is funthis is a rare rts that can accomodate any generals strategy
you can focus on air power artillery tank rushes infantry rushes naval bombardment airdrops you name it you can do itcc generals has a strategy center that allows you to hold the line or bombard or search and destroy
but total annihilation does it better and without spending  credits building a strategy centerseriously this game is great if you just want to kill half an hour or if you need an allnight gaming sessionawesome scary nitty gritty isolation desperation some musics very beautiful somes very uglyin a good way uhh scary fun
play in a dark room at night alone or with your petwow i was fourteen when i played this  sure the ps was out for three years already and there were other scary games out at that time but i was a little underprivilaged with my game systems
i had a ps and there were a slew of really good ps games out that i could afford
so i started my collection
i had played syphon filter once so i thought i could handle everything
i went to a yard sale and saw this game sitting on a table for ten dollars
i thought sure i can handle this
the guy said its really scary are you sure
he looked at my mother then to me
i looked at my mother then to the guy and confidently said i can handle it
ive watched hellraiser nightmare on elm street ect i was full of my teenage self
well we got home and i put this in my ps
from the very instant i removed the cd and saw in the case to menacing eyes glaring at me i knew something was up
i put in the game saw the warning thought oh it may contain graphic scenes
big deal
its like melted lego block graphics
i can handle it
the game starts with your character waking from a crash in a foggy town
you walk around until you see the shadow of your daughter in the distance
you chace her through the fog and snow but cant seem to catch up
she heads into an alley way
you go down
theres a fence that says beware of dog
i was thinking well i need to find a weapon
i look in my inventory and all i have is a lighter
i cannot attack and i cannot do anything with the lighter okay lets go inside
maybe there will be a gun thereno
only blood lots and lots of blood okay lets do this
i say as i press forward
the camera pans overhead as i proceed down the darkening allyway
i go farther see more blood bodies a lone wheelchair darkness i get to use my lighter now to give off faint light deeper deeper more fences and blood no point in turning back the music is insinuating that maybe i am making a bad decision but its too late now and then i see it and the end of the long alley way a twisted mauled bodies hangs crucified and motionless
okay thats bad maybe i can i turn my character around and from the inky darkness looms small childlike shapes
they come at me with knives and squeal in some sort of backwards laugh they stab me in the knees and i cannot attack
i look for weapons i click on everything i run back dead end they crowd around me three or four or five or infinity i dont know im panicked and screaming at the screen why the hell
what the hell
when thuwhat thuthrow me a bone
then i die
i turn of my console and put this at the bottom of my stack
this game made me its bitch
for a year i did not tackle it
then my mother urged me to play it she is a horror movie fan and wanted to see the outcome but was too much of a wuss to play it herself so i did died again and then waited i was supposed to die at the beginning
way to psyche me out gamethe game is fun engaging and frustrating
the puzzles are challenging without being inpossible
the graphics arent pretty but they set the tone for the game perfectlyyou have a kid that loves horror games and movies give them this
sure they may complain about the graphics but after a little while they will not be able to tell the difference
in a few moments the game will be playing them getting into their head and messing with them as they try to dig deeper into the game
yeah its that kind of game
you do not play this game it plays youthere are many excellent survival horror games on the market but there are very few games as disturbing as silent hill
whilst playing there are moments when you will be completely freaked out by the bizarre and nightmarish things that are happening to your character harry mason as the game charts his search for his missing daughter lost after a car accident in the deserted town of silent hill
dont expect an easy time in this game the town is filled with horrific beasts and apparitions which will chase and attack you
as in most games of this nature youre aim is to explore the eerie town and delve deeper into its secrets by solving puzzles usually morbid or goulish in nature
and collect ammunition and weapons to help you survive the onslaught
but even during the quiet moments the sense of dread is so realistic that you will be completely drawn in to the game
the story is bizarre to say the least and often very distressing
even the quotbest endingquot to the game there are several is downbeat and elegiac
it might sound like i am exaggerating about things here but i can clearly remember several sections of the game when there was nothing to do but panic a feeling that no other game has since produced
some events in the game are completely surreal with strange noises and phantom figures appearing with no explanation the result being that playing silent hill is like living inside someones nightmare
this game should be experienced by everyone brave enough to take the challengesilent hill
what can you say
i remember being so excited to get this back in february of  the commercials on tv looked really good and i loved the first  resident evil games that were out at the timethis game is not a resident evil clone
there is no item management
it reminds me more of clock tower than resident evil
the environments look excellent with the fog and it only ups the tension
when it changes to night or dark the game just gets betterthe so called clunky action is perfect
harry is not a stars
member or trained with a gun so why would he be a perfect shot
we normal people certainly wouldntits obvious the creators love the horror genreall the streets are named after famous horror and science fiction authors there are movies references psycho is the only one ill give youthe hotelthe final staircaseoh come on go watch a classic movie people
highly recommend this as only resident evil  is a better representation of the survival horror genre when it was at its peak in the late sthis game is in a genre of its own as far as im concerned
whilst it may be in the same vein of some other actionhorror titles it is by far superior in every aspect imaginable
this game provokes a constant atmosphere of brooding terror
this game is dark suspenseful and twisted
play this game alone with the blinds closed with the tv volume cranked and within minutes youll be scolding the child in you that is getting up to turn the lights back on
im not kidding this game will scare you
this is an actionhorror game with plenty of action and enough horror for two games with some left over
puzzles that will have you scratching your chin and nightmares made flesh that will have you buying batteries for your nightlight
this game takes you to the fogclad streets of an ominously deserted suburbia through the twisted paralell worlds of a town gone straight to hell
here lies an oppurtunity nightmarish as it is profound for you to explore the depths of darkness and maybe however unlikely survive
if youre not trembling too badly already and you think youre up for a test of both wits and guts i strongly suggest you click add to cartthe survival horror genre has long been one of my favorites and is quite honestly why i bought a playstation in the first place
i saw an ad for squaresofts parasite eve in rolling stone a few years ago and ran right out and bought me a unit along with xenogears and resident evilive played a lot of playstation games since then but none has matched the level of intensity and sheer horror of silent hill
this game earned the five star rating that i gave it
i only hope this review will convey just how good it isthe game opens with a stunning although somewhat confusing intro of a man and his daughter driving along a mountain road in an suv at night
the suv gets passed by a policewoman on a motorcycle
a few curves later he sees the motorcycle overturned on the side of the road
looking up he sees a girl standing in the middle of the road
swerving to miss her the suv goes careening into the ditch and rolls over
the intro is intermingled with other cutscenes from the game
these make no sense when you first see them but i found myself watching the intro again and again as i went through the gamesome time later daylight now he awakens and notices that his daughter is missing
he staggers from the truck and into a nearby city  silent hillthe object of the game is to track down your daughter
you hunt around silent hill looking for your daughter
the city is almost completely deserted its snowing and theres a fog that prevents you from seeing more than a few yards in front of you
if thats not bad enough the city is full of rabid dogs and flying things that look like pteridactyls or really big batsnot only that but you keep sliding between the real silent hill and an entirely too eerie pitch black nightmare version of silent hill
all you can see is what your flashlight shows you and let me just say that when little demon children come after you out of the dark youll be calling for your mama
these little demon kids they travel in pairs  one grabs you around the legs so you cant move and the other comes up and starts stabbing the poor nurse and a deranged old woman you meet in the story are probably the most memorable characters and creatures ive seen in a gamethe game is played in the third person ala lara croft and like tomb raider is a straight up adventure game
the controls were easy to learn and pretty straightforwardthe music is tremendous
its one of the few games i know that has its own soundtrack cd available
the music used for the intro sets the mood of the game perfectlyof course all games have their downsides
this one doesnt have much to pick on but there are a few little things
first the graphics arent that great
the fogs there for a reason  they cant render d objects more than a few yards away from youalso some of the cutscenes from the introduction arent in the game anywhere and make no sense on their own
this is kind of annoying  these scenes are really bizarre and it would be nice to know what they meant
maybe i missed some parts of the gamefinally like many adventure games silent hill was quite linear
a lot of the game was finding a key to open a door so that you could kill some stuff find another key open the next door etcbut all in all if youre at all a fan of resident evil style games this ones for you
a warning that the game was given a mature rating by the esrb and it is deserved
while the game has no swearing that i can remember or nudity the mood is very very dark and intensethink twice about playing this game if you live alone or if your pacemaker doesnt have fresh batteriesforget about the repetitive resident evil series this is the only horror game you need to play
the story one of the most complex out there with clock tower s as a close rival features an ordinary citizen in search of his daughter in a game whose atmosphere is in many ways similar to that of quotjacobs ladderquot with many psychological terror overtonesone of the most underrated games in the psx due its primitive graphic display making it even creepier and game play let us pray silent hill  for the ps will be more of the same
only better and creepier and of course remain as underrated as possible that way the game does not become as crude as the re serieswhile quotresident evilquot was widely popular as a survival horror series konami decided to take advantage of this genre and along came quotsilent hillquot  you played the role of harry mason who was going to take a vacation in the remote town of silent hill with his adopted daughter cheryl whom he found on the side of the road and no one had knowledge of her
once entering the town he loses cheryl and yearns to find her only to find the town is covered in fog and strange things are afoot
an extremely enthralling and creepy game read on if you darethe goodthe storyline has more plot twists than a pretzel
youll get lost in it several times and some of it doesnt really make sense but it keeps you hooked
hooked as if your sensitive areas were going to explode if you stopped playing
this game is dated by today because of the second and third silent hills but i still find this game to be creepy today
to tell you the truth while i hate comparing games i do find this game to be scarier than quotresident evilquot  while both game series are fun this one has that series beaten in the quotcreepyquot department evil nurses and demon children will attack you when you least expect it even with your radio blaring out static
in fact youll hear crazy sounds while youre playing it and youll be scared even when your radio is not on which by the way the radio tells you if enemies are nearby
if its not blaring out static no monsters are near you
the environments especially in the nightmare world like the frikken hospital are downright scary and provide an atmosphere thats incredibly attacking your senses
there are three endings and one alternate quotfunnyquot ending involving aliens which makes the game more interesting
the game is reasonably hard with its downright mindboggling puzzles and religious symbolism but with a strategy guide or a friend who knows what heshe is doing this game actually isnt all that difficult
what makes it difficult is whether or not you can sit through this terrifying game all the way through it
my favorite scary bit funny in a freaky way when youre in the school you find a locker with something inside budging it
you open it and a cat runs out
the cat runs out the door and you hear a crunch sound as if it was eaten
when you enter the nightmare school you find that same locker only with nothing in it except a pool of blood
konami was on drugs when they made this gamethe badnothing bad i can think of
i was going to order you to consult your physician before playing this game like i normally do but then again you might consult a psychiatrist once you start playing because its just that creepyoverallif you want a game thatll scare the piss out of you this is the game for you
with scary environments and monsters creepy characters and a storyline that will mess with your brain to no avail this game hooks your attention like no other game can
youll want to beat this game and then breathe a sigh of relief once its over then you got two more games which are ten times scarier than this one
a musthave for playstation fans
in fact one of the reasons to own a playstation periodit is quite amusing to see how many people bad mouth this game and how many people were actually spooked by this horrific game
honestly i was quite horrified by this game silent hill
i did not purchase it when it first came out but i saw the ad for it on the back of my resident evil manual and thought i would check this game out
boy was i in for a surprisethere are not too many things that really scare me when it comes to video games but this is a exception
the resident evil series scared me at many points but silent hill just ooozes creepiness
this game disturbed me enough that i avoided playing it till i felt more comfortable
i personally think it is that scarythe story of silent hill is based around you playing harry who is looking for his daughter cheryl who is lost in the town of silent hill
however what you dont know is that silent hill is slowly transforming into hell itself and time is running out for you to find your daughter
and another thing is that your daughter is tied into silent hills demise into a hellish nightmare
one thing about this game is that you might not fully pick up on the storyline of silent hill the first time thru
silent hill has a storyline that is very complex and huge and you can find some websites that can fully explain the story behind what is going on in silent hill that you will not pick up on in the first run thru the gamethe gameplay has been bad mouthed by many people as very unreponsive and the camera pans are truly hated but i found no real problems as i played it
a good thing about this game is that you go up against demons and hellish creatures asa normal human being
you are not a cop fbi agent or some special ops soldier
you are harry mason a writer caught in this mess
you make a lot of noise when you walk you get tired when you run you dont shoot very well and you dont know what the heck is going on in silent hill
this truly brings the realism to the gameif you are tired of the resident evil games and wish to play a story that will plunge you into a hellish nightmare buy this game
this game is truly underrated in that it did not get the spotlight it deserved
and study up on the story behind silent hill it is very interesting and this is a game i will add to my permanent collectionwhat a perfect day to review a dreary scary classic video game
this is one of those rainy cold and windy april days
we have them every year
after being teased with exceptionally warm weather a couple days ago days like today make you realize how lucky you are to experience warmer than normal temperatures
i could sit here and talk about the weather all day and i probably will after this review is finished but its time to review a game that was groundbreaking at the time of its release
a game that was very disturbing then and just as disturbing todayfor those of you older gamers whove been playing games way before silent hill was released i bet youve played games that had their share of creepy moments a certain memorable level in a video game that youve always felt uncomfortable exploring because you just didnt think youd be able to calm your nerves when you arrive to that area of the game
come on now you can tell me its just a video game but when everyone leaves your bedroom and its just you in front of your tv screen playing a video game late at night youre bound to come across something in some game that will frighten you
now imagine if an entire game featured total nonstop adrenalinepumping fear
a game that strikes fear inside of you like no other
were talking about a game that forces you to think about death and really frightens that little part inside of your head that you thought had been permanently laid to rest once you entered your teenage years
this game brings back every childhood fear and then adds some morethis is truly a game for the stronggutted
its true that the level of fear in this game is so high that you will constantly be looking over your shoulder whenever you begin to feel frightened you will be looking down the hallway of your home and looking out the window to make sure nothing is there
you want to make sure all those noises you are hearing are coming from the game and not under your bed or somewhere else in your home
i never thought it was possible to create fear in such a way and pull it off successfully in a video game but thats what silent hill is all about
believe it or not i really think this game is scarier than any movie ive ever watched and that includes classics like the exorcist and the ring
thats because in the world of video games you can picture yourself as the main character harry and picture what it must be like for him to visit a town like silent hill and the amount of fear that must be going through both you and harry
you see because you the gamer are controlling harry its not just harry going through the dreaded town of silent hill by himself its you and harry
you two have to stick together and make it out alive
both of you have to put those scary feelings aside and progress through the gametheres a little something that makes this game even scarier the sound of hearing an enemy coming closer to you but not being able to find it
many times it will be too late and the enemy will have found you first and youll take an unexpected blow
thats not to say the game is a frustrating experience with enemies coming out of nowhere cheapshotting you but occasionally it will happen and this makes the game a lot of fun
it makes the atmosphere so real and intense you can almost taste it
if you like entering the world of survival horror and thriller movies this is the game for youjust picture this youre walking down a street in an empty town
its snowing and its quiet all around you
suddenly you hear wings flapping far off in the distance
you stop dead in your tracks
the sound becomes louder and louder as something gets closer and closer to you
you quickly check all around you to try and see if you can find where that sound is coming from but you dont see anything
a scream is heard from far away a demonlike scream and then another louder scream soon follows
before you know it you see giant flapping wings right above you attacking your head
your instinct is to defend yourself but when you turn and aim the gun the enemy is nowhere to be seen
you continue to hear flapping sounds and prepare yourself for another round with the beast
but the sounds get softer and softer until they disappear
you ask yourself is it gone is it over
while continuing to hold your gun in the air
sometimes during these moments the enemy will be gone other times it will trick you into thinking its gone but then come back for another fight
and this is just in the daytime part of the game
imagine how much harder and more frightening this battle becomes when the sky suddenly turns dark and the enemies want to come out and play
thats what makes the game so great you just dont know what to expector how about when you arrive to the hospital
you enter a hospital and no one is around
once again everything is quiet
its not so scary but its definitely eerie and it makes you cautious
you think about what might be ahead of you
you dont want to explore this hospital but you have to if you want to finish the game
you look outside the hospital window to see snow still falling to the ground just as it was before you entered the hospital
not so scary but maybe i would feel better if i could find someone
this hospital is just a little too empty for meyou explore all the rooms find some clues and arrive to an elevator
you click to go to the third floor but the door is locked so you have to go back
you try the second floor and once again you cant go through the door so you have to go back to the elevator
you think to yourself okay this is just strange
back inside the elevator for some unexplainable reason a th floor suddenly becomes an option so you go there
you ask yourself was that th floor always there
this time when you come out of the elevator the door isnt locked and youre allowed to enter the floor
once you enter that floor you wish that calm snowy daytime scenery from a few moments ago was still around because now youre in a dark haunted hospital surrounded by nurses with knives constantly slashing at you floors that have been turned into gates and dreary walls soaked in blood all over every room in the hospital and the music that plays here is simply amazing the way it makes you think about blood just waiting to ooze from all over the place
it scares you so much you just want to throw up and theres no avoiding it you cant turn back now
its a total nightmarei know the playstations old graphics look dated by todays standards and many people have a problem with them but this game is an exception because the grainy graphics really add more fear and excitement to the game
it makes it so no matter where you go youre surrounded by this world of dreariness
the level of fear doesnt let up at all throughout the entire game you are forced to either get used to it or else turn off the game if you cant handle it
i honestly believe theres nothing to be ashamed of if you cant handle it
many people cant watch horror movies because after the movie is over and they turn the television off theyre afraid of the silence
every little sound they hear after the movie is over will make them jump and yell what was that
silent hill features a variety of fears you have the boogeyman in the closetsleeping with the light on type of fear and the other major and more dangerous please dont make me think about death because i dont know what happens when i die type of fear
its important to realize no matter how frightened you may be in the end youre only playing a video game
i dont want anyone to go crazy letting the amount of fear in silent hill get the best of them and walk around all day lightheaded and nervous
its just a game and you may think im exaggerating but im honestly not its very well possible silent hill could bother you days after you play itbut you have to give a lot of credit to all the people that brought this game to the playstation they set out to make the ultimate psychological horror experience and they succeeded
it was groundbreaking at the time because no other game company at the time dared to attempt to turn up the amount of horror that this game offered
it was revolutionary in the world of video games
with all due respect to capcom and the resident evil series those games are fantastic and a lot of fun but silent hill made the amount of fear so high that many gamers are afraid to not only play it but even think about iti think the one thing that makes the experience so overwhelming is the music
in the final level of the game you will come across some atmospheric parts that sound exactly like an evil wind blowing right by you and i mean you not harry mason
thats an incredible sound right there
im not someone who usually exaggerates but the creators of this game may have surprised themselves with this constant flow of creepinesssilent hill also offers plenty of other things
a good but confusing story plenty of enemies to shoot with your three guns or smash with your hammers and swords and fantastic attention to detail in every area of the game
truly deserving of  starsrating aperhaps it was with resident evil that horror games began to rear their ugly head pun intended but it was here that psychological tension and true horror was established on the playstation as few can argue the tension and suspense this game and all of the games in the series exhibit in terms of just staying with you long after youve put down the controller and have crawled into bed for what you might have hoped to be a nice night of sleep
although part two trounces this game in nearly every category this game still stands the test of time as one of the defining games on playstation  as where re reinvented horror silent hill turned it on its head and bludgeoned it with a rusty screwdriver making you wonder where in the hell the creators for this game got their ideas in the first place
basically the story in a nutshell revolves around harry mason as he drives by the town of silent hill late one night with his daughter cheryl
upon seeing a motorcycle cop pass him it is only moments later where he once again sees her bike again but turned over on the side of the road
upon looking back up a girl is standing in the middle of the road harry swerves to avoid hitting her and the next time he awakens he finds cheryl gone his jeep destroyed and he is in a town encircled with mist and filled with dead ends that lead to nowhere in particular
picking up mellee objects and guns along the way harry fights through hordes of demons or are they really demons
to find his daughter and try to save her from the hellish town of silent hill
from a church to a school and all the way to a hospital and a mall few places are left unturned in harrys search for his missing daughter as the mangled pieces of ths puzzle fall into place the storyline becomes more and more disjointed until the bizarre final battle in nowhere
a note to those that might play through the game and be caught off guard by the seemingly strange storyline that never seems to come together completely play silent hill  to get the true conclusion of this games storyline or simply head on over to gamefaqscom and check out any of the storyline weavers over there they are written impeccably well and help to bridge the gap where you might be left wondering exactly what the hell is going on
although the games battle system is a bit awkward silent hill is more about atmosphere and storyline which it exhibits in spades all throughout the whole series once again part  being the pinnacle
if you enjoy this game check out jacobs ladder an excellent and disturbing movie that hugely inspired this game and the series in general this will also help you get a feel for the whole disjointed reality nightmare scenarios present thorughout the whole series
all i can say to conclude this article is wait til these guys make a game on the upcoming generation of systems as truly these crators are geniuses that have mastered the craft of game making to an art form and their works give you the same kind of horror and awe as looking at francis bacon painting as we wonder just what the hell is beyond the abyss awaiting us in the inner sanctums of our own dilapidated imagination and dreams
enjoythis is the scariest game i have ever played
it has demon dogs birds and so on
you find your self running around silent hill a lot
just like in a couple resident evil games
the music makes the setting scarier
so does the fact that  of the game is set in the dark and you have a small flash light that only extends  feet infront of harry
the game is not really fun but if you like scary puzzle games and demon dogs this is a game for you
my advice dont play this in the dark
 im not easily scared
in fact of every quotscaryquot movie ive seen nothing has come close to unnerving me besides maybe in the mouth of madness
this game however is sufficiently creepy to make me love it and hate it at the same time
its almost masochistic playing it but maybe im masochistic because ive beaten it  times so far and i plan on playing it some more
it just scares the hell out of me every timei wont get into the plot as figuring it out is half the fun and you will have to do some figuring
im pretty sure a lot was lost in the translation from japanese because the story can be hard to follow at timesin order for the game to be rewarding though it requires patience along with nerves of steel and an iron stomach
the game starts out with a bang or a bunch of dead moaning faceless knife weilding babies stabbing you to death within  minutes of play i guess that counts as a bang right
this is misleading though as the game then calms down considerably for about the next  minutes of game time
before we go on though two things  the graphics are fairly blocky but for reasons that will become apparent this doesnt matter
theyre well textured which is much more important
 the sound is phenominal
always bear this in mindyou wander the fog enshrouded town of silent hill searching for your daughter
now heres the great part about this game
it just seems so wrong from the very beginning
the town is built right to scale and rendered in totality
you can in theory go anywhere
you even get a street map complete with names like koontz street and bachman ave get it
after a little exploration though youll find something is amiss
the goal early on is to get to the local elementary school and this seems easy enough with a street map but theres one minor problem
the streets have this tendancy to justend
all major roads leading to the school are just gone
not there
they stop and all you can see in the distance is the the fog
add to this the quotmonstersquot lurking the town
these basically consist of skinless dogs and large pink birdman things who dont seem so terrifying really
you get a radio that emits static when enemies draw near but more on that later
this is all part of the games attempt to unnerve you
before you know it youre across the chasm of the roads and now the real fun starts
now its suddenly dark
pitch black in fact
you get a weak little flashlight with which to see a pocket light really and thats it
now lets see
were in a deserted town haunted by things that while kind of weak and stupid looking want to kill you
we could see just fine in the fog but now its dark
right
so were off to the school and now things get worse
the dogs are faster now one constant in the game the darker it gets the more powerful and evil the enemies become and now that you cant see them it makes shooting at them much harder since they never stand still really and all you have to aim with is a weak cone of light that doesnt extend very far
plus as youll soon happily discover after wasting  clips firing at the spot where a dog just was ammo is limited
yay
and the dogs have now been joined by the bird thingies who also want to kill you
double yay
so we run now
run all the way to the school past the two
dogs guarding the entrance through the door and bam
were alive
woohoo
thank god
now thenthe school
then it dawns on you youre in a deserted elementary school
in the blackaspitch darkness
withwait for itthings that want to kill you
the knifebaby things this time
rightyo
having fun yet
oooh it gets better
after some puzzles youll open the clocktower
by this point it will be apparent that silent hill is home to some sick sick people
i wont go into details but trust me
so as you mutter to yourself about the sick inhabitants of this town youll be climbing down the clocktower yes down
it has a basement
wellsort of
youll see
its here here that the game got to me
when you come back up the other side bear with me here its hard to explain youre back where you started in the school courtyard
but not really
its not the samethen you go in the doors and everything isaw im not gonna kill it for you
suffice to say that this is where the game goes from creepy to insanely creepy and it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse as you go on
by the time you finish the school section and see daylight again its more of a relief than you can imagine
i was practically cheering my first time through
after that school welllit fog is a damned blessinglittle did i know i had a hospital to look foreward to
and yes as bad as you can possibly think it could be its worse
and when youre done with thatyoure not even halfway to the end yetthis game is all about the overhwelming sense of dread it will instill in you making you almost not want to play it anymore
ive had friends hit the hospital section take one look at their surroundings and hand me the controller and leave the room
its not that its overly gross its not
its just the prospect of having to subject yourself to the silent hill version of a freaking hospital that makes you almost cringe before you even start
and by the time you get there you know just what the term quotsilent hill version ofquot meansfor those brave souls who wish to do it alone which by the by i very very highly reccomend your first time through do it right
play it in the dark late at night alone with some good speakers set up
if youre new to it start at the beginning and enjoy the first part of the game
its a slow starter but once it gets going the only reason it lets up is to allow you to contemplate exactly what else its going to do to youbuy this game now if you havent played it and god help youoh and the second one is supposed to be twice as bad
i cant waitsilent hill is much scarier than the resident evil seriesit is much more demonic than the resident evil series and has more conflictsthis game is by far the most scariest game ive ever playedit is funner to watch though to me it isthe graphics are not good but the graphics make it scarier in a strange wayas far as the game playits pretty good but the game isnt meant for gameplay muchthe story is ver unique and goodits about harry trying to find his daughter and on his way a bunch of crazy stuff happenstheir is quite a bit of puzzles but there not too hardthis games so demonic and satanic its probably illegal for christians to play this gamejust sayin somethinif your lookin for something scary or demonic or anything then i reccomend playing this gamei speak as a fan of the franchise
i played the game when it first came out
i lost my original copy and felt like having it in my possession againpro great classic ps game dark scary theme the game is not for the easily scaredcon graphic nothing like ps slow paceproduct was like new
disc ran without skipping or freezing
unable to tell if there were scratches on it due to it being a playstation one disc but there didnt appear to be any
relive the town of silent hill with this classic horror gamestriaght out this is the scariest game you will ever play
its not only scary but highly enjoyable
im a major resident evil fan  until playing this game with its easily controllable camera angles creepedout scenes and great storylines  with the scene of the helpful nurse lisa being one of the most heartwrenchingthis is the frithening horror game ever created play in a dark room and discover the chilling experience in a video game i really love thisjust like movies some games remain timeless and just as influential today as they did back when they were released and silent hill is one of those gamesi had finished the game again a few weeks ago and just like the first time i played it the second time still gave me all the thrills and shrieks from the first timekonamis survival game made into a movie last year just hits it in the ballpark in every category
the graphics are outdated for sure but they are passable
the eerieness and morbid nature the game has is all done convincingly
iam glad i heard about the game and since i have gone on to play the other games from   and  harry mason is likeable enough persona to enjoy through the game
the other characters from lisa to dr kaufman and cybill bennet all leave a mark as wellthe controls are the typical easy controls you would get in something like resident evil
its a great example that you dont have to put everything in the game to make it cool just the basics
the multiple endings are also a great bonus that added replayability to an already great gameanyways this is a classiceven to this day playing this game gives me a wierd feeling
i remember first playing this game and forcing myself not to be scared only to find myself with a sick stomach and a paranoia about me
this game should not be played by people that thought resident evil  was as scary as it gets
this is by far worsewords cant explain the feeling of wandering around an abandoned school where little naked deformed children wield knives and wait for you to enter their class room just so they can dig at your throat
this whole game revolves around messing with the players mind in such a way it makes the player feel like they are there being tormented instead of good ol harry mason
harry mason is the hero of the game if you didnt already know whos searching for his adopted daughter in the town of silent hill
after his car breaks down in town he awakens to find his daughter missing
but there are clues to where shes gone and now harry must go and search every nook and cranny of this godforsaken town to find herthis game doesnt go without a few bad aspects though
the voice acting is classic in that it isnt very well done
youll hear such redundantcy as radio
whats going on with that radio
which is more funny that annoying
but the poor voice acting doesnt spoil the games mood at all
the graphics also take a little bit to get used to if youre used to superdeeduper psgamecubexbox graphics
for those of us who were brought up around classic ps games it wont bother you a bitto sum it up this game is fun and scary simultaneously and manages to induce panic upon its players
it is my favorite survivalhorror game even better than resident evil and i wouldnt hesistate to buy everyone in the series just because im a big fanatic of it
i recommend this game to anyone who loves resident evil or any other survivalhorror genre style game
but be warnedits not easy the first time around on the human mindnotesit should be known that this game is far better than the sequel apporpriately titled  silent hill there have been numerous rumors that tell of people that have been driven so insane by this game that they have actually committed suicide
so play at your own riskthis is an awesome old school videogame
item as described and disc is in good condition
id recommend buying thisgreat perfect art no time for action but time to run
great story and everything
id recomend this game being played rd of the series for more of a prologe feelingthis is quite possibly the most creepiest game ever
well it is the most  creepiest i have ever played the ultrarealistic graphics amazing cg  sequences spooky ooky musick and overall feeling to this is truly evil
i have played this many many times and it never gets boring and plus it  has great replay value not to mention the megakool alien ending
  this is a must for all hardcore gamerspros realistic grapics creepy  musick great replay value great storylinecons nonei was a relative chill game virgin until i played this gamei remember sitting in the dark of my room with my portable telly hooked up and a blanket over my headi thought i was ready i thought i had come well preparedmist engulfed me  i think i have been lost ever sincedevil dogs  alternate worlds an unborn heathen god  chaosbeautifully made and timeless  no wonder the movie gurus have nicked it for the big screenatmosphere in abundance  crippled corpses and radio interferencethere are hours of despair waiting here for you and a sense of time well spent  i enjoyed every moment my heart has never been the samei am finally playing this game
i played sh when it first came out skipped  and played  after i saw the movie
i went back and just beat rigins
i was able to track down the first three games for relatively cheap
and i must say playing sh on ps is still creepy and scary
it might not be as polished the later entries and definatly not as polished as the upcoming  still
if you can get your hands on this game and like real scary movies and games
if i had to twist this into the movie world
and compare re to sh
i would say re is obviously more like romeros living dead series with a little x files thrown in
while sh with the music mood and atmospheric setting wise its closer to psychoharry mason and his seven year old daughter cheryl are on their way to the lakeside resort known as silent hill for a peaceful getaway when a mysterious teenage girl appears in the headlights
harry swerves to avoid her and ends up crashing through a fence into silent hill
when he regains consciousness he finds cheryl is missing
the town seems to be completely abandoned save for a few abominations scurrying about covered in a thick blanket of fog and its snowingin july
he spots cheryl up ahead through the fog and calls out to her but she runs away from him
she escapes and he is now stranded in the town and is left to search for his missing daughter in a town that is periodically taken over by the otherworld aka hellif you think the town is creepy at first just wait
it gets much better
skinned bodies are hung from steal fence walls
faceless zombie children sneak up on you in the halls of the midwich school knives in hand
everything is drenched in blood and guts
screeches banging on a piano cockroaches the size of cats scuttling across the floor and nibbling on your toes the body of a decapitated dog whose head has apparently served as a childs basketball lies on the ground grunting gorillamen tackle you and tear out your throat nurses in the hospital pursue you with knives the ghost of a little girl runs past giggling headless ragdolls are nailed to the walls something in the room crashes but you turnand noones therethroughout the game youll eventually discover why the town keeps being invaded by the otherworld who is holding cheryl captive and why who the mysterious teenage girl in the road was and why she keeps appearing and youll meet a few interesting characters including the eccentric creepy old woman dahlia gillespie a girl named alessa whos past is truly horrific a female police officer named cybil a gruff hospital worker named michael kauffman and the sweet frightened nurse lisa garlandthe game terrifies many but it honestly didnt frighten me in the least although i loved the eery atmosphere the plot and the characters
speaking of which the plot is one of the deepest most involved video game plots youll ever see
after playing the game youll probably need to read a plot guide off of gamefaqscom in order to grasp everything and even then its a bear to take in everything
the writers are geniuses and dean koontz and stephen king would be proud to call the plot their own brainchildso how about the other three silent hill games
well i silent hill  was a fantastic game that i highly recommend it doesnt tie in to the first installments plot
ive played through  of silent hill  which is a sequel to silent hill  so try to play  before  and its good but dissapointing compared to the first two
silent hill  ive only played a tiny amount of as a rental but the opening movie was quite frighteningi love this gameit is scarysadand just the best everthe stoy line will have you hookedit claws at your emotionsthe sound if off the wall freakiethe graphics are very goodthey picked good voice actorsi do not sugguest this game to anyone who scares easlyother then that play this gamealthough outdated this game is a true classic
the silent hill series is an intelligent and more sophisticated alternative to resident evil
while it may not have the same level of fun as blowing the heads off of hordes of zombies the rich unsettling environments combine with eerie sounds and genuinely disturbing as opposed to just plain gross monster designs will draw you into the gamei dont know much about this game and never played iti bought it for a friend whom told me that he was going to pay me back for buying it for himhe never paid me for it and  i sent it back to the seller whim returned some of my moneyback in  i had never really played any kind of survival horror game ever in my life
a friend of mine came over to my house and brought silent hill and the playstation
i was just watching and i really liked how it had snow falling out in the town in the summer nonetheless it looked like a really scary game
then months later i borrowed this game from my friend and played from the beginning and didnt get really far because i really didnt know what to do
finally one night when my friend was back over at my house i was playing and he was sitting there watching and we were playing with surround sound the lights off and no one else was in the house
from the very beginning alley i was very scared
so i get to the school midwich elementary school and everything looks normal
my friend who was watching kept telling me that once i go through the clock tower i will be back at midwich elementary and that it will be the same school but at the same time it wouldnt be the same school and at that point i was really starting to freak out
i had no idea what horrors were waiting for mei go through the clock tower and i hear these really creepy sirens im to the point where i want to turn the game off but my friend was with me and kept telling me to move on
so i start to go into the school and once im in im freaking out
all the floors were replaced by metal grates with nothing below them the walls were like chained fences everything covered in blood pure horror and terror
i was really scared by the visuals and the music
something really creepy in the alternate school is when you go into one of the bathrooms on the first floor you end up on the second floor creepy
just everything that i saw and heard in every room and corridor scared me to death
i turned the game off after i was done in the school and couldnt sleep with the light off
i did eventually play through the whole game and beat it but i have never been so scared playing a video game in my entire life
the really scary music and sound effects play a big part
but whats really scary isnt just the atmosphere the music or visuals
it freaks me out thinking about why the town of silent hill is deserted and how samael came along
if i think about this stuff before i go to sleep a lot of times i cant sleep
the alternate hospital alchemilla hospital is another really scary place in the game that really scared me too but not as bad as the school
to be honest when i first was going through the alternate school the way it looked thats what i thought hell would look like it was so scary
to this day it scares me
sometimes even with the light on its scary
even though the graphics arent the best this silent hill game scares me more than silent hills   or  and they have better graphics
i would not recommend this game to anyone who scares easilythis is a game for the ps system
its got underwhelming graphics considering todays standards but its incredibly immersive as good as the best horror movies or books everything about the game oozes atmosphere and stylethe game play especially the movement is a little clunky though the emphasis is not on fast paced action so that is never and issue
the objective of the game is to go through a haunted town looking for a missing little girl while slowly discovering the back story of the town of silent hill
the puzzles are interesting and logical never too difficult or too weird though the game will seem a little little railroaded and constrained since some sections of the town are off limits at the beginning you will be following a set course throughout the game this is due to the nature of the eerie and slowly unfolding story
overall a great experience better than a horror movie anyhowsilent hill  will later top this story wise and become the best game in the series though this magic first experience will remain the most intensethis game is scary i love silent hill and if you like resident evil but want more psychologically frightening experience this game is for you
the game starts off with a cgi
cut scene of a you crashing your car in silent hill where you have to find your wife and daughter if you dont like this genre you wont silent hill if you didnt like resident evil because it was too hard in the puzzle department silent hill is about as hard
the game play is phenomenal
the game is so dark so that when enemies grab you you get so scared oh my god its scary
the music is amazing but for some reason the character model in the cut scene and the character model of your character in game play is alot different
over all i really enjoy this game and if you love survival horror you will tooi got this game for my birthday about years agoi finally beat the game todayi could have beaten it when i first got it but ikept puting it offi got to say i was very impressed with itit is probably one of the only games to ever make me jumpthe puzzles were fun and somewhat chalengingi also like the differnt endings to it but i wont tell about it if you have not beaten itover all a very good game and pretty good graphics for a psso if you like surrvival horrer check this one outi remember when this game first came out
everyone was thick on resident evil its all anyone ever talked about
i remember seeing a silent hill add in game magazine i picked up
it peaked my interest at the time
survival horror games were just starting thier popularity
i went down to my local funcolandyeah that long ago
remember them
and picked up a copy
no one knew what silent hill was about and at that time good luck finding something about it on the internet
all i had to go on where my whims and what the back of the case told about the gamethat my friends is exactly how this game was meant to be played
your not supposed to know whats going on
your supposed to have it slowly revealed to you as you play the game
it was first love as soon as i put the game in the original ps and was greated by an amazing opening screen with an unbelievable and memorable tune
i will never forget it
even with out pressing start i was already pumped up to play the gamesilent hill as you already know is the foundation for the series
staring harry mason a man who will go to any lengths to fins his daughter as she is the only family he has left
you really have to play this game to get a sense of just how well developed the story is
this is something that could easily have been a movie and not that sorry pos silent hill movie they made
as you play the game you get a real sense of desperation of a father that cares for his daughter and will go to any length to get her back
even if it means traveling through hell itself aka the town of silent hillthe gameplay of silent hill is similar to resident evil
pretty much the same controls and but with harder puzzles
it also includes a sense of realism that eludes itself from the typical health bar and ammo screen
playing silent hill  you feel more like a detective unraveling a mystery
your on the edge of your seat the entire way and you just want to know whats going to happen next because you honestly can never predict whats going to happen in this townthe game is more a phsycological thriller and thats one thing resident evil never real had
re brought the gore and zombies
you know what you were fighting and that it was man made ie
a virus
in silent hill its all supernatural and occult related
even to this day  years later this game still haunts me when i think about how scary it wasif your into horror games and dont mind not staring at the latest of graphics than pick up this old classic
silent hill was the one that broke the mold for what a survival horror should be
it combined mysteryactionadventuresuspensedrama and a story you would never forget
if you played the later silent hill games and enjoyed them specifically  or  then pick up the original because you will not be dissapointedsilent hill is a classic
this game proved that sometimes video games should be played by adults instead of little kids
this is the real deal
i firmly believe that the first three silent hill games are the scariest games ever made
there is just something torturous and macabre about these games u will not find it anywhere else and it all started with silent hill for the ps
enjoy and make sure to have some protection near bysilent hill revolutionized the survival horror genre by creating a world that attempts to scare the player on a deep psychological level
previous survival horror titles clock tower alone in the dark and resident evil relied upon sudden and unexpected encounters with enemies to get you to jump out of your chair whereas silent hill introduced a world of subconscious and was not simply a test of your reflexesthe basic story to this game has already been told so ill move on
there are so many elements that work together to make silent hill an excellent horror experience that it is hard to even begin writing what makes this title the best in survival horror
i guess ill start with the basicsi considered the graphics to this game one of the best during its time
better perhaps than the original resident evil
on my hd tv the pixels are more noticeable than they were on my regular tube but considering how into the game youll be this setback will quickly disappearthis is an exploratory game where you can tread every street of the new england town
often objectives are made very clear and the desired destinations are always marked on the ingame map
the map shows your current location the direction you are facing and where you have already been like a gps
its very unlikely youll ever get lost as you explore silent hill but dont think it will be a walk in the park
you will be faced with quite a few challengesstreets often have obstructions or mysteriously drop into oblivion and you have to search for hidden routes to reach desired destinationsstrange horrors come flying at you as you explore silent hill
harry carries a radio that screams white noise every time a demon is around
since the fog constantly obscures your vision and no street lights work at night you turn in circles with your gun pointing at unseen monstrosities the white noise getting louder the closer they make their way to youyou are required to solve many puzzles in order to advance in the game some of which are morbid poems you must analyze to extract the riddle of opening a locked door or to receive a vital iteminterrelated with the exploratory aspect of the game is the downright dark and haunting atmosphere of silent hell
in addition to the town and its many streets you will have to search a few buildings that harry suspects his daughter to be
imagine treading alone the dark halls of a rundown elementary school or the dank rooms of a deserted hospital or beneath the streets of an abandoned waterworks
imagine visiting a soulless amusement park at night where the spinning rides are devoid of any occupants
occasionally the sleeping haunted town goes into a deep rem state where buildings and streets and hallways shape shift
doors that were not there before are there now
streets that led one way go another
at first you may blame this on your own inattentiveness but eventually the changes of things will become too obvious for you to so easily blame yourself
walls formerly white will appear charred and rusted adorned with strung up corpses
the monsters become even more monstrous during these transformations
regular streets turn into metal gratings and through the gaps you can look into an endless void as if the whole town is just a floating rock teetering on the edge of reality and someones nightmarish delusions
and somewhere in this madness is your daughter and whats left of harrys sanity which he himself comes to questionthe music of the game pounds and screams often with no consistent rhythm that coheres perfectly with the insanity of the world you have just enteredas if that was not enough to go out and get this game arguably the best trademark of all the silent hill games is its ability to explain the chaotic world of silent hill through suggestion rather than the answers being spelled out for you in dialog or movie scenes cutscenes
this is a trick the japanese in general have implemented and mastered over the years
often the end result leaves a lot of topics open to discussion on silent hill forums
its usually up to the player to make an effort at interpreting the horrorthis is perhaps why silent hill is more effective as a horror game than other titles
the events that occur in the game is not of natural phenomena that can be explained by science like what we have with resident evil and alone in the dark nor is the problem as simple as trying to outrun a serial killer like what you have in clock towersilent hill works to scare you in so many ways a horror enthusiast that doesnt even play video games would find it worth their while to buy a ps just to play the series at least the first  games
its the one game that got me into gaming in the first placeand after you finish with silent hill although you may want to periodically return you can dive right into another very scary series of games called fatal frameif you have a ps you can download this game for  from psnjust sayinit is true this game will freak you out  not initially but gradually with the constant pang of tension and the unknownthere is one scene that really gets to me and its at the beginning
there are fallout shelter sirens going off as the character goes into the warped dream world hes surrounded by rusty gates with a poor light to guide him and then you hear a bunch of voices footsteps and other noise until you turn around to see a huge crowd of baby zombie like creatures  when you try to run  another set comes at you the other way until your engulfed in themthen you wake up and you start off in a crashed suv wondering where your daughter isthe rest just gets back on the nerve train from there and as someone mentioned the school house
the school house it self is a nerve wrecking experience since it involves an empty place that used to have children in it and the finger painting in blood on the walls the hollow foot steps of shadow beings and emptiness builds up another psychological tensioneven in the fog the winged creatures may look lame but the sound of that radio cracking and knowing something is coming at you is still a jolt to the nervesfor the modern viewer i would say this game is a cross between the boiler roomrusty dungeon dream world of freddy kruger in nightmare on elmstreet mixed with the myst  by stephen kingbrutal game
a must have
you also must play this in the dark to get the full affect starssilent hill is an exceptional game
it is dark fun creative extremely involving and more than anything it is downright creepy
the story is simple and the main character is easy to relate to
after all harry mason is just a regular joe wandering around completely clueless in search of his missing daughter
he can barely hit the side of a barn with his pistol and only has a tiny weak flashlight which greatly limits his vision
right before some nasty creature attacks him he gets a burst of static on his radio
believe me that burst of static will get your heart pumping as you get a little too involved in this game
the graphics are a little coarse but somehow that does not deter from the game itself as the entire game is shrouded in darkness or fog
controls are tight and simple to learn
this game is beyond cool even if it does look like someones bad acid trip inside out creatures ghostchildren weilding knives etc
it is challenging creative and original and makes killing zombies in the resident evil series seem trite and simple
the sound effects are great and add considerably to the eerie atmosphere of the game
replay value is high as there are several different endings that you can achieve based on gameplay
if you are a fan of the re series or dino crisis or any survival horror video buy this game
you will not be disappointedwhen i got silent hill for playstation i knew i was going to like it but i didnt expect it to be so scary
the opening was really cool
it got the scariest when i got to the school and little zombie children were chasing me around with knifesi played this game with the lights off and i slept with the lights on
this game is about a normal man named harry who is looking for his missing daugther cheryl in a town called silent hill i think that this game is not for the queasy at heart this game contains scenes of violent images and has a lot of jumpy partsunlike resident evil which i do love too the control are not awful and harry is just a regular guy with no experience with a gun and he has no idea what is going on which makes it  times scarier than any resident evil game
i think if you want a game as close to a horror movie as possible this is the game for you
go buy it when you canthis is not a resident evil clone nor does it follow in its foot steps
silent hill gives you a different kind of evil the pyschological thrillerthe difference between silent hill and resident evil or others like them is that silent hill is pyschologically scary
resident evil is set within a realistic world where the horrors that happen are concrete machinations of a tangible force
in other words its based in reality and has boundaries set within the human world
it is  explainable
and once you know what exactly is happening to cause all this weirdness then its not as scary anymore
the world you tread in becomes a byproduct of the entity youre trying to get at
in silent hill youre fighting against the world itself and youre not sure exactly what is causing all this until the endunlike the jerky scary quotbooquot moments that resident evil plays on silent hills spookiness grows on you with its creepy environments
the music sound effects and graphics are just icky enough to grow on you  not to shock you
the shocking part comes when you start enountering things that try to kill you
instead of blasting zombies you are literally escaping a sort of madness that is trying to envelope the ground you walk ontheres also no corny voice acting which resident evil is also famous for to get in the way
combat is not going to be filled with shotgun blasts and blood spray although there is a shotgun because your character isnt designed to be ramboresident evil is great but i would go for the pyschological thriller than a slasher flick
if youre just looking for a game to scare you out of your wits you cant get any better than these two original hitstheres something about this quiet little resort town that seems to draw all the darkness together into one place all the madness from deepseated nightmares into one name silent hill
the name itself evokes visions of twisted creatures and primal fears come to life and its been this way for years after four games several comic series and a feature film
but here is where it all started the game that introduced us to the little town of silent hillit begins with a compelling hook  harry mason is driving along a lonely road with his seven yearold daughter cheryl when he is driven from the road and crashes
when he regains conciousness cheryl is gone and harry is stuck in silent hill
the rest of the game becomes an increasingly desperate search for harrys daughter leading not only into the depths of the town and its many secrets but also into his own past and into the depths of his sanityas harry travels through the town he meets other characters  cybil bennett a police officer also trapped in the town like him dahlia gillespie priestess of an ancient religion lisa garland a nurse haunted by something she has seen and alessa a girl who seems to be at the center of the mystery of the town itself
he amasses weapons to fight the many creatures in the town twisted creations of a demented mind and finds objects to help him solve puzzles along the way
and as he progresses he travels between worldsfrom this worlds dangers to the warped otherworld of silent hill where nothing seems to make sense but everything is connectedeven playing silent hill today in the time of hyperrealistic games fullscale production on par with hollywood and highdefinition graphics the original silent hill still stands the test of time
it is challenging and production values are high given the limitations of the time it was made
the original playstation graphics may seem a little choppy by modern standards but in a way this works for the game too giving it a surreal quality as harrys perspective shifts from one reality to another
there is a minimalistic approach to the look of the whole game that works for it rather than against it  the old concept that the less you show the greater the potential fear is
voice acting is a little shaky but this is more than made up for by the quality of moodsetting sound effects and music which create a constant and everescalating sense of dreadin the world of survivalhorror games some go for the gorefest and others for cheap thrills
silent hill stands apart as a game that tells a compelling story and accompanies every moment of that story with a shot of pure creeping fear
its not the kind of game to make you feel queasy or get your heart pumping but it evokes the feeling of shivers running up your spine like cold fingers and skin that doesnt seem to feel comfortable anymore on your bonestheres a reason the very name of silent hill makes people quiver just a little
take a look at where it all began and find out for yourselfafter playing  silent hill  once i realized how great it actually is
sure you have to know when to run  and when to fight 
but some of the stuff in the game totally freaks  you out 
dont play it with the lites off 
the zombie nurses make you jump out of your skin 
the mutant babies are scary as hell too 
want a cool game to make you turn on all the lights in your house 
then this is the game 
buy it or rent it 
at all costs 
and look out for the sequel on  playstation   this winterback in  i purchased a copy of resident evil directors cut mostly because id been exposed to the original verion at a friends place and thought it was interesting
the shotty dialogue was a bit annoying but the game itself was done very well with good graphics a puzzlesolving integration and some really interesting monsters
so when silent hill rolled around i thought i should see how konamis take on the survivalhorror genre would be
i wasnt let down and silent hill quickly became one of my favorite ps titles of all timeyou play as harry mason a single dad with a young sevenyearold daughter named cheryl
youre on a vacation trip to try to get away from it all when a mysterious woman appears in the middle of the road
frantically you jerk the wheel of your jeep to avoid hitting her only to end up crashing into a ditch
you lose consciousness and awake to find youre engulfed in a strange fog and cheryl is missing
you dont know where you are or whats around you but you know youve got to get cheryl backsilent hill features the entire layout of the town of silent hill
the buildings the streets the signposts mailboxes benches trees and everything else are all carved out for you to explore
it features an array of strange twisted enemies to fight and a small stock of different weapons you can use to defeat them with
but most important of all the scenarios become twisted and nightmarish as night falls and you jump into another dimension with scenes so frightening youll just be thankful youre not harry himselfinstead of the usual videogame music playing as you run around the town the game features a soundtrack of creepy noises and other sounds that keep you on edge
your pocket radio crackles with static when enemies are nearby and the sound effects of the environment chill you to the boneany other horror film game or soundtrack youve experience before are sundayschool lessons compared to silent hill
its definitely worth owning but you might want to rent it first to see if youre ready to be that terrified
and dont forget to check out silent hill  and silent hill  in august this is a brilliant game and one of the best games i have ever played
a master peace from start to endthe offseasons always dead in the lakeside resort town of silent hill but not this dead
it seems that the entire town is deserted except for harry mason a distraught motorist in search of his missing daughter and cybil bennet a beutiful police officer from a neighboring community dispatched to silent hill to discover why all communication from the sleepy resort town has ceased
where has everyone gone
is the small shadowy figure that constanly eludes harry his daugher cheryl
if so why does she run from him
bracing himself against the winter chill harry sets off into the unnaturally thick fog to investigateremember youll get scared with this game you wont sleep at night be sure before buying thisi am a silent hill fanatic
i can not begin to describe how amazing this game is it has everything you need in a video game a great story amazing atmosphere symbolism and a way to scare the living crap outa you
this came out  years after the first resident evil game now let me just say somthing i like resident evil but it is just not as great as silent hill
now lets actually get this review startedthis game starts off like this you are harry mason the right man in the wrong place
you wake up after a car accident to find that your daughter cheryl is gone
now you must search for her in the dark terrifying town of silent hill
along the way you will meet some odd people it also has alot of twist and turns
this game has most probably best storyatmosphere ever it actully makes you feel like your in the town of silent hillthe game controls are the same as resident evil although it is clunky it actully feels like needed unlike in resident evil your a god damn cop in resident evil in silent hill your just an average joe
there is alot of stuff im missing out i might add the other stuff review
silen hill one for the psps viva psn gets a  outa   this zombiedude sighing offthis may not be the sequel but it is still a very fun game to keep the metal gear solid fan occupied
one of the best features is that you get to be the ninja
get this game if you like mgs or the ninjahad this one when i was a kid back in  and i sold it  and now being a mgs collector i had to buy it againcame as described   brand new factory sealedthis game was released after the ps hit metal gear solid the one that started all it contains over  missions of vr training from sneaking to weapons to variety  even puzzle missionsfun to play and you can spend alot of time mastering to get the goldby the time of writing this it has already been released on psn as a digital download but if you are a metal gear collector  its always good to have the hard copyi am a serious metal gear fan and for any one who liked the vr missions  on substance will absolutely love this
and as a side note i am getting mgs intregial and maybe the subsistance limited editiongot the old school metal gear soild vr missions for my ps and starting playing it and oh man i started remember my childhood playing it on my brothers ps back in  and still play it today soul reaver is a very intelligent and extremly fun rd person game
it has some of the finest graphics and absolutly no loading timethe game has a great storyplot
the story of the gameplay just keeps getting  better and better as you go on
fighting all sorts of villians and bosses
collecting glyphs and life crystels
the fun keeps on goingin the  game you are part of an elite vampire group
until one century you evolve  before your master and this displeases him
so he sends you off and kills  you
after the longest time you get risen by some god and you seek out  revenge on your once bretheren
the game has sophisticated fighting and  many different items to pick up along the way from a piercing spear to an  energy sword which is attached to your armone other neat thing about it  is the  worlds it has
you can switch from the under world to the real  world when you please
attacking the spirits of the dead in the under  world and attacking the living in the real world
both sides you dont suck  blood anymore you suck their soulsdont wait long this game is a  mustbuyi bought and played this game in  when it was already several years old
i had watched a review about it on tv a year before that and the price was quite reasonable at the time i purchased itwith not so many expectations i was awestruck at the level of detail and creativity poured into the story the characters the dialogue the music as well as the graphics leveldesign and playabilityjust search the web for keywords such as raziel kain soul reaver blood omen and you will see for yourself how intense this storyline has proved to be
there are many fan sites out there thriving on the epic characters and universe that the legacy of kain series have created so gracefullya few of the key elements i found captivating about the gameplay is the fact that there were no loading screens keeping you waiting
the game seemlesly loads the respective portions from the cd as you walk aroundanother feature that caught my attention is the ability to destroy your opponents in several different ways which all of them by the way clearly display the power of hatred and vendetta gathered within your game character razieli recommend this fantastic piece of game which delivers art in all forms you can imagine audio video literature to all of you
but know before you buy that the graphics although still beautiful may not live up to the expectations of some of you out there who have started gaming very recently or can only be impressed by nothing more than a quakeengine running on the latest d accelerator video cardventuring into the wells of my memory i have found this item stored within a cubicle of dusty thought where long nights of fantastical imagery filled my pupils and my sighti know its a bit of an oldy but i just had to review it
being an addicted gamer to this genre of games when i first came upon legacy of kain soul reaver i was warped and enmeshed within this amazing game and its engrossing storylineyou havent played it yet
to further expand your vision of when i played this game ill let you know that i played it on my sega dreamcast
what
yes it was millenia ago in gaming console time since they come and go so quickly
the main character is a vampireturnedwraith called raziel lieutenant to the vampire lord kain
raziel is betrayed by his master as he tears his wings and casts him into the lake of death and as his body is consumed the elder god spares his soul to become his minionhis soul reaverto pursue his personal vendettathe game is amazing visuallyat least it was  years ago
the vampirewraith is a gory bastard as he devours the souls of those who he viciously assassinatesthe story takes place in a world called nosgoth where the health of the land is tied to the nine pillars of nosgoth each pillar in turn is represented by a guardian
before the soul reaver was created the guardians became corrupt and kain slew them one by one not knowing that he was the last pillar of them refusing to sacrifice himself for the wellbeing of the land
this promoted the decay of nosgoth and to ruin the world kain created an army of vampires among which raziel was generated
the humans have been decimated and the vampire tribes have claimed the world of nosgoth
despair and inglorious demise has coupled peace with a blinding and silent furythrilling plot and amazing gameplay
as raziel you must solve a load of mysteries and puzzles to finally attain revengeif you can get this game and play it its highly recommended
youll be entrapped within the walls of its accursed gameplay addictivedespite a somewhat disappointing ending this game is without a doubt one of the most indepth fps available
the stealth that must be used to accomplish missions will forever change what is considered when levels are built for fpssdesigned by team who were among the first to realize that people were getting fed up with wading through  hours of mission and than compleating the game
in this game the object is not to kill everybody rather it is to not get caught
while i personally liked the sequal a lot better than i liked the orginal the dark project deserves to be remembered as the first game that tried to thisusing the shadows you playing the master theif gareet will win the day
the only thing i didnt like about the game was that you spent more time fighting animals and zombies that actual peopleoverallgreat game remember to turn your gamma controls all the way up guys ratingsintensity of gameplay playability fun factor plot amp story character ive never played a game that i didnt find more intense and involving than thief
if you enjoy tense atmospheres this game gives you a feeling of being the hunter and the hunted at the same time
eidos made an excellent type of game here but it could use a better storyline
while you may not play it much after the first  times through its extremely enjoyable
it sure beats going to rent  movies that you may not like for the same pricewell after playing thief i reply this game for people who ask quotwhat is the best game you have ever playedquot
thief is a classic and it is not a game for faint hearted quothalflife counterstrikequot people
the game is not designed for people who run around madly with a blazing gun dying every  seconds you have to wait you have to look you have to be witty and quiet while playing the game you can turn off torches by firing a water arrow and you can sneak through the darkness you created walking on metal ground attracts guards while walking on a carpet is the ultimate way of sneaking after playing this game  i am no longer afraid of darkness as darkness will be your only allythe graveyard level was brilliant
i have never been so scared  not since i was five watching dark shadows after preschool
i love this game as all the others who gave it  starsfor maximum effect play the graveyard scene at night when youre all alonethat said i would love to pick up a new scary game

the game is a musthave for any fps or rpg game loversthief the dark project is one of the best first person shooter game and an important part in fps historythief has a great story and is just fplain fun to play  a cool character stalking through beautiful immersive scenery not to kill but to steal
but its true innovation and one that will be copied from forever is its semiintelligent characters
nothing like them had been seen in any video game before
they dont just stand in one place they patrol and they react to both sound and light
create too much of a disturbance and theyll raise an alarm
otherwise they might just look around for you a little
they look real they sound real
much has been said about the creatures and yes in the early days of d first person gaming they were good but they were also quite typical
its the attempt at artifical intelligence that is really interesting here
and the sneaking and subterfuge aspects that will play so important a role in so many later titles like hitman and elder scrolls oblivionof secondary interest is the subject matter no one to save so real quests to complete or ultimate badguy enemy to topple just profit to be made by stealing things and what you choose to do with your illgotten gainsokay if youre one of those kids i see hanging around in the software store fidgeting and constantly moving around anxiously picking up one box and tossing it aside to pick up anotheror if you love your console system and dont understand the benefits of gameplay depths the pc offersor if you cant stand microsoft flight simulator because you cant shoot anythingthen this game is not for youive been reading a lot of negative reviews here apparently from year olds who dont understand the meaning of subtlety
no you dont go around shooting things constantly
you must sneak quietly and stay in the shadows
and when a passerby suddenly discovers you you will feel a surge of adrenaline unlike that which can be found in a typical twitch shootercompleting a mission here takes hours and brings a great feeling of accomplishment
also there is a wonderful focus on exploration
be patientas don henley said quotlearn to be stillquotat the time this came out st person shooters were very common
quake quake ii unreaql all promising great action great engines etcbut then came thief sneaking into the market as stealthily as garrett himself
for those that had the fortune of trying out this unmarketed little game got something they have never seen beforea st person action game that forced them to thinkfrom its opening moments you adapt the body and the attitude of garrett a cynical thief whose greed is bigger than his fears
as you solve mission after mission you become more in tune with youyr abilities and become as brash and cocky as the excellent voiceover of your alterego
very stylish and very medieval it is the only game ive ever played that has made me feel like i was part of medieval timesthe interface is similar to others ive played but addition of the bow and arrows makes this game truly stand out from the other shooters
the sword and the blaster are no longer your favored weapon and there is no bfg
it is brains and agility that are the weapons of choice
there are many different types of arrows you can use such as water such that will douse torches from across the room so you can further sneak in the dark noisemaker to make useful distractions moss so you can tread upon noisy surfaces unheard and others
surface sounds
yes
thief the dark project has better sound and sound effects than any game i have ever played
it is truly amazing
you can hear conversations among the guards whistling walking and the sound of people walking changes as they step on different surfaces moaning zombies and many moreall with the right perspective
guard around the corner through a door sound muffled sounds legitimately are placed in the areaspeaker youd actually hear them in and yes water that sounds cool and refreshingthis game is a marvel in storytelling
one that truly goes on the top  alltime greats lista quiet revolution on launch thief plays like a cross between rainbow six and the old playground favourite whats the time mr wolf
as a sneaky thief you have to steal your way through a series of absolutely  enormous atmospheric steampunk levels avoiding guards laying traps  and hiding in the shadows
like almost everything by the late lamented  looking glass thief is intelligent wellpresented extraordinarily  deep and commercially only sosothe standout elements are the  excellent shadowy level designs and the spooky tense atmosphere
your  character is no good at fighting and you have to sneak around behind  people who might turn around at any minute often in dark rooms sometimes  in haunted caverns
imagine a really scary ghost story crossed with the  tension of bomb disposal and youre there
the level design is highly  original  the level set in a giant sarcophagous in which you turn corners  to find yourself facetoface with large gasbreathing dinosaurs is an  alltime classicnot much is wrong with thief  even the betweenlevel  fmv sequences are excellently done
compared to something like halflife  the graphics are relatively primative but the engine is doing a lot more
often the hugeness of the levels makes working your way through the game  seem impossible at time and although your character is a thief it would be  nice if he was at least competent with the sword
apart from that buy  itits best to hunt out the gold version now on budget  that added  three new levels a level editor and some bug fixeswhen gamers talk about a game which redefines a genre of games thief is the type of game they mean
its not just playing the same sort of game in a new way its taking the core concept of a genre and going in a completely different direction
it makes a new game out of a familiar concept
in one elegant stroke thief takes the concept of the firstperson shooter and completely flips it around greatly expanding the potential of what an fps game can beimagine if you will a firstperson shooter in which it is not necessary to kill everything and everyone who crosses your path
there are a few like that
thief takes it a step further though
killing is messy says your character at one point
while playing the game in expert mode a stated goal of many of the missions is specifically not to kill anyone
rather than heavy weaponry and the adrenaline rush of charging an infinite horde of beasties the goal in thief is subterfuge subtlety and patience
most especially patiencethe game is also quite replayable by choosing different playing styles for yourself
some players choose to play by not killing or knocking anyone out at all except when a mission requires it which is rarely
though i myself have not yet played through the game this way i can see the challenge and fun it would presentthats not to say you cant fight in it
it wouldnt be a firstperson shooter if that were the case
but no your character garrett is a thief equipped with a sword for close work and a bow for pretty much everything else
since garretts handtohand skills with the sword arent the greatest using ranged attacks with the bow is generally preferable and more in keeping with the theme of the game
you can shoot someone or something with an arrow from the shadows and get away with it far more easily than you can try to hack at them with a sword
and dont forget to hide the bodies when youre done as leaving them lying around will make it much more likely you get caught by anyone youve overlooked
youre also equipped with a blackjack for rendering guards unconscious which comes in quite handy when the need for silence is paramountsound unlike most fps games is one of the key elements of gameplay in thief
sound can give your enemies away just as it can give you away to their ears
sound can be used to distract and confuse your enemies as well
different surfaces yield different sounds and changing your walking speed can dramatically effect the sounds you make
walking on wood yields a hollow thump while walking on grass makes a gentle crunching noise
walking on stone gives off a harsh clacking but walking on carpet is nearly silent
walking on metal produces a resounding clang which can be heard for quite a ways
the sounds you make become your enemies as much as the sounds your enemies make become your friends
sound is an important tool in this game unlike any otherof course the visual aspect is important too and its just as key to gameplay
as a thief often evading confrontation rather than inviting it your best bet is generally to stay in the shadows as much as possible letting guards and others pass while you remain unseen waiting
a light meter at the bottom of the screen helps you know when you are visible to others and when you are not but the excellent lighting effects of the game provide plenty of clues as to which areas are safe and which are brightly lit
when you need darkness in a lit area sometimes the only way to get it is to put some torches out for yourself
the graphics of thief are very good overall but the lighting effects are what really stand out in terms of excellence especially due to the fact that light is as critical a tool and sound
bear in mind that the dark places in thief can hide an enemy just as effectively as it can hide you and sometimes they dowith its close attention to detail and its careful use of light and sound to enhance the experience thief is one of the most effectively immersive games i have ever played
i am reminded of the first time i played doom or quake and i saw the first glimmerings of what the fps genre could do
thief takes that concept and extends it much further forcibly making the player pay closer attention and thus get involved in the world of the game much more deeply than other games have ever required
thief tasks the player to examine every shadow jump at every little sound and take chances on the best way through tight situations
couple this involvement with a top quality storyline worthy in itself of a bigscreen treatment and youve got a fantastic game  which is exactly what thief is fantastic
thief made me relearn everything i ever thought i knew about playing a firstperson shooter
my instinct to shoot first and deal with the consequences later fell quickly by the wayside as that is the surest road to ruin in thief
this game taught me to rely much more on stealth than brute strength cunning more than a heavy arsenal and it made quite a difference
in fact it made all the difference and it made thief a truly exceptional gaming experienceslip into the shadows
walk carefully
look
listen
observe everything
choose your targets carefully and only attack when absolutely necessary
be crafty as the fox
be silent as the breeze
be invisible
be a thiefquake and unreal and halflife are all excellent games but most of the time in these games you are expected to be bold and crazy
you hold a  shotgun and run and dash shoot everything that moves
but in thief if  you act like youve always done in quake or others then the game will be  over ie
you die in a very short time
in thief you must walk slowly  stop and wait think the next step retreat sneak hide listen  assassainthis is really a great game
this is totally for connoisseur  for those who had been tired of run and shoot blindly for those like  tactics for those who can wait and are sly enough
in thief it takes much  more time to complete a level than other person action games but it  deserves
never had a game make quotwaitquot a fun and exciting thing  and now thief succeedi spent many months playing this game and finally reached the ultimate goal  level  and there was absolutely nothing left to do
throughout my entire time to level  i spent hour after hour killing the same things  over and over and at times sitting in the same spot for hours sometimes  even days just to get one particular itemi will admit the game is fun  at times but ultimately more frustrating than anything
i only recommend  this game to extremely patient people with an insane amount of free time on  their handsedit its been over  years since ive reviewed this game
all i can say is it really was the best game i ever played
nothing will ever come closei purchased this game when it was first released in february of   it is very addictive and the game has gone through numerous expansions and changes since its enception
although the play dynamics were very boring when the game first came out it has improved greatly
it has a group based play system which means you have to combine your character skills with other characters skills to accomplish a goal to defeat a creature or mob as they are called in game
some mob bosses requiring up to  or more players to defeat
after a kill the the player or players earn experience and collect any items or coin that drop
some characters classes are soloable but most arentother things players can do is learn a trade skill which requires lots of coin or platinum pieces
the higher the skill level of a player the more likely they are to produce items that will sell for a nice profitplayer run guilds are also an option for players to join
to join a guild often requires a long trial period before the guild leaders decide if a character is suitable or not
ten players are required and some form of organizational documentation for gms to allow a player to start a guild
many guilds have their own websites and forumsusually the game doesnt start getting interesting until a character gets past level  or so
the upper levels  provides the highest opportunity in the game and the most enjoyment
be prepared to die alot in all levelswith the game being six years old starting a new character maybe somewhat difficult since most players are  and grouping has a  level spread
there are low level characters in the game they just have to be foundthe game has many more features
i have only mentioned the most prevelant onesi absolutely love this game i am still playing through it as i write this and will be sad once i am done with the game
i dont understand all the harsh remarks i am reading in other reviews but the this game is an excellent choice if you are looking for an all around superior fps type game to play
the storyline is totally engrossing and compelling and the graphics old engine or not are the some of the most beautifully done ive seen to date in some levels even breathtaking
i hope those of you who are reading these reviews wont take any of the harsh ones to heart without first playing daikatana and seeing how awesome it is
i cant say enough about it
i loved it and gave it all  stars for superior gameplay graphics and storyline
a truly incredible game daikatana rocksi understand the vast diversity of comments and judgements regarding this game
it may not be the right choice for everyone
if youre into state of the art graphics and gameplay you will probably not like itif however you consider yourself an old school gamer who still loves quake  heretic  and the like you will most definitely be mesmerized by this game
also if you are into great storytelling and fantastic voice acting and soundeffects you are in the right placedaikatana is like a pearl in a shell
you need to get past its rough edges to experience its glorythe game has better more and less cliched sound effects than most recent playstation and xbox games
it also sports some neat visuals just crank up the resolution and it still shines
the story is nothing short of incredible and would make an excellent movie
not to mention the awesome variety of  different time periods and unique weapon sets in each
daikatana never gets repetitive
as soon as you think youre getting the idea you move on to a totally different timeperiod with unique surroundings sounds enemies music weapons mission designquests
even recent shooters on pc ps and xbox lack that variety
trust me im a hardcore player and have experienced games for the last  yearsdaikatana also has a unique style something between scifi martial arts cartoon and manga  everyone who loves ghost in the shell and the like must cravepersonally i love both stateoftheart games as well as old school games
and boy let me tell you doom halflife and the like can learn a whole lot in terms of storytelling and sounddesign from good old daikatanagive this a shot if you need a break from the stateoftheart  page manual games and what some decent fraggin and a gamingworld to get lost in for many many many hours dont listen to the critics  they are not always right
you may really miss out on something cool the pearl inside the shellthis game is sweet and when killing monsters gets annoying for level gaining unlike diablo this game has number cheats meaning you hit number on the keyboard
although a gamepad or usb adapter is highly recconmended you should get this all the samethis is such a sweet game
its got  great graphics for its time immersive gameplay totally interactive and huge enviorments and a good storyline
i am totally addicted to this game i cant put it down
i love this game and i would definitly recommend this to any actionadventure gamers
to me this game is a dreamcast classicheroes of might and magic iii is the best heroes game yet
 was okay but it lacked upgrades and  was great but this leaves it way behind
with eight castle types each with fourteen different creatures seven normal and seven upgraded sixteen types of heroes two from each town and three sides good evil neutral youll have hours of strategic fun
the battle engine remains the same where you and the army you form attacks other armies towns or just wandering monsters in a turnbased fight
now though certain soldiers have special powers over others
for example angels and devils have hatred toward each other so when one attacks the other they inflict almost triple damage
other hatreds include giantstitans and redblack dragons and geniesmaster genies and efreetiefreeti sultans
the way you form armies is you build your towns and you recruit creatures from their dwellings note not all creatures are generated from towns some you must find elsewhere
you build your town by finding resources and gold then buying structures
you can recruit many different kinds of soldiers for your army including dragons giants griffins minotaurs vampires cyclopes and hydras
some of the ways to play are  doing a normal standalone mission where you are given objectives  doing a campaign where you do many missions that tell a story  creating your own mission in the map generator a very cool touch or  playing either  or  in multiplayer mode
the depth graphics and fun of this game are endlesseach game in the homm series is remarkable for adding to the gameplay the complexity and the richness of the original idea while preserving the basic playability and worthwhile strategy elements found nearly a decade ago in the games ancestor quotkings bountyquot
its extremely rare to find  a sequel that improves on the original without rendering them obsolete
homm i and homm ii are today almost as playable as this game lacking only  the polish and convenience that comes from so many years of refinement
this is only achieved by making the game different enough so that you have  to change or refine your thinking about ithomm iii features more of  everything that made the first two good adds the necessary new twists to  the basic gameplay such as a tactics skill with allows you to reorganize  your troops before battle and an underground map and brings the level of  graphics up to modern standards
graphics have never been the hallmark of  this chesslike game though theyve always had a unique flair to them
the  graphics in this game are more modern but somewhat less uniquely stylized  as a result
as always the music is both epic and catchythe  campaigns are a little better fleshed out as well though the game itself  is still primarily a standalone chessstrategolike experience
the  quotgame is a unitquot experience is somewhat offset by being able to  use heroes from one game in the next game
this feature unique to this  sequel has a distinct impact on how one plays the campaignsive always loved the might  magic series and this one is no exception
i love first person turnbasedparty games
i have been dumb enough to periodically waste money on some of the various third person games out there like baldurs gate and neverwinter nights but i hate third person and cannot get into it at all
might  magic does not have that problemthis game along with mm and mm are pretty much in the same format with a few tweaks
that is fine with me
i have become so engrossed it them that i have played all three of them at least three times each
there is no other game that even comes closedespite the crudeness factor i love the graphics
the spell system is just right and i dont mind all the monster bashing
the story kept me engaged each time i played even knowing the outcome the second and third time aroundi just wish someone would continue the series in the same format with maybe d graphics but the same game play and all the rest
i give a hats off to the might  magic tribute people who are doing it on their own since no company seems interested in doing ithighly recommendedi really only played this game for  hours back when i first bought it years and years ago
ever since then ive kept the nd cd handy for my listening pleasure
its great to sleep to great to relax to when youre doing anything from chillin out to working on the computer etc
its very very wellcomposed
it blends so many various musical elements that i havent heard blended as such before
so many themes can be heard throughout elements of irish scottish classicalbaroque and just fullon ambience with the use of voices and many many instruments
one of my favorite tunes on here starts with a very intriguingly haunting chromatic piano part with overlayed violin and cellos coming in with a beautiful minor progression that sounds like it shouldnt fit but absolutely does
the result is a disorientingly beautiful piece of music that builds into a grand change fit for a great movie ala braveheartan audiophile will hear that the instruments are obviously synthcreated but the samples sound great and real enough to more than get the job done
this is great music to get lost in
theres depth to the compositions and many layers to pick out during any given passage most of the time
the usage of the instruments isnt repetitive either
sometimes the drums have a very wet reverb applied to them and certain instruments sound as though theyre recorded dynamically with different mic positions in different roomsso from what little i played the game it was fun but the  star rating comes from me rating this game solely on the listening enjoyment of the music
ive had this game for somewhere from  years if im not mistaking and even at this very moment im enjoying the music even more than i have before
definitely worth it just for the music alonei just recently have found myself owning a playstation and you need games to use it properly right
well i rented this gem and let me tell youwhat fun
i had never before in my life played any tomb raider  title i knew that they were quite popular so i thought that id give it a  try
at first i was really madi own a n so i was used to a certain kind  of game control and it wasnt the kind that tomb raider the last  revelation uses
i kept thinking quotwhat is the big fussyou cant even  control her
what is everyone thinking
this is so twisted and  sickquot
i worked at it and soon found out why laras adventures are  wildly popular
they are so fun
i got used to moving larai dont use  the joystickand soon was having so much fun that i never want to put the  game away
searching through the ancient egyptian tombs is a blast
i am  really into to egypt so i may be a bit partial to the scenriobut i cant  help it
so far the game is quite a challenge it makes you think finally  accomplishing whatever puzzle you are stumped at it a great feeling and i  dont look forward to returning itwhich means i have to make a purchase  very soon
i ordered tomb raider classic because it was a good  priceyou can beat that and i think i should start at the beginning  anyway but dont worry i will pick this title up toothe graphics are  great and the training level was very very helpful
like i said i havent  played any of the other games in the series but i look forward to trying  those out as well
when all is said and done this is a great game and i am  very happy to tell you about itafter three incredibly successful games in the form of tomb raider tomb raider  and tomb raider  lara croft returned in november  with tomb raider the last revelation
the previous two games didnt really live up to the title of tomb raider as there werent many tombs involved at all but the last revelation takes advantage of its trademark name by putting lara back into the tombs  where she belongs
this was the third tomb raider game i bought after tomb raider and tomb raider  and i have to say it is one of the most exciting and enjoyable games i have ever played
the offical playstation magazine says   an atmospheric beautiful wonderfully crafted game
and you know what
theyre absolutely rightthe story of the last revelation is very intricate  gripping without being too unbelievable
while exploring egypt lara discovers the lost tomb of the ancient egyptian god set
he was outwitted and imprisoned in a secret tomb and warns that he will one day return to seek vengance
lara unwittingly unleashes its ancient evil fulfilling the prophecy that threatens to plunge mankind into eternal darkness
in a race against time lara must use all her wit and skill to reimprison set to save the world from unspeakable evil and armageddon
the last revelation begins with a flashback level from the s when lara was  on her first exploration in angkor wat cambodia
she is led around by her mentor werner von croy
this is really just a training level that teaches new tomb raider players the ropes on how to control lara
after this the game really begins  in the present day
we learn that on their escape from the tomb in cambodia lara left von croy to die after the tomb began to collapse around her
its not long however until we find out that mr von croy is indeed alive and well and on the look out for lara to get revenge
the game is split into six different sections training levels recovering the amulet of horus discovering the truth the search for the armor the search for jeanpierre and the final conflict
this game has been giving a rating of  but i think it should be at least a  because the graphics are much better than the first two games making everything look more life like
i admit that some of the levels on this game especially towards the end scared me to death
i used to sit there with both eyes squinted scrwaming my head off as the sweat used to pour from my handspretty sad when you think about it now
despite this the levels are amazingly intricate and full of life and colour  much more detailed than any of the games in the series
since the game is set entirely in egypt you get a real feel to what life is like over there and almost become part of the game
this game took me nine months to complete december september  and i have to say that i enjoyed every second of it
lara has a variety of new features and you also have to go back and forth between levels to find a particular object that will open the door to the finale
the cutscenes that run through the entire game to tell the story are absolutely mindblowing
the graphics are brilliant  its just like watching a filmand laras boobs seem to get bigger as the series goes along
the last level truly is one of the greatest most spectacular levels in video gaming history which involves a confrontation with the god set
in the final cutscene of the game lara is seen exiting the crumbling tomb to find von croy at the entrance
emotion takes over and he puts out his hand but its too late
the tomb collapses with lara still inside
this really was a tense moment for tomb raider fanatics as they were left wondering if this was it for lara if there favourite compuiter game series was over for good
they need not have worried as tomb raider chronicles and lara croft tomb raider the angel of darkness followedoverall grade all in all tomb raider the last revelation is a musthave game for tomb raider fans and for anyone who enjoys computer games in general
but be warned this game requires a lot of time effort and determination
if you want to get everything right on the first time youre best off not buying this game because youll just hate it
yet for people who want an exciting suspenseful thrilling actionpacked blockbuster of a video game tomb raider the last revelation is the game for you
buy it now from amazontrlr is excellent
the story the graphics the gameplay  even the replay value  are top notchi was worried when i read that this tr would return to the first in that lara would primarily search  egyptianlike tombs and areas
i thought this meant the environments would  get old but they dont at all
the places lara explores are all related  but there are still tons of nice surprises like a level on a speeding  train without the zaniness of tr like area  and pitchblack london  skyscapes
gone are the incredibly hard unclear objectives of tr as  well as the stupid vehicle levelsthere are even new features to this  game  you can save more than one game on a card though it takes two  spots per game you can collect different types of ammo combine items  and use lasersight addon and binocularflashlight itemsthis game  definitely deserves a look
if youre a fan of the series but it right  away and you wont be disappointed
if youre new to them rent it or buy  it even anywaythis is a great and very very hard game but i beat it in one year
it as cool levels like the city of the dead and one big tomb
you go out and buy the game to know what i am talking aboutyou get to have all types of guns and so onthe weapons arecrossbowrevolvershotgunuzisand combine accessoriesexplore tombs as a teenage lara croftdiscovering her roots as an adventurerthe levels are longer and biger than before and any other tomb raider game that i play before
good luck on the game you are going to need it
have funthis just came out for the playstation network and i purchased it and played it for the first time
im really blown away at just how beautiful it is
the scale of these levels is massive
this is much different from the current tomb raider games
there are tons of places to explore
you can almost get almost get lost
but its also easier than the tomb raider games that came before it
there is less switch pulling or block pushing which is fine by me
this is probably my second or third favorite tomb raider game for the playstation i actually bought the combo pack for the ps but decided to purchase the original for playstation  still a classic in my eyesthis game is a very cool game made specifically for adults and older teenagers
some complain of its challenges but its an adult game and the challenge is needed
being that i can blow through ffviii without an ounce of trouble its refreshing to see a game with a significant amount of challenge
now onto the technical aspects
the graphics are some of the best i have ever seen
the seamless blend of fmv and character graphics adds the all important atmosphere quotient to a game
the blade runner style environments of the first disc are a refreshing change from the cutesy perky environments of other recent games
from there the game buries deep into depravity going to places i have never gone in games that makes it worth the price by itself
the only trouble i have with the game is the incredibly long load times after you die
they are an extraordinary annoyance but after getting back into the game it just doesnt matter and the endings are great too
just an innovative atmospheric plot driven game made for adults
ive been looking for one of these for a long timei played this game years ago on the playstation console and absolutely loved it
now i have a ps and bought fear effect after all this time i have no regrets
the storyline is well plotted and the game play is challenging smooth entertaining and makes you think therefore this game is not for the weak minded impatient gamer
the fear meter is a much welcomed attribute which adds a bit of reality and challenge as opposed to the traditional health bar and the ability to play with  different characters throughout the plot makes it a fascinating journeyi label fear effect as a game only a true gamer can appreciate so if you are all about quick play easy gaming and have little ability or desire to use a bit of brain power then this game is not for you but if youre up for challenges are patient and possess appreciation for this type of experience then its definitely a good buyfear effect is a prime example of the survival horror genre
at the same time it provides an atmosphere and storyline which is a huge change from the sometimes stoic resident evil which is rare
resident evil set the standard and while fear effect doesnt transcend it it provides changethe first most striking thing about fear effect is its odd graphical style
the characters are done in an anime style but the backgrounds are done in a realistic style and they also have streaming animations from the cd for things like fans and beeping lights
it is just really weird
i kind of like it
after awhile like most games you stop noticing
even if you dont like the graphics it is still worth playing
dont let the graphics deter youthe gameplay and combat in fear effect is great
the controls are somewhat awkward and annoying like resident evil though combat rolls  degree turns and autoaim help them out and the set camera angles occasionally get in the way of the action but other than that the fighting is nearly perfect
for one thing the fear meter is awesome
many people complain about it but i think it works well
for the most part it is just a health meter but things which increase your fear make you closer to dying as much as getting shot like being spotted by enemies or running low on ammo
if you can sneak up behind enemies and snap their necks which is cool or find more ammo or even just do well in fights you become less fearful
most peoples problem with it is that fear effect moves the meter straight to red one shot death before certain boss fights and other bad situations
that is kind of lame but it makes sense that you would about have a heart attack when you see a giant guy with a minigun
it is a fear meter after all
by the way the boss fights and enemies in the game are superfear effects storyline is great
it is very well put together and just plain cool
it is one of a very few games that has an original storyline
some of the stuff that happens  is awesome
some of the places and events and situations induce shivers
the bleak future setting behind it all is nice too
the three main characters hana glas and deke are nifty
they are kind of original too
the voice acting is pretty good which is a nice change from most games and the cutscenes are greatthe main problem with fear effect is its incredible difficulty
the actual combat itself is hard whereas in most survival horror games the difficulty just comes from ammo and healing item management
the puzzles are also pretty tough which is rare
it is also worth noting that the load times are terrible which detracts a little from the game but is compounded by the difficulty
fear effect is so hard that you need to restart often so you have to load your game often which makes for some fairly heavy waiting timefear effect is a must play game especially if youve enjoyed other games from the survival horror genre
fear effect is worth it for the experience
youve got to play it to the end despite its problems
i would suggest it to almost anyone unless you had a violent reaction to playing resident evil
it only has about ten hours of actual gameplay but it seems much larger due to how many times you must reload your game
pick fear effect up
youll probably like itthis not only the most unique blend of graphics i have ever seen but the graphics are some of the best i have seen on the playstation period
mixing anime characters that walk around in realtime environments is excellent
but these surroundings arent just any realtime they are actually cg quality running environments
so what you actually have is an anime designed character with facial expressions exploring in a cg environment
now that the basics have been stated lets talk about the special effects
what a scifi adventure title like this needs is some kick ass looking effects luckily kronos knows that as well
the job they did not only with the basic visuals but with the special effects is wonderful explosions look great
infact if you ask me things like fire explosions lighting and all of the other effects seem as if they had a lot of time put into them just to make them look believable
if you are interested in knowing the process of how the backgrounds were generated here it is kronos started out with super detailed d sketches then they render them into d and under lowresolution
later final touches are made and then they are set to run under hires for the final version the game
before i leave of to the gameplay i want to mention a quick thing for those who care fear effect has over  backgrounds and im guessing that that is the most any game has hadalthough the gameplay may feel like quotbeen there shot thatquot but fear effects gameplay is really a breath of fresh air
the camera flow is a lot like resident evils and dino crisis the gameplay in general is as well
though it may not be shooting zombies or skeletons the navigation is pretty close to the re series
you start out as hana at the beginning of the game you make your way through roofs and such until some story twisting events occur you are later forced to play as glas hanas partner you now have to get hana out of a few sticky situations
along both of their journeys you face bosses and pretty mindless enemies
which now leads me to another topic in the gameplay the ai in fe is pretty stupid
you can shoot pass them and they wont suspect a thing
compared to ai from syphon filter and metal gear solid fes ai hasnt even graduated preschool yet
although when they spot you they will fire at you with excellent accuracy
the plot in my mind is pretty inimitable although you may have seen a plot like this before it is really the setting that makes me say this
i wouldnt want to ruin the story for anyone so im deciding not to describe it for you but i will describe the setting
you are in hongkong the year is pretty far from now and the atmosphere of the game is scifi hence all of the dramatic sequences special effects you will encounter in the gamelike capcoms re series there are puzzles to be solved in this game as well
some can be so challenging that you will be forced to use a cheat or guide
fe is a pretty squeamish game tons and tons of blood is squirted all over the place
besides all of that you have a variety of weapons to choose from uzis  pistols machine guns hand guns and more
the game spans  cds but most of the space is used for the graphics quality and the gameplay is hurt by a short replay valueall of a sudden we see so many games with voice acting spawning out everywhere
i wont mention many but some of the few are tomba  alundra and syphon filter  it look as if this phase is being recognized by developers and is now being used in other games as well
fe sports some topnotch voice acting there isnt a slight show of breakup and the voices manage to keep up and they dont stray so late timing is not an issue
sound effect that come from say the gunshots are quite good you can hear everything from the gunshot to the wasted bullet falling to the ground
the sounds of the environments are great too looks like kronos put some time into the sound effects as wellthe control is very similar to resident evils
you have to hold the up button and move using the right and left buttons
since games with this type of control scheme dont come too often i had a hard time adjusting to the movement and layout of the control but you re freaks should get acquainted in no time
it took me a good half hour to get used to the controls fully but once that task is done all is finefear effect is eidos best creation so far the only game that can compare visually is final fantasy  the gameplay like i said is a definite quotbreath of fresh airquot a suspenseful thrilling unique game that will grab hold of you and never let go
every second of fear effect must be savored because the game doesnt last as long as current games do today
give it a week or so and youll be done
but still nothing should stop you from purchasing fear effect  this game has everything
great dialogue and speech unlike final fantasy hard and taxing puzzles unlike resident evil hard and challenging bosses again unlike resident evil and an amazing complex adult storyline
this is more like a movie
the twists of the story i wont give them away are great and it is one of few playstation games that offers a good challenge
it is resident evil style but res evil is much too easy and the dialogue in the cut scene is bad
in fear effect the cross between fmv and active play is created well and there is no significant change in graphics
it is a great game long  discs challenging with both puzzles and bosses and packed with action
if you liked res evil buy thisin the rpg genre its very difficult to be original
most of the time rpgs are just variations of concepts that can be found in almost every other genre
of course some manage to be original in some way like the final fantasy series the grandia games and the heatedly debated legend of dragoon
but probably one of the most original games found in the rpg market at least in the us is atlus thousand arms
a game that differs in practically every way thousand arms is an rpg gamers dream come truethe first sign that thousand arms is unique can be found in the story
you play meis the son of a famous spirit blacksmith who is trying to find his place in the world  and food in his stomach  after he lost his noble status when his village was attacked by the dark acolytes
unlike most noble heros in rpgs meis is a playboy and womanizer and charms or attemtps to charm practically every woman he sees
he eventually meets sodina sister of a famous spirit blacksmith and from here the story really starts moving
of course theres the usual megalomaniac trying to rule the world and all that but hey its an rpg
some things are bound to stay the same but this game has enough variety to help it stand out in the crowdthe uniqueness crosses over into the gameplay
the battle system is definately different from other rpgs
instead of all characters battling all foes at once only one character fights an enemy one at a time in the frontline while other characters remain in the back line
but the back characters do serve a purpose they can use items defensive magic or go on standby where they can taunt the enemy or cheer the frontline character both of which can cause certain status effects
while it sounds mundane this battle system is a very refreshing changebut the best part of the gameplay has to be what has rarely been seen in the us the dating sim
the lead character meis can actually take certain girls on dates where the girls asks meis questions and depending upon the answer he selects her intimacy toward him changes
and this isnt without a reason
a high intimacy level with a girl can let meis forge stronger weapons with powerful spells so the dating aspect of the game isnt only interesting its necessary
of course its important to raise a girls imtimacy level but its also fun to choose the wrong answers in the dating questions just to see the girls reactions
while not a fullfledged dating sim its still a lot of fun and its a pity this game didnt pave the way for dating sims like tokimeki memorial and sentimental graffiti to come to the usgraphically thousand arms has standard yet amazing psxgraphics
unlike the psx final fantasy games environments arent prerendered backgrounds but a living breathing world somewhat like the one seen in ffx
but the game still manages to look different because of its animestyle characters
the fmv cutscenes feel like a wacky anime series and the excellent opening seems to only solidify this feeling
characters in the main screen are sprites but in battle they become fully realized characters albeit somewhat flat onessoundwise this game earns top marks in most areas
atlus made a very good conscious decision to leave in the original japanese opening and ending
and the game features over  hours of spoken dialogue most of which is in the dating part of the game
the voice acting can sound a little forced sometimes but overall it sounds very well done
the only thing that probably falls flat in the sound department is the background music
while not terrible theres nothing really catchy or noteworthy and the battle theme does sound a little out of placeall in all thousand arms is a fantastic rpg and should be seriously considered by any serious rpg fan
while games like the final fantasy series and chrono cross are landmarks in the genre thousand arms tries to bring a breath of fresh air into the rpg market and it succeeds on virtually every level
nothing can compare to this game because its just too uniquepart dating sim part rpg and a whole lot of fun
players assume the role of meis a womanizing hero who needs to woo ladies in order to strengthen his weapons
this game is fully voice acted which was pretty remarkable at the time of release
a hilarious and charming story that any rpg fan should trythis game is awesome it is one of the best games i have ever playedyou are a gang member who has to kill and steal to liveyou work for gangs and if you dont want to work kill people for fun and the cops will be on your tail
you can arm your car with machine guns and bombsgta  is one of the funnest psx titlesthe game takes place in a city that is about to collapse
gang wars riots drugs and crime are striking at the citys heart
law and order are steadily declining and citizens fear for their livesgameplaythe birdview camera is an interesting ideain some respects it works so wellin others though it is toughthe way you walk is strange but cool as wellto walk forwards press x to walk backwards press square
same with vehicleswhile on foot press o to burp or fartwhile in a car press o to honk the horn
you can hijack cars and buy upgrades for your carsfinding weapons and killing civilians is an awesome addition to any gamegraphicsby todays standards these are horribleat the time though they were pretty decent
they are well enough though to navigate through the  vast distrctssoundcarsgunsand radio sounds are awesome
voice sounds are annoyingall in all this is a great title for the psxin every way this is better than the first two games
grand theft auto always felt dated while the london addon was a little quirky and annoying
this game fixes all of those flaws and makes gta  one of the best ps one games ever to be realeased
there are plenty of new cars and weapons and the game is faster
the camera no longer zooms in and out when you drive fast so the game is a lot better to look at
the graphics are much better but there is still room for improvement
if you only get to play one grand theft auto game on ps one make it gta  this game is awesomewhen i first heard of this game i thought to myself hey this game is not any good
dont buy it
good god was i ever wrong
this game has provided many coutless hours of entertainment
the graphics are a little shoddy but who cares
buy it todaygta  is the last game to have the overhead veiw but it has the most weapons and best playing style of the originals would definitely recommend for gta fansthis game is awesome
you play as a gang member for any gang you chose
you complete missions to earn money for your gang and can be in wars with cops other gangs and the army
although the graphics may be badit completely makes up for it in gameplay
this game offers a wide variety of weaponsincluding rocket launchers machine guns car bombsand tazers cars and missions
it is very fun to play and has very high levels of replayablity
everthing is always new
buy this gameyou wont be dissapointedgta  has always stood out to me from all the other gta games
this game has a bird eye view and the controls are a bit different but something about it just stands out from the games that came out later in the series and it stands out in all the right waysit is fun and never gets oldgrand theft auto  is good
the graphics are nothing special but the fun factor makes up for that
gta is highly addictive and i sat there playing it for hours
the people are tacky looking but the graphics for the vehicles are good
also there is an array of weapons that are fun to use especially if you have the cheat
i rented it and got to the second level in a few days
the levels are long and hard though
sometimes the arrows that guide you get confusing and there is no map during gameplay
the reason i gave it five stars is because the game it self is really really fun if you can get over the graphics
as i said before it is addictive and you have to sacrafice alot of time to beat the game with all of the kill frenzies gta points ect
complete
i recommend that you should first rent it to see if you like it and if you do then buy it
but if you dont like this check out driver great selection of old school pre own games even thought psone is long gone and games are not mass produce anymore but i was able to locate great games x faster and cheaper than any other place satisfaction guaranteei am a ps user but bought this gem back when i had a ps
the game is exceptionally hard in one player mode as you have two charcters who you have to toggle between
the game is both strategic and action oriented
you can blast the enemy with your machine gunner or use the sniper to pick them off from a distance
the game takes some effort to learn but is well worth it
one of the nice features on two player is that if your partner dies the screen becomes fullscreen for the remaining player
great game for one or two playersi bought blood omenlegacy of kain almost immediately after its release
it was good although it suffered from many flaws which at the time were acceptable
when i heard of the premise of soul reaver i thought quotgreat
now kain is going the route of tomb raider
ho humquotneedless to say i was quite pleased with the final product of soul reaver
no it isnt the same as blood omen but it is highly enjoyable on its own merit
my only complaint was the lack of fluidity of the controls but this is a minor annoyance at most
i would recommend this game to anyone period
you wont be disappointednow you follow the exploits of raziel as he attempts to exact revenge on his creator and betrayer the vile kain
the voices are great particularly that of the sneering kain and the constant gameplay is fantastic
the idea of gaining new abilities as one devours souls is pretty freakin cool toohowever can somebody tell me why eidos cant put these games out on time
i waited a long time for soul reaver and now i am waiting for soul reaver  yeah the games are good but how about making your deadlinethe games first cinematic sequence shows why kain casts youraziel into the vortex of the dead
the reason he does so is because you grew your wings before him
as he circles you you are suddenly drenched in pain as kain rips your wings
as you lay there wounded he orders your vampire brethern to toss you into the abyss
after an eternity of pain and suffering you finally hit the bottom of the abyssa voice suddenly summons youhe tells you he can help you get vengance on kain
you tell him you dont deserve this fate and he replies by telling you that you have no choice
you find the cape that marked you as clan leader and cover up your face to hide the fact that your jaw has disintergrated off your faceyou reluctantly agree to his offer to helpyou soon discover that instead of blood you hunger fo soulsprosnice lengthhrsresponsive controlsno ingame loadingfantastic storylinechallenging puzzlespulls out emotions that you normally dont feel in games
like remorsefighting controlsgaining ablities by killing your enemiesconssometimes puzzles are harder than neccesarythat is all i can tell you without ruining anything
just try the game and youll be sure to love itprobably the most impressive ps game ive seen
a must have in a gamers collection
this game is a work of artkain has opted not to sacrifice himself and there are forces out there that would have you believe that this once noble knight was now a selfish and aarogant tyrant and while this seems true if theres one thing we learned from blood omen things are not as they appear or more years after blood omen kain has been exaulted to the status of a god
he has raised up an army of vampires lead by his first quotbornquot lt raziel and lashed out at the humanity that had attempted to erradicate the vampires under the leadership of mobieusevery so often a vampire enters a state of change and evolves
raziel sprouted bat like wings and in what seemed like a jealous rage kain tore the wings from his back and ordered raziel to be executed
but that is only beginning
centuries later raziel awakens battered torn and not even a shadow of his former glory
a mysterious entity calls to him and orders him to exact his revenge on kain
the story is pretty straight forward compared to blood omen and soul reavor  its still a story of epic proportions but not as good as its prequel and sequel
still its integral to the over all story
if you havent played it yet shame on you but get the dreamcast or pc versionthis game was freakin sweet it is alot of fun
i recomend it to everyone i thought that the original legacy of kain was great
when the sequel came out i couldnt wait
this game has more atmosphere than anything ive seen
from beginning to end i was immersed in a dark horrific  landscape complete with disturbing visuals and haunting sounds coming from  everywhere and nowhere
the sequel improved immensely upon the original  with a much more fluid landscape and virtually no loading time
graphics  were amazing and the cut scenes could have been put together to make an  animated short
my only complaint is that the end made me so anxious for a  sequel but that just tells you how great of a game this isthe beginning of a great franchise
the kain games weregre at and the soul reaver games might have been even betterthese games are awesome
do yourself a favor and buy the whole seriesfor starters you get a veriety of wepons such as a spear  torchbodersmy personel faverite the soel reaver it self you all so learn severeal tecnics like how to swim and climb walls throwing enimy on spikes is fun tothis is a great game for all people who love dark games and vampires and enjoy action games
soul reaver is full of puzzles to solve and enemys to kill
its great fun and it isnt to hard that will be throwing your controller at the tv
its fun and action packed and it will make you want to purchase the other legacy of kain games to get the whole storyless then a week to beathaving played and thoroughly enjoyed blood omen legacy of kain i remember running off after work to pick this up the day it hit store shelvesi was not disappointedcombining an intense and intriguing story with at that time topoftheline graphics and a datastreaming technique that allowed the game to move seamlessly without noticeable loading times or the annoying interruption of transitional loading screens between rooms or levelsthe only negatives to this game are the frequency of the block puzzles and a couple of minor technical glitches but in this game they are comparatively trivial when weighted out against the drama atmosphere and overall depth of the gamesoul reaver is fantastic but only if youre the right type of gamer
if you enjoy the dramatic this ones for you
if goofy is your thing dont bothersr boasts great graphics and equally great story excellently interlaced cut scenes and voice overs satisfying achievment levels and absolutely wicked atmosphere
in fact you might say it simply ooozes atmosphere
dark ominousvengful atmospherethe only con of sr is its almost total adbandonment of classic big boss  kicking
as most major opponents are invulnerable the player must dicover his foes weakness
that and several puzzle type situations that must be solved in order to progress may drive the player temporarily insane but the games drama content more than makes up for ita word about the ending its a little dissapointing
the rising drama towards the climax of the game is exceptional but the whole thing ends in a to be continued fashion
rather disheartening after so much fantastic gameplayeven so this one is awesome
now raziel crawl up from the underworld consume the souls of your brothers who cursed you and the former master who cast you into the pit so long agothis is one of me favorite games of all timethe scenery and atmosphere in this game are blissfully melencholic and the musical soundtrack to the game brings all that darkness to life
abandon all this sorrow and crumble into an even deeper misery as you enter the spectral realm
consume the souls of the dead and wish you could stay here foreverthis is the type of game you could just live withinawesome storyline scereney also very expensive game for a just a old  sony playation game and tons  of levels and great graphics i stil am   completed with the game the action intensity could be a little bit better thoughthis is one of the best psplaystation games
right along with games like quotfinall fantasy quot
better than the quottomb raiderquot gamesalso from eidos
allthough it has some flawsas every game does  it still is a very fun and very good game
it has good graphics  and voice acting  good music tooyou play razielif you read the editorial review you know all this once a luitenantnot as in army rank  but kainda like right hand man sorta second in command to kain  the vampire ruler along with  others
however raziel than evolved and grew wings before kain
kain became jealois and furious and tore raziels wings  than through him into the lake  to be damned and burn for eternitywater burns them
but then a spirit or something called the elder saves and ressurects raziel to take revenge on kainthere are two realms or worlds or planes  the spectre plane and the material plane
the material realm is just the normal world  the spectre realm is a twisted version of the material realmof course its the underworldnetherworld death place thingyou can switch between these realms whenever you wish  this can be a big help as that might not be reachible in the material realm might be in the twisted spectre plane or visa versathere are alot of enamys to fightalot more than in tomb raider wich seems like a walk in the park compared to this and you need to fight enamys atleast untill you get the soul reaver because in the material realm your energyhealth slowly runs out  and you need to consume the souls of your enamys
the fighting works like this first you attack your enamys with normal attackssquare button untill they are stunned than before they recover you must attack them with a fatal blowtriangle button they than die and there soulslook like balls of blue light or mini comets floating around leave there bodys  you can then consume the souls before they go into the spectral realmwere they will be if you go there
you have a large collection of weapons with wich to do this
your bare hands or clawsyou first slash them than pick them up and through them into fire or water sunlight or onto spikes on walls
you can burn them with torches impale them on spear or you have your ultiment weapon the soul reaverbasicly a sword of spiritual energy that you hit enamys with
you also have magic powers or glyphs these include powers like the shift glyphyou start out with this it allows you to go between material and spetre  or stone or sunlight
there are alot of puzzles to figure out however they can be chalengingand get repetitive
the problems are some times awkward camera angles  often time no sense of direction puzzles can be chalengingyou will find yourself wandering about wondering what to do very oftenthough that is not a magor flaw the soul reaver turns off if you get only slightly hurt
but aside from those flaws its a great game dont listen to the negative reviews  all i have told you is what the game really is like  so order this game or go out and buy it you wont be sorryclassic ps game with many good game stats rated in wiki and many other sites played it had to have it
came as describedrainbow  has it all
this is for any level of players
it features  training missions  unique missions plus eagle watch missions and speacial forces action
rainbow  is very similar to the halflife game
it pumps you up and makes your heart beats faster as if you are the player itself
if you failed one mission and have to repeat again the enemies are not where you think you were last kill
it shifts around and there are no two same missions alike
if you are into first player action type game you have got to pick this up
you will be playing this everyday for at least a monthrainbow six is one amazing game
you just what the us army is doing right now in afghanistan
you are with an antiterrorist group which tries to stop terrorists from bombing buildings and other terrorist actsyou and your group do drills to train for your missions
the only bad part is the missions and choosing all of your stuff takes a long timea very long timeafter you have all of your weapons and materials you go on over  different missions
you kill terrorists and try to save hostages by getting past the terrorists guarding them who will shoot you right when they see you which causes a problem
it is nearly impossible to save the hostageson your missions you also go to certian areas and get ready to make your attack on the enemies
then its time to attack with your sweet guns
this game is a great shooting simulator that will attract many people who enjoy hunting or shooting with gunsthis game is almost too realistic which isnt all that bad but bad when it comes to you getting killed all the time when you go on certain missionsif you are looking for some fun with your dreamcastthis is the game to getin this game you take on the life of a boy whos grandfather died leaving his farm unattended
deciding he wants to take it over for his grandfather you control him through his everyday activities
including managing crops tending to cattle shiping items for money working on getting a wife and dealing with odd funny or sad situations in your everyday life
if you like anime rpgs or just want a game youll never get tired of this one is for youthis is undoubtedly the best harvest moon game to date and one of if not the best nintendo  gamesits an underrated classic a cult classic
i highly recommend it
its fun and realisticbeware though like all harvest moon games this is addicting
its a farming life simyou can court girls go to festivals and do a variety of thingsharvest moon  is very much like animal crossing which came out two years later
its a youeitherloveitoryoudont game
the game reeks of repetition but it just has that charm that keeps certain people coming at it over and over
i suppose what really determines which of the two aforementioned categories is how good you are at it
i mean if you really suck at it like me you would spend all day trying to water your plants and have no time with any interaction which is the true heart and soul behind this game
sure growing crops raising animals and foraging are important but if thats all you do youre not experiencing this game to its fullestharvest moon  was perhaps the nintendo  game with the largest amount of possible character interaction until nintendo released animal forest in late  there are counts gives up over  people in that little town and you can speak to all of them
some of the people are not very fun to talk to but others provide you with some hearty conversations and longlasting friendships especially the five available ladies
oh yeah
my favorites are anne and elli
ahemalthough harvest moon  has that dating sim aspect the actual process of winning their hearts is a bit confusing
perhaps i just dont understand it
other activities fill the year such as festivals and horsedog races
they break the monotony and offer some welcomed changes to the gameplay
of course you can add to the monotony during the races by spending time betting max coins for each entry but i guess thats your choice
the gameplay here is pretty openended
its just that the days pass so fast
even though your character looks like he should be in middle school it is possible for you to start a family
its too bad your son will always stay a mooch
while the monotonous gameplay would seem soporific give it a try anyways
if youre good then youd most likely enjoy this game
not only that it would also be fun to watch
thats right
it is in fact fun to watch somebody that is goodthe graphics are nothing special
the entire game is played from a topdown perspective and your characters movement is a bitodd to say the least
because the action is seen from the angle moving in diagnals is the way to go
the character models are actually not that bad
they have this cute beadyeyed look that is quite adorable
the music is very nice but it is too short and as a result loops too often
some people faulted the game for talking only in text
but you know what
voice acting would have ruined it
oh yeah
this is probably the only n with the descriptor alcohol usei first picked up the game on a rainy day because i liked the cartoon characters on the front of it
it was a rental but the next day i begged my parents to take me out so i could buy itthis game was absolutely amazing and still is to this day
nothing can come close to that first experience in a new series so none of the newer harvest moon games hit exactly that same cord but i still mark this as one of the best games i have ever playedi loved the relationships i loved the characters the moody karen who worked on the vineyard ann or amy that worked on the rival farm the quiet girl the one i chose to marry who worked at the local library and was also the mayors daughter
and by the way the mayor is absolutely the most lovable character everi liked how there was always something to do the pacing was just right so time didnt pass too fast or too slow there was always new things happening around town festivals etc and no day was the same rain snow maybe there would be a tornado maybe someone would greet you at the front door and travel to the mountains with you etcthe closest game ive played is harvest moon tree of tranquility for wii for anyone whos interested but that one also has some faultsoverall if you havent played this you are definitely missing out and if you have played from this series before you should try this one because it is a different and great game on its own that still stands up to some of the freeroam do anything types of games that exist todaywhen i first heard of this game from my friend i had the ususal reaction a farming game
right soundsumgreat
not the first time i saw this game at my friends house my thoughts were along the lines of well its not as bad as it sounds but still its farming game for crying out loud
then i played it
from the first time that little guy ate his quick morning meal on that faithful spring rd i was hooked
it all started simple enoughmet the people cleared the farm i like itbought some crops planted explored i like it alotmet more people started the gift giving i like it a whole lotgot popuri to a blue heart i love this game
this is one of my favorite games of all time
i will soon be purchsing the sequal for ps harvest moon save the homeland which i have been longing for ever since i got my ps
yes i am writing this a long time after it was released i know
and after all this time it is still in my top  greatest games evernatsume you have given me the gift of gifts in this game and it will not soon be forgottenthis game is soooooooooooo awesome
it is one of the best games on the system
in this game you are a farmer but you can also get married and have a child
you have to be a guy farmer but its still fun even if youre a girl
this is a great game for anyonethis game is an absolute joy to play
the graphics may be very basic the sound is lackluster there are no control or setup options but it absolutely is one of the best games to come out this past holiday season
the premise is simple take over you departed grandfathers farm and turn it into a flourishing establishment and along the way woo one of several young local girls and make her your bride
with such a quirky and novel concept harvest moon is a breath of fresh air in the video game world and proves that there is plenty of unexplored territory out there for game producers
beyond the wonderful basic concept of the game there are plenty of hidden items that add to the obsesive feeling you will achieve playing this game
it becomes more than just a enjoyable experience it becomes an addiction
you will get as much joy from harvesting your crops as you will when your potential future bride begins returning your affection
might i add that this is a game that anyone can play and enjoy especially females who would not typically pick up a controler
i highly recommend this gamei had been looking for this game for a while and it is a very fun gameharvest moon  is one of the best game i owned
its good story line and gameplayer is one main reasons
you earn money and do alot of other stuff
like mine fish bluid stuff find treasure go to the dog races bluid add ons to your houselike a deck or green house and lots of other
so do yourself a favor and buy this gamenot all strategy games are blood and gore unsuitable for youngsters
harvest moon does require some strategic thinking but is great for tykes  that need something low key and nonviolent to playthe premise is a  sad one  you are an orphan boy which must take over your grandfathers  farm
you have a pet dog but thats it  everything else is up to you
off  to workyou must determine how best to keep your farm running
should  you plant eggplant or potatoes
spend your time fishing or milking cows
the better you do the more you earn and the more seeds you can buy or  chickens you can raiseits not all work
there are festivals to attend  and pretty girls to talk to
you can upgrade your home with a second floor  or with a cradle
choose a girl to marry and maybe your house will become  a happy home with a growing family
your chickens cows and even horse  will share in the funseasons go by rain comes and goes your skills  improve and you might even win a horserace
even those too young to grasp  the strategy involved will still enjoy watching the plants grow and riding  the horse aroundnot exactly a mind boggling challenge but for the  younger set its a fun rompi know that it seems unlikely that a game about farming would be fun
but harvest moon  is the most addictively entertaining game i have ever played and i dont usually like rpgsyou play a young man whose grandfather has died and left him his rundown farm to revive
there are tons of chores to do animals to raise vegetables to harvest people to visit girls to marry spring festivals horse races swimming contests and much much more
theres always money to make and things to buy that can improve your house farm or love lifeafter  years the mans parents come to rate how hes done depending on how well the farm is doing
there are  seasons each consisting of  days
there are  days in a harvest moon year and around  minutes in each day
as the seasons change the events vegetables scenery and peoples dialogues change as well
there are new events every yearone thing that is pretty amazing is that this game is entirely free of violence blood or action yet its fun for all ages
its good for kids because it is peaceful and nonviolent and makes them use strategy and helps them calculate time
its good for older people too because it is challenging and there are many surprises to keep you coming back for more
this game has a very high replay value because each time you play it it is completely different you can marry  different girls and depending on which one you persue the game changes a lot
the absense of action amp fighting makes it easier to concentrate on strategy
the graphics arent great but personally i dont mind the animals and people are really cute and chunky and the controls are easy to masteri would recommend harvest moon  to people of all ages
its addictive challenging and it makes something that looks pretty dull into a really really fun gameharvest moon to me like many others is a good game for many reasons other than gameplay
the feeling of complete freedom is such a rare expierience in the realm of video games
and the idea of having another life a dgital one is crisp like always
but what is it specifically that satisfies me about this game
there is always alot to do
somewhere between training your horse cleaning weeding and sowing your garden during the spring fall and summer and mining and collecting wood during the winter
helping build a spa finding a bride and having a child im sure youll find something to occupy yourself with
also the game provieds an air of nostalgia and a feeling of warmth and community no other game provides
in my honest opinion this game is worth every second of searching it will take you to find it and every penny youll spend
this is an awesome game
if youd like to email me do it at emailthanks
and i hope this review helpsone of the best games ive ever played
even through many years of gaming experience this is on my top ten list
you run your own farm and face many suprises and challenges a real farmer might deal with
this game has no violence of any kind and is fun for even younger children just beginning their gaming careers
not just this game but the whole harvest moon series is worth your buyharvest moon  is one of my favorite video games
i was a little late on playing it but hey better late than never
being someone that is a sucker for nostalgia and sentimental feelings this game was good for mei will start out pointing out the weaknesses
the graphics are weak  even for the time it came out
but honestly
i prefer this over the modern and oh so cute new animation
also for someone who is experienced with harvest moon this game can end up being very easy
especially near the end of the second and third year
being someone who grew up playing friends of mineral town i mastered this game
for my last complaint the controls can be annoying
just wait to you try to ship all of your cropsgoing back in and out of your bagas for the positives there are a lot
the majority of the characters in this game are actually fleshed out
i feel like the cutscenes and heart events were not written for children
it is actually interesting and heartwarming something i miss about harvest moon nowadays
the festivals are interesting and fun something to look forward to all throughout the monthsthe farming system
perfection
so simple and easy to understand
i absolutely adore the greenhouse you can purchase and i love the fast past feel
you can accomplish little things around the farm each day little by little
thats the way i like itin conclusion i adore this game
it works as a perfect introduction for the series
the characters and town have really stayed with me
touching and beautifuli feel like this game deserves a  star classic rating
if it could be made and updated for a portable player i would be one happy girli barely play my gameboy anymore due to lack of games this good
i have played so many hours of this its been such a fun thing to do busy on trips and stuff
anyway i dont need to review it it rules
buy this and the pokemon games the rpgs not the other stuffi went on a trip to florida about a year and a half ago and bought this at a used video game shop
this game was so fun i could not put it down
i even sat inside the condo all day and played this while everyone else was at the beach
you can choose to be a boy or girl and you keep a farm
each season there are new crops to plant and you can also have cows and chickens which also help youmake a prophit
thsi game deserves  stars as this is one of the best games i have ever bought for gbc next to pokemonwhen harvest moon was first released not many people thought that a game about farming would not sell well because it would seem quotboringquot
surprise surprise because harvest moon was praised everywhere by sim fans that enjoyed the toils of everyday life
think the sims ten years ago
anyways harvest moon is a great game in which you must farm and ranch and dig your way to more money crops animals and healthhappiness in order to appease the ghost of the previous owner
i dont really know exactly who to reccommend this to
this is great for a simulation fan but little kids might become bored so id recommend this to anyone above the age of ten who has hours to spend on this great adventuremy grandma plays this game for hours at a time
gotta get the little man to the bottom
if you enjoy blood boiling puzzle youll like iti have loved playing tetris ever since the classic nes and have had various handheld versions since they came out i have even downloaded a version to my cel phone
i have pretty much given up on trying to keep up with new consoles ive had my playstation for about  years and still break this game out once a week
my husband and i play headtohead in the classic mode which is really what i bought it for
once in a while i will give the puzzle mode a go but mostly stick with the classic
if it aint broke dont fix itmy wife loves this game i bought it for her for christmas
she loves it becuse she like the one from the older games she playedwell almost
the developers added a few new twists the most interesting of which is the puzzle mode
each puzzle level begins with the professor standing on a different pattern of blocks
youve got to clear the blocks out from under him to get him to the bottom
if you dont figure out the right way to solve this puzzle he climbs to the top of the blocks youre stacking up
the games over when the professor and the descending spiked ceiling collide
this version of the game is entertaining and even challenging although after a while you begin to wonder why youre trying to rescue a guy who insists on climbing to his death
other new additions include an edit mode that lets you create and save your own puzzles
a splitscreen mode enables two people to play tetris at the same time without competing against one another
in the regular vs mode you can still play the computer or a friend
as with most new puzzle games you can send blocks to your opponents screen when you clear a certain amount from your own  in this case two rows of blocks cleared from your screen means two rows of blocks sent to your opponent
if you like tetris and youre looking for a familiar addictive game this is the answer
tetris plus hasnt revolutionized puzzle games but its still funwow
theres lots more to this than meets the eye
it takes you through different time periods each one giving you new territories to explore
i enjoyed it and the price is right
used a walkthrough but also found a lot on my own toif you cant play it there is help
this is an update
i found the patch
its not perfect but a little working at it should get the game to play
if you want the patch to play amber and you cant find it online leave a comment here and i will send it via emaili bought this game when it was brand new on a windows  computer
it is a very adored game by me and i love it to bits
but now i cant play it
if i were wealthy i would gladly purchase a windows  computer just to play this game again
just a little bit spooky with engaging puzzles and delightful plots and mysteriesbut it doesnt play on xp
i have heard tell of a patch and am desperate to try itagain the game is amazingif you can play itit funny and great to play
help gex to save the world again
but new levels that you have not gone to
i did and i love it
every  seconds he says something funny
each level he can wear suits like a outfit or something like that
what he wear is so cutehe always say something crazy and so on
hey buy this game trush me your face will turn red you know why
each level is very colorful so you can see better and so onin the game when you are about to start the level dont touch the buttons or anything ok he  may say something funny and listen very wellthis game is no other game that i playden before its better well almost
i wish they added more levels to the game so it will be more fun dont you think
thank you for reading this what do you think about itdo you like giant monsters
do you like destruction
do you like vent your anger amongst the world
this game is for you then
choose a monsters destroy a major continent and save your fellow monsters
monsters have special moves called rampage in which they do something that is specialized for them
 monsters and universal tour
are u ini would compare it to the rest of the mortal kombat games
i liked how it was fun but still tied into the rest of the mortal kombat video gamesokay sure
the graphics may be a little poor and the game play may be a little hard especially because this game is a sidescroller but this is still i would think the greatest mk ever
this game goes beyond the tournament and the story rules
mythologies goes back into the past before the orginal mortal kombat
as subzero you must find the symbols that represent the elements and defeat totally cool bosses
by far the best part of the game is the end level which takes you into the maze of quan chis fortress where you later meet up with him and the original shinnok
this mk game is a musthave for any mortal kombat fan who enjoys mks dark storylines more than the tournamet fightsthis classic platform fighting game takes a little time to get used to on the nintendo  controller but none the less a good game for its time periodthis was a really interesting game
if you like a character in particular you should try this game
it features subzero does interesting things
spend an hour on thisa classic video game of destruction
the goal is to simply defeat the other two opponents  this game is fun i forget if it is a  player game or notthis is a really fun game that i used to play when it first came out
i lost the copy that i had years ago so i bought it again to replay with friendsthe best one in the portable line of mortal kombat
most argue that the second one surpasses all well as unfortunate as it is i havent played it yet but when i do i will be sure to get a review up on it
thats neither here nor there so lets just finish this review on the third onegraphics the game definatly shines here but you cant tell the difference between sektor and cyrax at the fighter selection screen
the backgrounds are nicely done and the character models are top notchsound the weak point of the game indifferent sound effects but an almost identical score to the console versions of the game oh and thats a major complimentgameplay the best part of the game is its great playability perfect for onthego gameing
the special moves are somewhat hard to do if you dont know when to do it because youll get counterattacked real quick if you dont watch itin conclusion its a great game that if you havent already check it out you shouldi liked the game
it had the same control as other ps games
i would compare it to the other mortal kombat gamesits a very good game  you should buy it mk is a superior fighting game
my mouth is watering for mortal kombat deadly alliance
the ps version is a lil slower than the n version
however this game loses no points for that
greatmortal kombat its a cool fighting game i love doing scorpions spear into a throw or combo although subzeros ice can beat itthe good great graphics smooth controls gory and brutal fatalities well balancedthe bad weak roster awkward animations weapons still feel kind of uselessmortal kombat  was probably the most carefully watched game in the series due to abandoning the d root and going for d
no one knew what was going to happen to the series and a lot of fans lost hope thinking the silky smooth controls and excellent digitized graphics would go by the wayside in d
however the game featured excellent visuals for the time and the silky smooth controls stayed despite some slippery and awkward animations
the fourth game also introduced some new characters who i thought were some of the weakest in the series
so despite the weaker roster we got some pretty good fatalities and excellent stages to fight inthe new characters like kai jarek fujin a weak attempt at making another raiden and tanya were pretty bleh
they didnt have that impact that the classic characters did but some returned like scorpion and subzero sonya and johnny cage came back for the first time since mk
the run button and combos were carried over into d which were smooth as well as a first stab at moving in a d environment
you would hit a button to kind of strafe to the side to avoid attacks and this added a whole new level of strategy
weapons were introduced in free form now and every character had one
get hit though and you lose the weapon until you can pick it back upthe fatalities were extremely brutal and some of the best the series has seen and looked even better in d
this leads to a new level of detail and creativity that cant be done in d
this was also the slow departure from other alities and the series stuck with just fatalities
a new boss was introduced as shinnok and goro returned as the miniboss
the game carries over a lot of elements that make it still feel classic but then injects some new stuff as well
i really felt the game was well balanced and was exactly what the first mk in d should be
overall mk is a classic and did an amazing job of transferring over into d which was very difficult
this of course paved a path for all future mk games but we can always look back on mk as the childthere is no need to buy each game separately except after mortal kombat  this collection is slammed pack with all three and all the characters with old and new combos with quick death defying killer moves
a must have for you mortal kombat fanantics
great gamethis game is great
all three original mk games bundled into one plus more
it provides a great leadup to mk and bridges the gap between the old  bit mk games and the cd and dvd mk games of todayi liked the game
it was comparable to the original mortal kombat side scrolling fighting games
it still had the ps controlsmortal kombat trilogy was the game that put an end to the mk  storyline
every character from mk umk return
at this point earth  outworld are close to being merged
the elder gods refuse to get involved so the only hope is raiden he transforms into a mortal so he can survive in both relms
he leads the earth warriors into the final showdown
also johnny cage has resurrected
baraka is back just as millena promised
scorpion reptile  sindel have all turned on shao kahn  sub bosses have came back goro  kintaro
a wild card is a new fighter called chamelon
nooob saibot who was a hidden fighter in mk ii is playable he was playable in the gen  snes version of ultimate mortal kombat  but he wasnt in the arcade or saturn versions of ultimate mortal kombat  rain a ninja dressed in purple  his name is rain take a quick guess on that 
rain was originally fighting for shao kahn kitana helped him recall his past his father was an edian knight who died in the war against shao kahn
the whole idea was s of centuries  ago the mortal kombat tournament  was created by wisemen of the east who saw a forbidden land thats why it was created
shao kahn has tried  tried to use the tournament to weaken the dimensional gates
which ultimately raiden wants the fight to the death with shao kahn
which noob saibot sees this as the opportunity if shao kahn is killed noob saibot can get a fallen elder god out of the netherrelm
john tobias did the smart thing tied up everything  wrapped up the original storyline  left it open for a th installment
this is the most complete version of mortal kombat  it has everything  then some
all fatalities babalities animalities friendships  brutalities are intact all the areas are in it
you can even play as mk  raiden mk ii jax mk kung lao mk  kan they even have there original fatalities too
you get to play as all the bosses
they didnt get endings though except for shao kahn but not much of  mk trilogy got ported to the nintendo  ps  sega saturn
the  version is cr ap you can play as shao kahn  motaro but no goro or kintaro
chamelon is a female in the  version
shao kahn  motaro got fatalities in the  version though
i just never liked the  version it really never was made for fighting games im sorry its not
maybe if they had a good arcade stick maybe
saturn  playstation ports are identical saturn version costs more
also if you play this on the playstation  when you beat it you get a blank screen
i know the playstation version has a thing for  button combos  a cheat for  button fatalities
so ill be back to review mortal kombat all the favorites from mortal kombat ultimate mortal kombat  are all here
the graphics are fantastic theres a lotta cool codes thatre very useful and that makes the game a little easier and the fights are more fun than they ever were to play
and all of the bosses are for the first time ever playable characters
so if you wanted to play as shao kahn motaro kintaro or goro you finally get your wish with this incredible game
and theres secret codes you can enter thatll enable you to perform fatalities with just  button theres a code to play as chameleon theres a code that enables old mk  and mk  characters like the mk  raiden the old mk  kato and the old mk  kung lao
this is the ultimate mortal kombat game and this is the greatest mk game ever made
after this and mortal kombat  the mk games would never be good againi did not own this game for playstation i owned it for pc
but they are exactly the sameafter an upgrade past windows  this game never would work on my pc again
but i have thought about getting the playstaion for this game or a rom shhhhthis game combined mortal kombats    and another version i forget the name into the one game
and that was a great move
finally all the charactors where playable in the one game even hidden charactors where findable like a cool charactor named chameleon who was a ninja but kept changing hed morph into scorpion sub zero reptile rain ectall the charactors where there
but not all the backgrounds where a few where missing
what made this game the best was turning on one button fatality isntead of memorising thousand step codes that wouldnt always work
yous just go to the options menu and hold up and the block buttons or something and it would let you access a secret option menu where you could select the cool cheats
one button fatalitys was the best you could press one button when it said finish to do the finisher   freind shipm animality ect this is still my favorite mk game
i have rated it here because the n version sucked and was not a trilogy it was mk with a few extra charactorsoh my god dont get me started on this game oh how ive played this so i was ten and playing this game some times accidentally doing  a fatality or babality oh how i was so anoying i repeated the same move over and over i beat this game in warrior with subzero so sooo somanytimes i hate mk for and the armagedon series the combo threads were more complicated i was so tortured by learning how to do the combos and searching for stuff and you could only do  combos mk vs dc the combo breakers were the rage bars which are hard to fill they chould of bean seperated or not limitted and with good reason when some characters like flash get started on a combo thread they dont stop then youl be waisting a bar for rage it should be three chances for combo breakers who ever gets rage first weapon impale and rage meter from mk that shows a shadow and cheats to do specials in air bombs bursting every where and scorpions still there doing custum combos for victory and justice for aaaalllove the game
just replaced it w an old one that i had
to many scraches on the old one
just love it so much i will replace it again once the new one is worn outfinally getting around to reviewing this game
mk trilogy is a great mortal kombat game
the ps version and the other versions on older systems have good reply value especially w friends  siblings
the graphics are good for a older fighting game
similar to the arcades
the controller configuration is good
this game has a pretty decent size roster of characters to play as
including bosses like shao kahngorokintaro
if you have a ps you can play this ps game on it
i have a ps w hd cables
and have went into my pss settings  configured it to play ps games
my ps has hdmi hooked up to a lcd
when playing this game on my lcd in the ps its sharp yet smudgy
just exposing the pixels a bit more
i still get down on it
if you have a older tv and play it on there itll look its best
a early s tv w hd inputs but not being a lcd will be the ultimate way to get its full potential
i recommend this game to anyone into mk games and old school fightersthe good the best of the bet era on one disc every character from umk and back all original alities fan favorite music and arenasthe bad some glitches load times are annoying can be very hard and cheap aggressor meter is not implemented wellwhat better way to end an era for a fighting genre then to throw it all into one big game
mkt does just this so for people only familiar with the d era this is what armageddon was based off of
every mk character up to ultimate mortal kombat  is in here plus all the mechanics from umk that everyone loved
the game introduces a new aggressor meter which is the predecessor of the power meter in the new mk
getting attacked will increase it which is just text at the bottom that fills up which i really hate and then you do extra damage while in aggressor mode
the combo system is still intact as well as the weapons from umkthe d games were silky smooth and the graphics look great in trilogy
every level as well as a lot of fan favorite music is in the game you can pull the soundtrack right off the disc
using the run button pulling off a  hit combo and then blocking jumping around and using all the signature moves brings back a great feeling of nostalgia
there are some secrets hidden in here such as a special code screen  button fatalities are awesome plus some original outfits like raiden and kanos original outfit which also unlocks their original fatality
of course the game is best played with two people but single player is also a lot of funthere are a few minor problems like shang tsungs morphs require loading load times between menu and fights plus the game will freeze some times which is no good
i also wish maybe test your might would have come back but this really just feels like mortal kombat the greatest hits
i also hate how cheap the computer can be on even normal difficulties plus shao kahn is one of the cheapest bosses in gaming history so good luck beating him
overall this is the ultimate mk experience for the bit era that made history
if you loved the older mk games then trilogy is exactly what you need plus this is probably the last time youll see animalities and brutalitiesthis game is very fun got ahead give it a shot its worth the price do i need to say anything elesbasically this is all the mortal kombats before it without the story lines
they have every single character
noob saibot is definately my favorite
you can also choose all the bosses from the beginning of the game
you can choose mk kano and raiden or mk kung lao or jax
this game is pretty tough
especially when you fight shao kahn
but he can be defeated
i have only beat him a couple of times
just the amount of content in the game is amazing
the graphics are superb
there is some slowdown but mainly at the end of an  player tournament or when shang stung transforms
overall one of my favorite gameshavent played this in years but it definitely brought back some memories of when i was a kid
good price good shippingthis game is by far one of my all time favorite fighting games
it has  on  matches and the combos are awesome
just has a really high fun factor in my book if you are a fan of the mk serieswhew
after being highly disappointed with the n version and playing it on the psx with my cousin i think that the psx version is the best mortal kombat game ever
i mean how can you go wrong with picking this excellent title up to build up on your ps collection
this has fatalities stage fatalities brutalities fatalities and many others
plus you can get the classic mk characters and stages
so if you do not have this game and have either or all of the three playstations that have came out i highly recommend you to pick this masterpiece upas usual our friends at midway and gamespy have put out an excellent ps game where you can kill each other and no one gets hurt
take it one bit or is it byte at a time
different fatalities different moves always exciting excellent producti wrote a review for the original doom released for the playstationand well take all of what i said there and put it here but final doom presents even more of a challengethis game is by far more difficult than any other doomthe background music is almost as creepy as the score the original hadbut very good nonethelessnot much has changed elsewhere other than the obvious  new levelsits really nothing more than an addon to the originalget it if you want more senseless carnage and mutilationhell if you like firstperson shooters and can nab this for under  bucks get it anyways
you wont be disappointed out of ps owners looking for a great fps experience shouldnt look any further than final doom which was released a few years back
its everything the original doom was only with new bigger levels a lot more enemies and a lot tougher gameplay
the only gripes that can be found is that archville and spidermastermind were not included in this conversion but the smooth frame rate gorgeous for its time graphics and challenging gameplay make final doom one of the best first person shooters for any system and is a clear overlooked gem for the good ol psit is a good port of  the pc version  and i guess the only drawback would be the password system within the game since you cant save your progress through your memory card  but i dont mind it too muchthis was purchased as part of my daughters christmas gift but since she was home for the holiday weekend i had her check it out and it worked just finegame arrived quickly and works great
love the doom series been playing it for years and will continue to play itthis is definitely my favorite action adventure mk game of all time
especially this playsation version that im reviewing
this is the last mk game to use the side scrolling d graphics
the player takes control of mks popular fighter subzero before he enters the mk tournament
the story takes place some years before the mk  storyline were subzero is given certain tasks to do for every mission
in short sub has a lot of special moves that the player has to earn throughout the game the spine rip fatality when you finish certain bosses which will affect certain parts of the games story combos a variety of different levels that are fantastic both in looks and music environmental traps getting across platforms the variety of enemies the bosses some familiarclassic mk bosses and others that are completely new and the climbing of different stories to get from one area to the next
the game has blood and gore as it should and it has full motion video cutscenes with real actors and realistic cgi backgrounds
this is definitely a great game that i recommend to any mk andor subzero fanclearly subzero is the best
he can freeze dudes and then make ice clones of himself and then he be all like yo dude touch this and then he touches it and he is frozen and subzero wins
this game be so hardcore
combos
figure them out nerd
fatalities
they havent told you them before and they wont start now fishstick
quanchi has it out for you and its up to you and fall in love with some chick kill her sisters and then be mad then she diesmi liked the game a lot
it was similar to most ps games control
i would recommend it to anyone who gets into mortal kombatwhile the original design of the stock sega dreamcast controller isnt altogether bad it reeks of low quality cheap parts with a loose and overly twitchy analog stick
this console was in dire need of a solidly built reliable and responsive third party option enter the madcatz dream pad
the first thing you will notice about the dream pad is that it feels solid
all of the buttons triggers and even the handles and chassis feel of a much more rugged and solid quality than you will find in the stock sega controller
it also has slightly flared grips with nonslip overgrips as compared to the plastic only dreamcast controller with grips that went straight down
this makes the pad imo more comfortable to hold for lengthy gaming marathons
if you have very tiny hands this may not be the controller for you though because it is a bit on the larger side
given its features and layout i dont think it could have been done better and believe most would find it very comfortableaside from all of the buttons analog stick and directional pad being highly responsive and accurate my favorite feature of the dream pad is the fact that both trigger buttons are also featured on the front
this allows you the option of using either the triggers or all of the buttons on the front
this layout makes this controller especially exceptional for fighting games
if you enjoy some capcom or snk fighters and want your power punches and kicks quick and accessible the dream pad is your answer
all moves are easily executed with the highly responsive controls on this madcatz offering
these are also fully programmable but i have found no use for that additional feature and havent attempted its use
if you own a dreamcast but are not a huge fan of the stock controller i cannot recommend this third party option enough
they can be found brand new at a great cost online and you will not be disappointedsimply put this is the very best button fighting game controller for the dreamcast that money can buyevery serious dreamcast owner should have onehad one for like  years and it still works great even todaythese things are built to last and can take tons of abuseslam it bash it mash it whateverthe large oversized contoured design fits comfortably in adultsized hands and the rubberized antislip pads ensure that this controller doesnt slip around at all during the most intense gaming momentsthe dpad and buttons are all very accurate and responsive and thats what really matters the most for fighting games ya knowthis awesome controller will allow you to bust out any special moves in your favorite fighting games with ease and flowscoring massive hit chain combos absolutely brutal and cheap on capcom vs snk  are no problem with this controllerif you like fast paced  degree action and big explosions this is it
i bought this years ago when i was a kid and this game first came out bought a ps recently and decided this game was worth buying again
you will not be disappointed in this arcade rd person shooter
awesome soundtrack by staticx goes along great with this theme as well
alot of origional ideas at hand here there needs to be an omega boost 
a must buy for any psx ownerwell most of us know about the great playstationg titles
final fantasy tekken metal gear solid
but there are titles out there that are every bit as good yet never get the attention that they deserve
omega boost is one of those gamesthis game has it all
the story is pretty decent
i wont spoil it here
the graphics are gorgeous
absoloutly incredable just be sure that when you play this game for the first time you play it with no one else around lest someone accidently step on your jaw when it falls to the floor
the music is very cool too
the intro music rocks big time and the in game stuff is funky
the game itself is just a brainless shoot em up
like rtype on steroids
and a hundread times more fun
all this stuff combines to give you a great fun game that anyone can play and enjoygive it shot
youll be glad you didaside from the alltosin of pride price tag here it is a superb collective of games spanning from my childhood on
ultima  was produced in i began playing in  the game originally had what was called good graphics and it still stands as a good playing game today the graphics are block but it is still fun
ultima  is great though the last of the block and black games it is excellent in storytelling value and plot as well as some gameplay elements
ultima  is also good set of games a  part adventure spanning two continentson sosaria
the best of this saga ultima  is memorable but nothing fancy but it is more than the prequals though a bit moral istic
ultima  the latest on this set being windows based is a good fun game on the darker side of  antimorality needed to surviveas in panic in the year zero type avatar
i like the plot and controversial element in  though it is not as good as  it is smaller and the dialogue less interesting
it is still a good game
you have no friendsfitting as you are kidnapped and alien to a different world
you have a couple of contacts and a bit of action but unlike  you have little in the way of plot through your actions only an arcade you die i dont approach to the quest
ultima  is worse though you have more plot and dialogue it is lame and just plain awful and not just becaue of the voice actors
u isnt here it wasnt that memorable anyway just fun but bug ridden enough to quit in the middle
typical emergence of corperate america  in videogames the last of the elite genere gone to the lowest common demoninator
ucas in the dos folderfor those who know what dos even is is the best all time games in a group
heros quest a close second nearly on the mark  wizardry a mixed bag but a thirdimo mmnot heros a a fair round out last though not too bad a bit sillythis title is still a must have for any action gamer
i use it most to play deathmatch using the quotweapons of destructionquot mod
but there has been soooo much developement using the quake ii platform that almost any gamer can find a mod they enjoy
moreover with the state of the art graphics cards you can turn the resolution all the way up and not take a performance hit
as far as game play it is still one of my favorites
i actually prefer it over quake iii
quake iii is just a bit too fast and all the levels are very similar
quake ii has the most variety that is once you get out on the internet and start downloading new modsmapsmodels
in addition q has a single player story line game in addition to its deathmatch stuff
the other reason i like this title is that you can play it reasonably well on a laptop
my laptop is just too slow when trying to handle unreal tournament quake  or star trek elite force
all in all a must have it is fun and there is lots of variety out there to tweak the basic versionquake  is much more than a game its a gaming phenomenon
this game set the standards and provided the very engine of hordes of firstperson shooters as well as less killorbekilled oriented games that followed in its wake
it took online gaming to new heights with its plethora of multiplayer options
gamers the world over designed their own maps and created their own online worlds in which to raise havoc against the strogg hordes as well as their best buddies
some seven years after its release in  quake  is still more than capable of brazenly stealing ones entire day weekend week and beyond
quake was great fun mind you but there you were on defense trying to defend your planet against these mechanistic aliens who decided that humans would make great raw material for new cyborgs although some lucky individuals would of course find their ultimate fate in the form of exotic ingredients for certain strogg gourmet delicacies
in quake  you take the fight to the stroggs by gum you smear their guts across their own walls you add a little chaos to the uglified place they call a home planet and you make those soldiers pay for having dared attack earth before youre done you bring makron himself the biggest and baddest strogg of them all to his knees before terminating him with extreme prejudicethose strogg are wily though
oh we all thought it was a good idea to secretly follow the brutes back to stroggos through their black holegenerated gateway theyll never see us coming we said and well be on them like white on rice before they even have time to blink a biomechanical eye
we were wrong
the stroggs took out a majority of our pods before the invasion even got started but you made it to the planets surface  albeit way off target
youll have a little help from hq in terms of your missions but its pretty much up to you alone to somehow infiltrate and destroy the enemy
youll see stuff here you never saw in quake  new monsters much smarter enemies the stroggs actually learned how to duck more puzzles albeit of the find button and push it variety and  best of all  more carnage
when you get one of these guys down youd better make sure hes dead a guy with no legs can still shoot a gunsome of these infernal puzzles can be frustrating at times but just about any player can play this entire game in singleplayer mode and come out victorious given enough time and saved games then once you start thinking youre all big and bad you can play at a higher difficulty level
youd better be good before challenging your friends to some multiplayer mayhem when youre ready to go online though youll find countless multiplayer options at your disposal
the worlds pretty much your oyster when it comes to multiplayer options ensuring that quake  will be played and played some more for a long time to comequake ii is one of the original gems of pc gaming if not just gaming itself
the graphics were pure gold for its time and really they didnt age too bad
the soundtrack was killer
and the enemy types and guns were just huge
this is probably one of the best shooters to ever hit the scene and is still very much enjoyable to this day
the single player is incredible fun and can be played in coop much like all of the older id software games
the game does have sort of the blue key feel to some of the levels but really that added a bit to the game
some may find that type of gameplay to be dated but at least this makes a bit more sense rather just all doors being opened like todays games
do aliens not have locks anymore
one of the coolest things about this game is having the a dead body attract flies to it black pixels to be exact swarm bodies
it gives you a feel that theres stink in the gamemultiplayer is amazing fun too as it can host up to  players in arena style bliss
using a service like xfire of gamespy you can still play this game online and enjoy what many of us enjoyed years ago
theres still an active community and its great to be able to tear it down old skool in this terrific gamethough not quite as awesome as the original quake quake ii still offers plenty of entertainment as you embark in a futuristic hell to defeat fleshrotten cyborgs
more types of guns with the ever so awesome bfgquake  is one of the if not the best d fps games i have ever played first of the level is detailed and superb reminding me of the first half of doom it realy does seem like an industrial planet of machine people the music is downright awesome really fitting for the kind of gameplay quake  has all of the guns are powerful and balanced my personal favorites is the railgun and super shotgun and the enemies are all great looking and original there isnt much of a story but honestly it would probably just get in the way
probably the only things i dont like is there is way to much ammo in this game the boss fights are rather easy and even on the highest difficulty i played through the entire game and probably died less than  times
mainly the game is just to easy but with that said this game is fantastic and i would recomend it to anyone for just being really fun easy to get into and being a memorable fpsdespite what all the critics have to say i really like quake  theres just something about it that keeps me playing it over and over
the graphics are a noticeable step above the original quakes and the gameplay is nice and sturdy
the missions in quake  have a flowing feel to them that makes you believe you are working towards something
the sound is superb with all the explosion sound effects one would expect for this type of game and the opening music in the first level is a great mood setter for the game
the ending is a little brief but id has never been known for producing storylines of epic proportions anyway
online death match play while not up to par with some other games of the same genre is still quite fun and adds lots of replay value
if youre a fan of first person shooters get quake  now and pick up the mission packs while they are still availablethis game is one of the best old pc games you are going to find
along with duke nukem d quake and doom this was one of the games that pushed forward the shooter genere of gaming to where it is today
this is also one of the few older games that works well not only on windows xp but also on vista and windows  as wellthis game is addictive as anything the shooting is great the violence is awesome and the game play is phenominal
controls are super easy and the graphics were great for their time
do not hesitate to buy this game as you will love it and you will never stop playing itthe game has great replay value as you can play on easy medium and hard and there are tons of secrets throughout the game
if it gets too easy for you try beating the game with only your pea shooter blaster you wanted replay value there it is
definately go out and buy this game it is an awesome addition to any collection
regardless of how far graphics have come today this game still beats out many current games in the shooter genere
i wont name names for fear of upsetting the little fanboysalso quake  is just as awesome although i like  better
quake  like doom is the grandfather of modern shooters while quake  is the father
you wont be disappointed with either gamego and get it now
you need this gamea good one for the collection
it brings back some good memories from the s and the old pentium  dayswhat a fun racing game
i played it with a few friends and we had a blast
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good group or two person gamesimply this is one of the best acrade style racing games ever made
dont be put off because it is boats
if you like the feel of arcade racing games that are over the top with hidden paths and speed this one is for youthis game has  tracks
you start the game with  tracks which are easy level but after you beat those  then the others become selectablethere are also  boats which become selectable after beating each track
although  of those  boats are very difficult to obtain on one player mode
they are however easy to obtain on two player modei have possesion over one of the best racing games not only on the dreamcast but of all timethe graphics are not that great to the average gamer but it brings back a nostalgic racing feel
the arcade style racing brings a great feel to the player
there are an amount of cheat codes
i got mine just today and i already have all boats and tracks because of cheats
so that would help the gamer get something that they dont feel like working for
the controls are niceto conclude i absolutely love this game
this is one of the best games on my dreamcast besides jet grind radio
you should definitely get this game
there are great prices in the collectable section of the new and used offers sectionso happy to find this brand new for a really good price having to fight sibling to be able to play one step closer to collecting all final fantasy gamesi bought the pc version of this game but theres not difference between the two story wise
the only real difference is that the optional mini game chocobo world is easier to use on the pc since you dont have to buy a pocketstation
however that doesnt take away the fact that this is a truly great game to play
if you pay close attention from the beggining youll have a great time meeting all the characters and seeing all the sights or the ffviiis world
the characters are believable and easy to relate to the graphics while somewhat dismal on the world wap are quite excellent once you go into certain areas like balamb garden or the shumi village
the music is also quite entertaining theres something for everyone in this game
those who say that this game is either boring or makes no sense was probably not paying much attention while playing
the random battles can be tuned down if you spend the time to figure out how
if you are looking for a great game with a great story you cant go wrong with final fantasy viiiff is one of squresofts best releases
this game is about a mercenary who joins an underground resistance group to defeat an evil sorceress
eventually he falls in love with a member of resistance and is intent on getting her life back after it is taken by an evil sorceress in the futurewhen ff first came out i couldnt get over some of the qualities that just werent typical ff style like the way they walked
in most ff games the characters are inside the lead character but not in this one
i eventually got over it and im glad i did because the game turned out to be awesomei strongly reccomend this game to any ff fan because this game offers nice graphics a deep storyline filled with love hate betrayal and pretty cool combat moves
the above review said that a con on this game is the fact that there are to many random battles but that actually helps for quick levelingthe one downside to this game is that the last boss ultimecia is very hard and so i reccomend getting as much work in the game done as possible before entering lunatic pandorathis game is great
i love the music and the battles
my fav
part about this game is the leveling up
it only takes  exp to gain a level
no more  exp to get to level  the magic in this game is cool too
you draw it from the monsters and can use it off of them as well
the plot is interesting and theres a lot of cool extra stuff as welli admit when i first heard about ff i was skeptical
i thought quothow could square match ffquot doubtless i still wanted the game so i placed my reserve on the game about  month in advance
so the day of september   came the whole  thing and i got it
i popped it in and instantly was blown away
i saw the opening seen and knew right then that the quotmature animequot of the characters were amazing
i mean you see the detail that square includes in just the opening sequence and you are amazed
so i played for a while and put it away till christmas
school started i pulled it back out at christmas time and decided to play
i got through the first disc that day and then i sat around for hours just playing triple triad
for those of you who do not know what it is it is a sort of ccg in the videogame
once you start though it just takes up tons of time and it is totally amazing how ingrosing this quotgame inside a gamequot is
i loved getting all the gf cards and the main character cards and such
i just want to say if you get the chance to buy this game then devote hours to triple triad just like all of us devoted hours to gold saucer
other than that the new quotjunction systemquot is the new form of magicsummon
you junction gf to you which gives you abilities higher attackmagic points and other stuff like that
you have to draw magic from animals in the world around you
its that it just makes you wonder where they got the magic from
the best part about this game though is the amazing storyline
it changes a whole lot and like most rpgs this one lives off of its storyline
if you are a final fantasy fan or just an rpg or videogame fan then treat yourself to this  disc monster
you will not be sorrythis game is one of the best rpgs ever made for any system
its junction system takes some getting used to but before long it is much easier than materia from ff
the graphics are great the characters are well developed and most importantly the story is great
basically you are a student of magic and must become the leader you never wanted to be
along the way youll meet a former teacher of magic an overconfident jerk along with his posse a comic bookish hot headed hero a rowdy energetic girl a responsible school headmaster a girl crazy sharpshooter a friendly former soldier a big quiet caring man and a clumsy future world leader
you start out being a cold mean anti social person but eventually become a caring romantic truthful guy with the help of your girlfriendyou must save the world from three witches one of which may well have been a valueble ally in the past and futurethis game will prove to be moving and exciting
its the first rpg ive played with a love story
just dont give up at the end of disc three
many dookaylets get one thing straight
on technical merits there is no argument that any person can make that this isnt the greatest game in the series to the point that it was made
to put it simply the graphics are mindblowing
i started this game immediately after finishing seven and from the opening scene i can assure you that you wont find better in the earlier series
as always the sound is solid and the gameplay is well structured so what you end up with is a game that is in fact technically superior to anything square had done to that point and is still impressive todaythe concern that most people have with this game however has nothing to do with the technical merits and ill admit that theres some merit to complaints about the games story
while the idea that square set out with in development is fine ultimately the tale fails to break out of the same old pattern thats been carved out for final fantasy games from the beginning
ostensibly a love story and i can assure you that it works well in that regard as the individual character development and storytelling is honest and well paced the plot seems to vascilate schizophrenically between a poorly described threat to the survival of the world and the plight of the individual characters
this can get frustrating at times especially considering the fact that the story could have been told just as effectively if the writers had never worried about introducing the notion of saving the world
in the end however the plot confusion turned out to be a wash for me since the real story the love story is told as adeptly as the genre and cultural incompatibilities will allowconsidering the price that this game carries right now the sheer technical impressiveness that it shows and the great history of the series its probably fair to say that any playstation gamer should add this to their collection
at twenty dollars just the cg movies alone are worth the price of admission and if youre willing to learn a new advancement system the junction system while it infringes upon the uniqueness of individual characters is fun in its own right you should find that the game itself is entertaining and enjoyable to play
while there may be some plot mistakes in total this game still has to be considered a smashing success and a welcome addition to any gamers libraryi remember watching some of the movies in this game being absolutely starstruck
i was amazed at what they could do with that technology
looking back its not that great compared to what we have now but back in the day it was amazingif i were to ever to play one game ever again it would be final fantasy viii
its great battles memorable characters and a deep mature storyline makes it my favorite final fantasy if not favorite gameffviii introduces the new junction system
this system eliminates the mp magic system and instead the only way you gain magic is by using the draw command to suck it out of your enemies
in order to use the junction system you must have acquired a gf or summon in other ffs and link with them to build your abilites and statsthe story is what made me come back to this game so many times that ive memorized the whole game
it starts out with this elite group of highly trained soldiers called seeds from a cadet called garden
the main character squall has just passed his seed exam and is preparing for his first mission
he meets with a young woman named rinoa who is fighting for her states independence
through many twists in the story they end up in a quest to destroy a sorceress from the future who threatens to compress all time to dominate the universefrom its exciting beginning to its great ending final fantasy viii is one of the best rpgs to grace the playstation or any consolethis is a game that may look a little bit rushed on the surface compared to ff but look in between the lines download the helpful final fantasy  guide from gamespotcom and get to know the games secrets
because they are manyindepth story great music antihero main character and some truly amazing cinemas
you dont want anything more in a game like this than what square has been able to put into these four wonderful cds
i cant recommend this game enough it rules compared to kiddie final fantasy  it will at least be remembered by me and probably by you as one of the most stunning rpgs that has ever graced the playstation in all its time before playstation  finally arrived
you would want to get this game and try it out if you havent already it truly is a gem to beholdby far one of the best rpgs out there
the graphics are just fantastic
this game really makes you think and you will still miss secrets making this game purchase worthyi know everyone is entitled to their own opinions but for this sort of game bad opinions are rendered useless
this game is underrated for the wrong reasons sadly ff is too
youll find that most people who hate ff like ff
this is not true for all but from what i have seen most
and some of them cant even get the damn characters name right or played the whole game through but still giving a review
i have heard this is a romance game
actually ff was the most romantic one
play it over if you dont believe me
i have beat ff including all the other boring milked parts
i can honestly say it was not as half as good as 
dont get wrong ff was great but as i easily breezed through it on first try without training i realized that it was no challenge
the storyline didnt have me screaming for more just being honest
after everything i heard about ff i had my hopes up high
they were dropped when i discovered that there was nothing special about this game when i already beat ff
and still i am waiting for a final fantasy that can match this one
the only thing keeping my interest in ff was sephiroth and vincent
vincent actually was the only lead character i played with when discovering him in sephiroths mansion after he set it aflame
oh and this was when cloud was loosing himself
so we not only lost him but tifa for a short while too
i could give so many reasons why ff is one of the best rpgs out there but of course there will always be someone you cant pleasefinal fantasy  was nothing short of amazing even in the credits
the overture was already a mind blowing number from nobuo uematsu
the picture quality like ff at the time was breathtaking
so as you start a new game you are already thrown into another beautiful musical score under the theme of sorceress edea
you then see several flashes and a fight between seifer and squall
so this intro already had my attention
after the opening ends squall is in the infirmary and the game pretty much goes from there
i am not going to give a walkthrough but in storyline the game really went above and beyond
this is the reason why they call final fantasy final fantasy
we see progression in squall who pretty much could be a rival of cloud and also the other characters in the game
from the ballroom dance dollet landing the missions sorceress possessions to the space scenes the developing intimacy between characters and the final boss battles i can play this game over and over
storyline the gameplay seems to strike an irritating nerve with some gamers
first i must say i have seen worse ff battle systems
actually you get to take a break from needing to have mp elixirs whatnot or upgrading materia and just stock magic
this only becomes a problem if you stock every freaken magic you see
only stock the well worth magic
your level must be high enough to get certain types so train well or if you are an expert use other means
however the atb system is active so you must move quickly
i love the almost min cinematic moves which reminds me a lot of legend of dragoon
this final fantasy mixes that and then takes music and fighting to a whole new scale
you know if the music changes or slows down the boss is going to be a problem omega adel griever ultimecia etc
also guys the junction is easy as hell to learn
it was so easy to put together that i learned it within a few minutes after buy
these are not valid reasons to throw the game under the bus
final fantasy gameplay shouldnt be so repetitive
but to continue like all ff parts we get to see some of the same summonings and powerful magic on the field
gameplay i am not going into the music seeing as i already have
ill just say the whole soundtrack is worth downloading from itunes
excellent
perfect
the characters are what make ff parts fun
ff has a grand scale of well developed characters
even the not so talked about characters like ward laguna and kiros were awesome
lagunas theme along with almost the entire soundtrack is memorable
as the main characters progress we get to keep track of squalls uncle and his events regarding ellone
you get to play with a conceded sniper irvine and zell the punching and kicking machine
the women on this ff game are actually worth playing and not so delicate as aerith from ff
selphie and rinoa can be very suprising with their inner strengths
have you ever came across the end
i kid you not i used this on soceress adel many times and it worked
with ultimecia using rinoa is awesome because her dog angelo can be strong
and lets not forget the gunblade specialist squall whose attacks are never short of amazing
i am not a fan of quistis but if you like her she can get her specials from random items
overall ps it is up to you if you are going to believe all the lies about ff
i actually find that the games most people praise a lot are not the ones worth buying
not to go off topic but games like silent hill resident evil and fear may be considered the best horror games
but really games like fatal frame haunting ground the calling rule of the rose kuon koudelka etc are  times better in storyline or scarierits a completely weird thing to say that the most polarizing final fantasy game in the entire series happens to be my favorite of them
i found vii great but kind of sluggishlypaced ditto with ix which had attractive visuals lovely music but a slow narrative at times
with viii the graphics got kicked up a notch the fmvs became more cinematic and the storyline was more adult and sophisticated
however some love it and many hated it and theres still people who outright despite this game
sure its got a few nagging problems but in my opinion this was my favorite in the series to experiencestory you play as squall a student at the balamb garden which specializes in turning students into seeds elite mercenaries that get dispatched to different parts of the world to resolve conflicts
one mission has him getting involved with the timber owls a resistance group headed by rinoa
squall and rinoa along with  others will eventually get caught up in a story involving space travel a powerful sorceress and a trip through timegraphics oftencriticized for having popeye arms the characters now look completely realistic and proportioned evenly
the world itself however looks kind of drab as there isnt a lot of locations that make you go holy 
 esthar being the exception
but where the game shines is the fmvs which have an even more movielike quality in its direction and look than viis
while the change from prerendered to the fmvs is obvious now it helps make the transitions more seamlesssoundmusic no voice acting till x but again we have another great soundtrack by nobuo uematsu
anyone whos ever listened to the soundtracks knows that hes hit and miss and for one amazing track like liberi fatali man with the machine gun or the extreme theres completely average and even bad tracks
but its got a bit more thematic similarities from track to track so its more consistentgameplay the everpresent annoyance for gamers and it all comes down to the junction system
each game has had different ways on how characters played the game
from the esper system to materia to the sphere grid characters levelled up uniquely from game to game
viiis different in that for one thing we dont have mp anymore
you draw it from enemies getting  to around  or so spells to use with the limit being  while it is annoying that you can have a finite number of spells i like the idea of junctioning them to your stats to make them more powerful or adding resistance to a certain spell or status effectthe other idea presented is the idea of the enemies levelling up along with you
no longer can you spend an hour beating enemy after enemy in hopes that the boss will be easier this time
basically the enemy gets powerful just as you do when you level up so its best to just be weak as it were
also in previous games shops or even enemies carried character weapons and armor that were more powerful than the one currently equipped well now the weapon has to be synthesized
get a certain number of items and the magazine listing the weapon take it to a shop and theyll turn it into a weapon
of course you dont know what enemy even has them and youd have to consult an faq to figure out who has whaton one hand the game does have some issues nay some huge issues but for some reason i think about reexperiencing this game more than the others which is strange
might not be everyones favorite final fantasy but for me it iswithout a doubt the characters in this game are the most realistic
whoever writes that they are too cheesy or corny has not lived in the real word even though im solitary and introverted i was able to realize that
the way square made each characters behaviour was enough to make me love the game though the graphics werent my favorite
as these chars are teenagers not adults the way that they act is completely natural for people whose method of emotions has not evolved into that of an adult duh
the whole prodigy thing was a bit much but it didnt take away from my enjoyment of the gamealso the distinction of behaviour between the adults and the children and teenagers is superb
square really put a lot of emotional study into this game and it shows
the characters in this game are the most human i have seen for a long time
also the originality of the plot must be why many people hate it they want the same old hint on old characters that have always appeared in ff titles the plot to be the same and the characters to all be dragoons or black mages
sorry to burst your bubble but this game is original aside from its title
it breaks away it is unorthodox but that is quite all right when you look at the alternative ffix which is basically a universal plot with no real good original ideas and square made up for it with cramming tons of stuff from the other  games into the sceneit sucked
my opinion
buy it every penny is worth it
unless you dont like originality
then you should have stopped reading this review and started to send me hatemail after the first few sentencesdue to this being a review of a much older game there are newer titles to compare this one too
however despite having poorer graphics than ff x and being that there is no voice acting in this title when there should have been at least for the fmvs its easy to avoid going back to this title for those who have yet to play it
this however would remain a mistake
like star trek the best final fantasy games end in an even number and ff viii is no exception
the graphics were the pinnacle of playstation graphics and the sound track remains arguably the best of the franchise
the story is where the game really shines
its a romance something that square hadnt done effectively in the past
this game excels at the romance aspects of the story where all other ff games have failed
more importantly for me is that the main character is not an overly perky blonde hair blue eyed happy dude but one much more like myself
darker moodier and misunderstood as being distant and cold
squall has a great deal of objections to overcome in identifying and getting a firm grip on love and even then he has trust issues making him a character that is much easier for me to identify with as squall and i are a lot alike
not easy to admit but true
it was also nice to see an ff game without the generic overly happy personality
it was also nice to see a lead male in ff without blonde hairthe game play was where this game left many people wanting
the junction system had quite a steep learning curve and no matter how much work i did with the cast nobody ever did  damage without the aid of a gf summon
while i enjoyed the guardian force summons and never tired of them many people did not and wanted to skip them
the option to do so would have been nice
i also wish that the characters could learn skills and such without having to have a gf equipped
the game is too reliant on summons and it would have been nice to have the characters have strengths and weaknesses on their ownalthough i love this game i would like to see a remake of the game in the vein of resident evil for gamecube
using similar technology square could easily upgrade the graphics sound and game play to put this game on par with the recent final fantasy x if they really wanted to it could look as good as resident evil if they made it for the gamecube
earlier some websites reported that remakes of vii viii and ix for the next gen consoles were being considered
being that ff viii could have been much better even though it was great its fun to imagine how it could be on next gen consoles if square realizes the true potential of this epic masterpiecethis was the first rpg i ever played and  years later im still playing it over
its fun and the bosses are challenging although the final bosses is pretty easy to kill
the last time i played i made it a mission to beat ultima weapon as i consider that to be the equivalent of beating the game and then some
i think this game has the most realistic feel out of all the ff games ive played
sure there are monsters a lady that looks like a witch magic and other unrealistic things but the world it is set in seems very possible to me and i think thats what initially drew me in
plus i think the opening sequence was the best out of any ff to dateok in  this game was releaed
many people were like omg
this gam suck comp too vee eye eye
but i loved it
its not as good as vii but only by a hairgameplay a new rpg where you are in the military seed
you have many summons called gfs
its a long game about  hours
lots of sidequests toook many have complaints about  the junction system
its too complicated
wahhhh
well read the goddamn tutorial
is glad to get that out of my systemgraphics for the time they are excellent
the fmvs kick assmusic another high point
you might be humming the great tunesstory ok there is a lot of bashing with it
personally i liked squall and others because they act realistic
plus lots of plot twistsoverall a great game overlooked by many
so relax and quit complaing guysit has been a while since i last completed this game perhaps over two years but even to this day i love it
it can still be addicting even though i have beaten it at least  times and mastered the whole thing at least twice
i think what stands out with this game are the characters
most games just develop ordinary backrounds for characters but dont really emphasize them but with this game the story almost is the charactersit basically revolves around their life how they met how they are related to laguna and his friends and stuff of that sort
i have played and beaten almost all of the final fantasys save a few of the japanese ones and the ps ones but this game really stands out and is possibly the greatest in my opinion
ff and ff are also very good along with  and the first one
i just cant find a flaw herethe love story is fantastic  you will really get into squall and rinoas relationship together
i also think squall is a very interesting character as others have said you will want to get into his mind and find out what makes him tick
when i first played this game i thought it was horrible but i gave it another chance and it really grew on me
if you are looking for more of a mario rpg style game or final fantasy  style game you will be disappointed
if you can accept an rpg with the story revolving around something some sort of love story this is for you but i can assure you this is not your typical final fantasy
the sound is also fantastic and doesnt repeat the same tunes over and over too often like some other games xenogears
the graphics arent bad either
blahjust get itnotice the devisiveness of most of the customer reviews of this game there is a reason for this ffviii is a definite lovehate title
its rare that i find anyone who says quoteh ffviii was okquotthe thing about ffviii is it strays away from what quotrpgquot has meant to most videogame rpg players over the last  or so years
it breaks many rpg traditions even more than ffvii did
meanwhile many companies are still recycling the innovations made many years ago in previous ff games
if youre new to the rpg genre and have no preexisting bias you would be a fool not to give this game a try
its a must
however if you are a longtime ff fan you will fall into one of two catagoriesa conservative these are generally the people who hate ffviii
they discovered the ff series with ffi or iv or vi and to them that is what an ff game has to be when an ff game moves away from the earlier style and sensibility of the series d  or  bit graphics ultralighthearted script a story even a five year old with down syndrome could grasp they scream bloody murder and quotworst ff game ever
a disgrace to the ff namequot they would rather play halfbaked cookie cutter rpgs like suikoden
they know what they like and thats all they want
they would be happy to play the same games over and over and over for eternity just change the names of the characters and slap a new title on it and theyll think theyre playing something newb progressive we also started playing ff on the nes or snes but these fans are in love with not only the ff games themselves but they also value the actual evolution development and growth of the series
sometimes accused of being quotmasochisticquot or quotmindlessquot squaresoft fans the truth of the matter is that over the course of many years and many games we have seen squaresoft time and time again show that they simply tower above the competing videogame developers
square and their games are not perfect but they certainly come closer to perfection than anyone else
ffviii is no exceptionone of the best features of the game is the cast of characters and their characterization
these are perhaps the mostfleshed out and realistic characters ever seen in an rpg
each one has a very distinct and welldefined personality
and when anyone says that squall the lead character has no personality please ignore them
he does have a clear personality which just so happens to be extremely lowkey calm and cool
the story itself is unlike any other rpg youve ever played
rather than the the complex and grandiose epic that was ffvii or the operatic and sweeping ffvi ffviii is a bit more along the lines of a mystery intertwined with a romance
gameplay is also radically shifted from the norm
magic spells are taken from enemies rather than learned by leveling or unlocked from items
these spells can then be attatched to a characters various stats in order to boost them
for those who love micromanagement its heaveni believe ffviii to be a true masterpiece and i recommend it to all gamers with the exception of bitter and closedminded quotold skool ff fansquotthere are few series i consider to even be on the same level as the twelve official games in the final fantasy legacy and of those i consider chapter eight to be the undeniable pinnacle
which considering its predecessor the nearly omnipotent fanboy wet dream that was ffvii says one hell of a lot
this title had every reason to underwhelm from the groundbreaking success that preceded it and the enormous shadow of expectations it had cast to the wildly different path it chose to tread in terms of storyline themes and visual direction yet it succeeds all the sameas is the case with any rpg the best place to start with ffviii is its storyline
while chapter seven was focused on a maniacal egomaniac and his plans to destroy the world through the use of magic and spirituality alone chapter eight concerns itself more with the political and technological necessities of performing such a feat
not quite as exciting material at a glance but twice as realistic
sorceress edea the main protagonist of the story sets about on her aspirations by overthrowing the government of the largest military power in the world brainwashing its citizens through the use of the media invading and obliterating everyone in her path and manipulating her underlings to the point where she has their complete support without even expanding upon her motivations
where the glam and glitter of cloud and sephiroths tale has become legendary the struggles of squall and rinoa against their oppressors feel much more weighty and god help me believablelikewise the central characters in and around your party are much more relatable and varied than those in vii
where cloud tifa and aerith the previous leads were generally onedimensional and cartoony spitting incredible dialog despite their shortcomings viiis characters each have elaborate personalities perks downfalls and tendencies
though hes initially far less charismatic and appealing than cloud his immediate predecessor squall is a tremendously complex wellrounded lead character with an established psychological excuse for his aggrivatingly antisocial nature
the villains are similarly developed with an equal amount of redeemable qualities tossed in to keep their more prominent negative characteristics in check
youre never faced with a simple black and white boss fight as you were in previous chapters theres always something about the person youre battling that you can relate to
you form such an incredible bond to the characters in your party that the final cinema is a truly emotional experience one of the most rewarding and worthwhile conclusions ive ever experienced in gamingwhere every previous chapter in the final fantasy story had basically opened with the lead characters already trained and experienced in their professions ff is the first to tell the story of how these characters were first educated as supersoldiers which natural reservations they had with their chosen role and just how awkward their first steps as pros really were
in a way this story is half platoon and half breakfast club
the characters form a bond under extreme circumstances both with each other and with the player and develop into skilled fighters before theyre even comfortable talking openly about their feelingsvisually ff was and still is an unbelievable sight
the photorealistic characters settings and effects all but set the stage for the picturesque beauty of final fantasy x the cutscenes remain an almost speechless affair and the character designs and overall visual theme of the game itself are just breathtaking
this is a game id die to see simply reproduced in high definition at some point in the near future as it pushed the old psone above and beyond the limits of its hardware
the cinemas are occasionally marred by some artifacts caused by the necessary compression to fit this onto four discs and the ingame visuals just scream for the power to deliver what theyre so obviously capable of
the visual accomplishments of this game are just staggering and the final cinematic caught me offguard yet again by just blowing away the modern competition
this game was produced in  and for its opening and closing cutscenes to tear apart their modern contemporaries more than a half decade later should say more than a few things about how aweinspiring these graphics truly areand equally complimenting the humongous strides in the visual department is what id loudly proclaim to be the best soundtrack of the series
as was becoming the norm by this point each character vehicle town and dungeon has its own accompanying theme song but never before had the tunes been so closely intertwined and related as they are here
the softly plucked strings of the balamb garden your base of operations for the majority of the game are touched upon and mentioned throughout nearly the entire soundtrack bringing the entire experience fullcircle and tethering it to whats quickly identified by both story and player alike as your home
even the overly sappy jpop love ballad eyes on you which is possibly one of the more annoying things ive ever heard on its own fits in amazingly when surrounded by the rest of this impressive score
nobuo uematsu has never produced finer nor more immediately recognizable and emotional workno matter what i say i can never feel as though im doing this game justice
its a masterwork the greatest end product to ever emerge from the renowned studios of squaresoft
its concentration on the organization application and implementation of magic into each characters physical attributes appealed to the analretentive librarian in me while the epic storyline unimaginably cool cutscenes and untouchable characters swept me off my feet
i have my doubts about squares ability to recapture this past glory considering the slow downward slope theyve presented with each new chapter of the final fantasy series since the turn of the millennium but that cant drag down my utter devotion to the perfection of this titlehow you guys can decide if one ps final fantasy is better than the other
they are all very very very good for a game with graphics storyline and gameplay like this deserves a  if this was the only ff on ps the average rating would be  stars
i dont think ffvii or ffix are much better than this
its definitely worth your buck
in my opinion rpgs are what ps is really about and the ffs prove itthis game is by far the best game ive played although ive only played and beat a couple gamesthe battle system is awesome and is very customizablelike you can junction stuff too your hpattackm defensestatus defenseand a lot moreand it can even be a fun processthe sound is very good and does not get on my nerves like other people saywhich i dont even pay attention to the sound because im to in to the gamethe ending song is very goodthe gameplay is awesomei love the enimies and the bosses are ussually pretty toughthe gfs are very coolthe side quests are very funthe story is amazingit gets better and better til the very end of the castthe cg cinemas are amazing and will never be called bad graphics from here to wheneverthe graphics are very good for the psxi highly reccomend buying this game if you like rpgs or adventure gamesthere is not need to say anything about this because you already know what you will be purchasing
final fantasy rocksif you thought vii couldnt be beaten think again viii offers much more than vii could have but falls short in some areas that vii was the king inthe only real problem with viii is its storyline
while good in many many areas some of it seems rather drained or slowpaced but the game makes up for it in its graphical department and beautiful characters
no other lineup in the ff series has had so much variety in cast as  hasif you cant enjoy viii chances are it is because of its overall story
ive talked to people who thought it was gay or just plain boring and if you feel that then i kind of pity you
youre missing out on a great adventureits final fantasy
if you bought it expecting something new you need a reality check
but theres just enough plot twists that the averageread someone who hasnt played  ffs or reads tvtropes will be surprisedbut if youre genre savvy or just really good at connecting dotsedited review as ive finally played the gamei have mixed feelings about this game because although it is my fourthfavorite ff game its design was singlehandedly conducive to the end of the golden age of final fantasy because this game served as a precedent for ff designers to consider realism in an ff game to be a virtue in its own right and substitutable for some of the emphasis which they had previously placed on originality continuity and integration of the various aspects of a game
starting with ff every game in the ff series is very epic in scope but fails to fill the framework of its design with sufficient plot and characterrelated details
in final fantasy vii there are so many tiny optional events which round out the mythos of the games world in ways that may be unappreciated at first but collectively contribute a sense of groundedness to the fantastical setting
take the discovery of gast and ifalnas videos in icicle for example
final fantasy viii still has these types of details such as the ability to read about garden on squalls workstation terminal
it just doesnt have nearly enough such details to flesh out the world and after ff this element of the series only gets worse
upon reaching esthar the largest city in ff the player almost as quickly leaves it and less seems to be happening there than in the small islandtown of balambff is a great game
although somewhat ruined by the story of ff ffs hero does have dynamism and personality and the ability to read the heros thoughts is a great enhancement to the games storytelling
many recurring symbols emerge through objects equipment and special effects in battles to represent the characters the cross the lion the angel wing
the abstract flower field scenes lend significance to the literal ones and the significance of laguna julia raine and ellones story lends a sense of inevitability to squall and rinoas attraction
figuring out and using the junction system is lots of fun for the player although the gameplay could have been improved significantly with one or two simple changes such as limiting the amount of magic that the party may draw from each monsterff has the unfortunate curse of being the next in line after ff
that means it had a lot of hype to live up to
i suspect thats why some people will hate this game it just isnt ff
however even though this game isnt ff its an extremely good rpg that stands on its own merits
its one of my favorite games of all time just as good as ff although my absolute favorite game is ff
well lets jump right into the reviewgraphics score  the graphics were superb when this game came out and are still excellent in my opinion
i still find them pleasing to the eye
of course im not nearly as picky as some people and obviously i recognize that its graphics are older now but they were magnificent for their timemusic score  wow
when i first heard the opening song liberi fatali i was blown away
the rest of the games music doesnt dissapoint either
be it exciting songs or mellow tunes ff delivers
i actually went and bought the soundtrack which i still listen to to this daycharacters score  who doesnt love squall
hes quite likeable in a grumpy antisocial sort of way  plus hes an excellent case study in avoidantattachment disorder
ha ha seriously though the characters are very welldeveloped
i love having unique introspection into the psyche of a main character
the rest of the characters are excellent too
everyone has a distinctive personality and a role to play in the story no one feels like they were tacked on at the last minute just to increase the party size a problem with some other rpgs ive played im looking at you ff
the characters are portrayed very well and you will become attached to them very quicklystory score  the story too is excellent
i was thoroughly engaged by it it has just the right balance of character development and intriguing plot points to keep you entertained
ive played this game at least six times now over the years and im still not sick of itbattle system score  combat is turnbased like most final fantasies
you draw magic out of enemies to cast directly on enemies or to equip as stat buffers
its fairly easy to learn this system
however drawing magic over and over again and reequiping it constantly and also reequiping gfs can get rather tedious thats what knocks the point off the score
other than that the battle system is fine
i especially like the ability to pull the trigger on the gunblade using the r button it adds a level of fun interactiveness to the battlesgameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
lets see the first thing of note that comes to mind is the fact that enemies level up at the same rate as squall
that means that powerleveling is no longer desirable
this might be disappointing to some but i found it to be quite nice because the game isnt overly hard and i didnt have to waste time powerleveling
another point of interest is that you eventually get a way to avoid random battles which is awesome
another point is that there are plenty of minigames and sidequests of sufficient variety available to enjoy my favorite is the card game
so there should be plenty features here to please everyoneoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
i might have given this game a  instead of a  if i had reviewed it when i first bought it but now that ive played so many different rpgs over the years i realize what a treasure i really have in ff
this game really is awesome and i recommend it to all fans of rpgsthis is with final fantasy ix one of the best games on the saga it is full of good animations the stoy is excellent and it has a lot of hidden stuff that will keep you playing for hoursthe game might be old but it will keep you busy and for me this is the th time i play ita must have if you are a fan of this sagathis was a little different than other ff games
the battle system they use is draw from other characters and use them as you collect as many you get
graphics were great
story wasnt that bad
love squall lion heart
love the music soundtrack
i really spent more time playing cards in this game collecting them than playing side quest
the side quest is ok once you get squall last limit break
you can beat anyone in the game easy
well ultimate weapon at the end was kind hard
but theres ways to beat him without getting hit once
trade you cards to get hero potion that makes you take no damage
over all this game was pretty good
i have this still and still play this gamei love this game
ive probably played it  times at least
i think it has a story line that appeals to female players in particular which is nice to seeevery one always says  iswas the bestgiven changed rpgs forever but that doesnt mean cause cloud or aries isnt in  that it isnt goodi actually liked  and thought  would make for a better movie then  dideven though advent children was  outta im just saying i hate when people only go ohh s the best ohh  is in no way my fav but for a game that had to try and out due the hype that  broughthad i think it did a pretty good job and come on you gotta love rinoa fav final fantasy gamesff xff viiff ixff tacticsff xmy how times change
just twenty years ago the epitome of video entertainment consisted of manipulating a yellow blob around a crude maze gobbling smaller blobs for points
the goal was simple the play addictivetruly a game to be enjoyed by almost anyone
many moons later we have the same type of game albeit with far better graphics and sound but the concept is very similar run around a maze blasting enemies for points
pacman meet quakeunder the cosmetic differences my how they look the samebut times have changed and so has video entertainmentor games if you will
and the eighth episode of squaresofts popular final fantasy series has raised the bar yet again for this interactive pastime
one really has to give massive credit to the producers for introducing the element of romance into a media glutted with nonplot shoot em ups and simulators
but then squaresoft has never been conventional with every further chapter they seek to push the envelope resulting in extraordinary achievement and consequently the danger that the final product might not seamlessly gel together as it shouldsuch is the case here
final fantasy  arrived on these shores with so much expectation and hype that the actual result of the game itself was destined for mixed feelings of awe confusion and disappointment
the quality of the presentation could not be denied but these same innovations also highlighted certain flaws that another year of tinkering could have rectifiedthe central and dominate of ff would be the budding love between squall lionheart and rinoa heartly
other plottangents and themes abound rivalry war dark sorcery time compression abandonment issues the lust for power but romance remains at its core
squaresoft has done a fine job with this theme giving these two characters individual quirks and a powerful pathos that in the end brings a tear to the eye and a catch to the throat
the cold calculations of zeros and ones inspire actual human emotion feeling beyond cerebral enjoyment
ff was a risk worth taking and a risk that succeedsthe good the graphics  the visuals of final fantasy  are in a word stunning
the gorgeous fmv sequences pushed the psx to the limits of its capability and though the ingame graphics may suffer in comparison they are quite good in themselves thanks in large part to the design see below the music  in my opinion nobuo uematsus finest and most inspired work yet
the location songs are subtle and beautiful such as the melancholic chimes of balamb garden the resonating blue fields overworld theme and the acoustic strumming that echoes and shimmers through a seaside town
the opera strains of liberi fatali and fithos give import to characters and theme and the orchestration of the ending theme is truly magnificent
the design  fantastic
from the clean futuristic architecture of balamb garden the engrossingly melodramatic summons and the cool character renditions such as squalls cyberpunk gunslinger look this is the finest design output from squaresoft yetthe flawed lack of character development  unfortunately the emphasis on squall and rinoa leaves the other characters out in the cold
irvine selphie and quistis receive no further development past the first disc making each a bland cipher with nothing to differentiate between them other than limitbreak status
a shame really for it would not have been all that difficult to include sidequestssituations in order to booster their importance as done in ffff
ambiguous plotambiguous villain  the plot gets rather slow in the third disc the conflict ambiguous at best thus the tension lost
this is due in part to the lack of a concrete villain
kefka ff and sepheroth ff were great villains because through repeated interaction they grew into a monstrous status deserving to be dispatched by the end
the edeaadelultimecia quandary is a shadowy threat and the weak link to an otherwise strong storyline
however the last battle is an incredible experience well worth the overall effort
linear play  this is standard in any ff game and only becomes an annoyance in replay
not as bad as ff either
battle system  the drawsummon system has received its share of praise and criticism
i agree with the latter finding it tedious and boring
funny thing is you dont have to use itone can just limitbreak their way to victory
but by any method you choose ff is a very easy game though the standard plot convolutions guarantee  hours of playtimedespite these flaws i cannot give final fantasy  less than five stars because  it pushes the envelope a good thing in any form of media and  i enjoyed playing the entire game two times over
ff is a worthy addition to the final fantasy librarybring on ffok so final fantasy vi is still my favorite but i cant say enough about ff
the reason is that the story is incredible
i dont think i have ever played an ff game that has as well defined story as this
the romance between squall and riona is great
it actually got me involved and made truly empathize with the characters especially when squall rescues riona on disk   also the story of siefer and his oneman war against squall only heightened the drama as you go through the game
the portion about the orphanage was a bit hokey though i can understand where it fit into the rest of the storyline
but by far the best part is the love story
again i dont think i have ever seen an ff game that has as dynamic characters as this one
wow
i just cant say enough about it without giving too much of the story away
on a negative side this one still uses the d characters from ff as opposed to the overhead less realistic views that were common of the ff games i grew up on
and probably the most fun thing about final fantasy games is missing in this one you cant rename the characters and with ffx having voice overs with the characters names in them i guess that will never come back
but that was the most fun part renaming all the characters with your friends names
but still for playability this is one of the best editions out there and i just dont see how aside from general graphical improvements during the regular scenes it could be improved upon
this one is great
buy it play it and enjoy itff viii is hated because it is not ff vii
it offers amazing gameplay huge sidequests great graphics a cast of interesting deep intertwined characters and alot of optional material
all the different summons guardian forces and the abilites they come with alone makes the game thrilling
a must play for any rpg games concerned with plots and side quests
also you can get odin as asummon
i put it that way because once you get him he will randomly appear and kill every enemythis may be a bit late but i just felt like putting it up after replaying this game on my ps the real reason most negative comments are from ff players is mainly because of things like the junctioning system which takes some thinking to get it down the right way
when people say things like some parts are to hard or to easy it comes down to how smart you set up your junctioning system  and alot of ff fanboys dont understand it and never use it throughout the whole game and rely on nothing but gfs to kill their enemies since they dont get they can junction abilities to make squall very powerfull and annilate enemies with a few hits  the game is actually very easy if you junction abilities the right way  and you dont need money to progress really  you get  huge amounts of money you never use and really ff players dont understand the story eitherlol i must admit its a bit complex but ff fans just say the story is horrible instead of figuring it out
i think  ff players who really flame this game were hoping for something a little easier for them to understand and because they dont get it  all they do is just flame itthe story is actually quite beautiful away from the plot of ultimicia
stars over all for the story
 stars for fun took one star out just because its sometimes  hard to figure out your objective and spend time running back and forth from places if you arent listening to the dialogue it may take you awhile to figure out how to progress the story since nothing gives you hints on what to doby the way the game works perfect on the first pss released gigs and s i have no idea about the newer cheaper pssman
when i first heard about this game i was so happy
for one reason i loved the ff series and have played almost everyone
this one truely stands out as one of the best and diffrent ones
great graphicssoundcontroland fun factor
and now with its new low price anyone can own it
now i just cant wait for ffxi for psx and ffx and ix for ps  so do yourself a favor and buy this game
you will not leave your house for about  to  monthsas a girl obsessed with the likes of zelda the ocarina of time i was completely unfamiliar with turn based rpgs
when i recieved final fantasy  and  for christmas i naturally tried  first
i was horrified when i saw that you were unable to run around in a free roaming enviornment hacking and slashing at your leisure
waiting my turn to deliver one blow was not my idea of a good time
disgusted i removed the game and inserted ff
i was floored by the opening cinema
when the game started i was confused by all the new terms
seed
balamb gatrden
junction system
what the hell
but something compelled me to push onward
i was instantly hooked on the characters which to me are much more appealing than the lego characters of the previous final fantasy gamesyou play as the quiet lone wolf  year old squall leonheart a member of a group of mercenaries for hire known as seed
seeds reside in academys known as gardens
when an evil sorceress gains the trust of president deling and the people of galbadia squall along with fellow seeds the perky selphie tilmitt the loudmouthed zell dincht the ladies man irvine and the recently fired  year old instructer quistis trepe set out to assasinate her
along the way the lively and beautiful rinoa heartilly a member of a resistance faction known as the forest owls teams up with them
along the way she struggles to bring down squalls icy exterior and help him voice his feelings
the plot soon throws many curveballs eventually bringing forth issues such as romance possesion time compression prison abuse and escape and traveling into the futurei will admit that this game is extremely ambitious and has its flaws
the very different reviews serve to prove one thing it depends wholly on the person whether or not youll enjoy this game
some people enjoy the game enough to get by its flaws and appreciate its differences while others simply dont have the time or patience for it
it depends on your personality
before buying you must understand thatthis is a love storythe junction system attatching magic to stats such as strength and hp to raise or lower the stat depending on magic type and quantity takes a long time to understand and get fully confortable with
no other ff has had a system like this and you may not like ityou need to play through four discs and have the time to put in upwards of  hours in order to get through everything the game has to offer
patience is importantwhile i am an impatient person who gets put to sleep by other rpgs i enjoyed final fantasy  a lot
the characters meant something to me because they were realistic looking and typical teens rather than lego people with absent mouths
this is the black sheep of the series and not everyone will appreciate it
in my case it will always remain a favorite
for its time no game was more gorgeous looking and emotional and no final battle was as long and intense
the stunning ending clocks in at around a half hour
but some people arent bothered by the long frequent gf summons and some are extremely bothered by them
i can understand it
as i said it all depends what kind of person you arespent many nights playing this game for hours
i cant tell you how much of an impact this game has made with my teenage years
the love story is amazing and the final battle is worth the price of the game alonethe characters are wellplayed and each have their own unique personalities
squall is the loner with a hidden strength selphie is a happygolucky flower child rinoa is a strong and determined fighter irvine is a jokester quistis is serious and calculated and zell never shuts upfrom prisons to deserts to forests to outer space this game takes you places that most final fantasy games have never done previouslythe battle system is great i love drawing magic from your foes and stockpiling it like crazy
the gf and junction system takes several hours to get used to and you probably wont fully understand it until youre halfway through the game and adding critical attributes to your characters statsif you are looking for a fantastic game to pass time and to engage you in the storyline final fantasy viii is a sure betfinal fantasy viii combines a fantastic story amazing visuals and excellent sound with solid rpg gameplay an eminently tweakable junction system and scads of secrets and extras
cast all fears aside this final fantasy is one of the greatest game ever to bear the name
jody bissooni beleive that this is quite possibly the best game ever created
for one the graphics are the best playstation has ever seen second the gameplay is incredible and third the story is by far the most complicated yet enjoyable everthe story launches off with a teenager named squall who is training to become an elite soldier called seed in an a huge place called gardenas the story gets more complicated the less dedicated rpg fan might give up and put the game away but that is just when it gets good
everything clears itself up and there are even hidden secrets and twists that not too many catch at the end of the gamefor me it took me two times playing through to fully understand and enjoy it but it was worth it in the end
however towards the middle of the game it becomes rather easy as your options for level up and magic are virtually unlimitedsidequests are great in number and require much brain power and the games added bonus is the fmv sequences
breathtaking graphics it is hard to imagine the ps could handle such images as this game produces but it does and we all love itover  years old this game is still great
the story graphics and gameplay are even better the ff  and ff  it is a long and exciting game that any fan of rpgs will lovei absolutely loved this game
this is an excellent rpg and i just love it
i really love the final fantsays and have played  and i love this one the best out of them
the battle system is very fun to work with and the junctioning is fun to do also
it makes you feel good when you work with the junctioning and you get it right and the persons stats really improve
the gfs also are fun
you aquire them in a way that seems very literal and you attach them and have them learn thigns which is fun too
card games are really fun too once you get the hang of it
the second time i played it i said to myself quotno more card gamesquot
but i ended up playing them anyway and beating all the members of the cc group
it is just a great gameeveryone else may love ff but my first final fantasy was eight and boy did it suprise me the first time i played it
the cgi cutscenes are some of the most incredible in that era of d almost close to modern standards
the story was quite interesting as you find out your past and the past of the people around you the future becomes more and more interesting
i was super happy when i found out i could get a new copy of it from amazon for only  bucks what a deal for a game thats as old as it isthis game is pretty good and is very different from previous final fantasies
the equipment system from previous games is almost completely gone and has been dwarfed by the new magic and summon systems
its tricky and somewhat difficult when you first start out but it gets easier
the storyline can be a bit confusing though which can take away from the fun
some features are missing from the psone version too which also takes away from the fun but a cheat device can easily fix that problem
its still fun though despite its shortcomingsi liked this game
i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was okonce again i have to completely disagree with the cons of the amazon review
the battles are different from other final fantasy games but its certainly far from being boring and the random encounters are certainly not too much
its really sickening to read this stuff all the time
but i wont dwell on thisi really love this game and love how unique it is and how different it is from other final fantasy games
i remember when i first played the game it was a little intimidating at first because i didnt understand the whole draw system and drawing of magic and how you had to manage your stats with the magic you got from the drawing
but i became pretty good with it pretty quickly and now i love it
this game also punishes you for leveling up your characters since the enemies level up with you
i find this just as awesome as leveling up in other games since it really takes no more time to draw magic than to grind
a lot of battles i am in for close to an hour since im drawing of magic but to me thats nothing to complain about
i love itthis is an epic love story and feel squall and rinoa belong together
the music and areas and sidequests are so awesome
i love the different chocobo forests and riding the chocobos
i love the whole city of esthar and theres just so many things in this game
i love how on the world map itself you can draw magic from draw points and you can see these cool trains going around and disappearing into a tunnel
the world map itself is a sight to behold let alone the rest of the game
i love the airship you get to control and all the different areas you go to
oh and its so awesome with the summons in this game
all the summons each have their own abilities that they can learn which is really an awesome addition to this game
oh and odin is my favorite summon and you cant summon odin but when you do see odin come into battle its so awesome because you actually hear his horse
its so creative
the sidequests and minigames are so fun
an epic storyline and seeing all the characters develop throughout the game
of course the music is some of the best in the whole series
this is what final fantasy is all about
just so many amazing things
its so underrated
a must buy for final fantasy fans and rpg fanspeople who dont like this game should stop playing games altogether
it excels in graphics music gameplay and story
i have to play it every month just to hear the great music and to play the addictive card game
maybe its not the best rpg ever but its darn closenow i love ff but to me it lacks the fantasy feel there is way too much tecnology no fantasy
and basiclly gonning to a school and killing a socceres what you could expect
but it is still a game you should consider buying although the junction system is confusing at first it becomes easy to use and very handy for making youre charactors battle ready
the battles are very fun though and sometimes the story may get intressting and you find youre self with a bag of chips and ff for hours
but sometimes it can be drab and boreing and slow and puzzle after confusion
but this game has what it takes to be a rpg and a good game
try renting it first some people like it and some dontproscharacters  squalls quite strength is a great ying to rinoas outgoing yang
edia is a lush bad girl whos face alone will astound yougraphics  top notch and as good as ff ix
many have rewatchabilityscore  fitting music but over time the battle theme starts to get to you you can always play on mute thoughplot romance  i actually cared about squall and rinoa getting together in the end and if you know me im not big on that sentimental plot battle  edia is a surprise to say the least
it really makes you want to winconssystems  im supposed to understand this how
that tutorial is as helpful as sunscreen in the winter in washingtonfinal fantasy  is about squall leonhart and his companions as they become a part of a struggle to stop evil from destroying the planet
the graphics was great and looking better than final fantasy  the sound was awesome
the leveling up system is the same where you fight and level up but a new junction system is introduced for enhancing the characters statuses
for my opinion the junction system is annoying and helpful in a way but you will see what i am talking about when you play the game
the story is great and will make you dwell in it
so get this game and you will enjoy itall the final fantasys have a plot
this one is based all on love
you will meet a girl named riona i think because i named her julia
you will go on some interesting adventures and kill all the evil that lurks around
your goal in the game is to beat it of course which is a real challange because its  discs long
there are also sevral fmvs or movie cinematics
they take up alot of the game
but the graphics are so incredibly good when you fight monsters
when you summon guardian forces the graphics on them look so incredibly goodfiancee wanted so got it for him for christmas
had played it as a child and loved it o wanted to play again
he didnt put it down for days till he finally beat it
still goes back and plays more every once and awhile
highly recommendedim having the most fun ive ever had on playstation
i highly recommend it
best rpg everi lost this game a long time ago and thanks to amazon i now have it again
i love this gamei hate to admit it but i used to think final fantasy was just a  hackandslash series
i finally did some research into the series and was  amazed by what i read about ff
i went out and bought a copy right away to  see what it had to offeri was extremely impressed
usually games offer  something to adults or to kids but rarely do they get a combination that  intrigues both
this has a training system that makes you figure out which  kind of fighter you wish to be what you want to earn points towards how  you want to talk to people and which of your friends make the best allies  against a certain situationin addition an embedded card game series is  quite complex almost chess like
often we were hard pressed to beat some  of their masters but winning the games brought great advantages going  forwardthe combat and movement wasnt arcade like where you had to hit  the joystick just right in spot a to hit the enemy in spot b it mostly was  figuring out the right combination of healing attacking and defensive  spells to cast to keep your party alive while taking out the enemy
there  was little if any blood and gore
the aim of the fights was to outsmart  your enemy not to hack ribbons of flesh off of itand did i mention the  cinematics
the dance scene in particular stands out in my mind as  completely amazing
i would restart there on purpose to see the detail they  put into the movements
if you love good animation you could buy the game  just to go from scene to sceneif you enjoy role playing and graphic  adventure games at all id highly recommend this one
it does truly have  something for everyonethis game was infused with love and mystery
definately my favorite addition to the series so far
even though it is a regular playstation game it is well worth the buyif you liked final fantasy  youll like this game
youll play some then learn some more of the storyi own final fantasy and tactics and i have to say that ff is my favorite one because i love the stroydont know why others hate it i think it was magnificentthe charicters and the battles were amazingwhen i finally complted my collection i was going to play them in ordertactics would be lastafter beating  i was so exited to get to  i skipped  and played  after beating  i continued playing in order
ok back to the game its awsome great musicstorycharictersbattles i highly recomand this game to all who play video games
ps i am on  in my qiust to beat all ffs in order final fantasy  rocksi had never played ff before and i wasnt sure about number  but i thought i would give it a try
it is without a question the best game i have ever played
i love this game
the chars
are well defined and the monsters are challenging and creative
this was a great game that has lasted a long time with plenty of challenges and lots of funits eye opening to turn back the clock and play the old final fantasy games in the light of the remarkable production values of ff x  each game in the series set a standard for console and computer games that has changed the way todays player sees the rpg genrei originally played ff in the pc version so i was interested in how the ps version would compare
even with a my leaky memory my impression is that the ps version is a bit solider graphically
and of course the use of a game controller makes everything seem smoother even if it really isntff follows in the classic final fantasy mode  a team of characters headed by a serious minded leader with a bunch of slightly wacky but dedicated companions take on an evil that seems to keep getting stronger and more capable with each advance of the plot
no villain ever really seems to die the keep coming back in new and deadlier forms
and then there are the guardian forces who provide all kinds of spectacle for the battlesthis time it is squall his fellow seeds and the beautiful rinoa
the story starts as a revolution and then the characters discover that events are really being manipulated by a series of sorceresses who want to destroy the world so that they can rule it unchecked i know that doesnt make any sense
all of this on a giant world make full of monsters convenient for leveling upand leveling up is certainly what a final fantasy game is about
various side quests and challenges are provided so that reaching the levels needed to kill the final bosses doesnt become tedious and an incredibly complex character building system makes sure that everyones playing experience is differentff set a standard that is still higher than some games being written for the ps today and managed to accomplish that on a more primitive platform
graphics and character design are amazing the plot complex and the action satisfying
proving that the best isnt always the newest and the loudestfinal fantasy viii is probably the most maligned game in the final fantasy series
while many people loved the game many also didnt because of its overall change in direction and atmosphere
well regardless of how different it may be final fantasy viii is still an excellent game and belongs in every rpg fan and playstation owners collectionwhat makes final fantasy viii unique is that it shows squaresoft while still keeping the series at its basic roots is unafraid to tinker a little with its formula
first of all the storyline is quite a bit different from earlier final fantasies
it centers mostly on character development and keeps the basic goodversusevil plot while still an integral part of the game more in the background than in previous titles
the game also has a much more grown upmature feel than earlier games because of its more adult storyline and the discarding of the superdeformed characters of previous titles
once again the new direction square takes with the series works quite wellfortunately a great game still lies within the great storytelling
the junction system really isnt as annoying as people make it out to be
equiping guardian forces is a breeze and the admittedly cumbersome draw system of magic is tamed by the ease in building levels you only need  exp
per level as opposed to the varying number of required exp in previous final fantasies
and the battles while sometimes dragging on longer than necessary are generally enjoyable and interestingin brief final fantasy viii is an excellent rpg
i whole heartedly recommend it to fans of the final fantasy series as well as those looking for a nice change of pace within the rpg genrespoiler free reviewi first got final fantasy  as a christmas present back in  i remember at the time it was the game to have
i think i only ended up playing the game once then i threw it back in its case
after  years i finally picked it back up and decided to give it another try why i dont know
so what are my impressions of the game after  long years
well there are good and bad things about this game just like all games
when you first start playing the game the first thing you notice is the graphical images
the final fantasy team put a lot of time into the design of this game and even today its still prettyaside from the beautiful animations i found the game hard to get into
there is a lot of information that is thrown at you
when youre really just trying to understand what exactly is going on
it seems as though a lot comes at you very fast
its hard to grasp your role and how to play the game all at once
the junctioning system is by far the most difficult interface to learn
its odd to use and makes the game awkward at times
you have to draw or gain magic from defeating monsters
its time consuming but you dont really need to level up that badly until disk  so i didnt use the system really until i needed to
the fighting in the game uses what they call guardian forces or gfs
they are a neat idea but for a large portion of the game you dont need to fight you can just use your gf
this makes the game feel all too easy since the gfs usually destroy all enemies at once
the only true poor aspect of the gf is the scene time
they take almost minutes
to execute their moves and it gets old battle after battle not to mention makes fight time seem longer than it needs to bethe characters of the game are an interesting pairing but it feels like they never go in depth with them as they should
they have squall who is a loner quistis who is love hungry selphie who is adorable zell who is a bit goofy irvine whos the self proclaimed ladies man and rinoa dont get me started
squall for me was a realistic character
i liked him a lot mainly because i was just like him
squall likes to stay to himself because he doesnt want to open up to other people he is afraid of getting close to someone and then losing them
he felt that pain as a child and doesnt want to feel it again so he alienates himself from close relationships with the people around him
overall he is really a nice caring guy and he does care about the people around him but he is afraid of showing his emotionsso he doesnt
it is just easier for him that wayyou dont learn much about the other characters except rinoa who is squalls lover interest in the game
rinoa isnt exactly my favorite character since most of the time she is a damsel in distress and causes all attention in the game to be focused on her
the game made the relationship feel forced and you feel thrown into a love story
squall and rinoa never truly have a bond in the game but squall falls madly in love with her
from a realistic stand point quistis would have been the best match for squall
she was truly understood him she was mature and she actually went out her way for him
it just seemed odd that he would fall in love for rinoa whom he hardly had a chance to interact with
its the gaps in the plot like that that didnt make too much since to me like the writers didnt know how to carry out the character relationships which is a strong point in any love story
i guess for the player you never truly understand why squall falls so madly in love with rinoa
the game does a poor job at executing just why he cares for her so much all of a sudden and is willing to risk his life for heraside from the pot holed love plot there is the main plot which is fighting an evil sorceress edea who is actually pretty hot herself
the main story is also pot holed as well
you never get a chance to understand why the sorceress is doing what she is doing
you spend most of the game learning about the past and what led up to the current events but you dont ever learn the motives behind it all from the sorceressthis is probably the most puzzling part of the game
after you breeze through disk    you dont get into the real game until disk  disk  is when you release that you need to power up your characters
this is when you spend hours drawing magic searching for weapon parts fighting monsters and truly learning the junction system
i spent more time doing these tasks than actually playing the main plot of the game
this made the game feel stale and repetitive
this is probably what causes the game to be so bland for most people
its a tedious task to level up in this fashion
there also is a lot you can miss out on if you dont know what to do
i lost an important gf ability and weapon item just because of this this is a game that requires a guide of some nature to fully master it so be preparedoverall final fantasy  is a beautiful game with a shallow story that leaves the player with a lot more questions than answers however it is a final fantasy classic and a very beautifully developed game
sure it lacks some things here and there and the battle system can be a pain but when you see the  strike with  damage per hit lion heartyou cant help but sit back and smile and say hey this is pretty awsomea very much played game in the house
i bought this as a gift for the  kids and they love iti bought it because my big brother played it a long time ago
but he cracked all the games with his hand
after he beat them all
i guess he didnt want anybody else to play the games
they werent even his
he didnt buy them
but whatever now he cant do that to my gamesfinal fantasy vii might be a good game but i never could finish it
part viii on the other hand i have played time and time again throughout the years
its one of those games that i know ill always come back to and im going to tell you whynever before have i seen so many memorable characters in a single game
not just the main characters but even the characters you meet throughout your quest you will always remember
then of course there are the main characters rambunctious zell lady man irvine bossy quistis and the energetic selphie
they all play a vital role in the lives and story that unfolds with squall leonheart who for reasons unknown is at first a stolid unfriendly young man who sees dependency on others and self expression as weaknesses
this philosophy is probably what made him such a great warrior but when he is thrown into a leadership role he is forced to interact with others
his comrades with a lot of continuous effort work to bring him out of his shell but no one does this better than rinoa heartilly
distant as always squall gives her the cold shoulder throughout most of the game but despite that she keeps trying to win his heart
even the others do some pretty crazy things to get them together
some people dont understand why he suddenly changes from a battle hardened warrior to a loving caring man but to me it makes perfect sense when you come to know his past and why he chose to live a sheltered life for so many years
im trying not to give away much here but youre not going to see characters as complex as these in many video gamesfinally fantasy viii is a story within a story
at the same time squall is going on this journey of self discovery he and his army is at war with a sorceress that plans to wipe out the human race
simple right
wrong
there are so many insane twists in this game its bound to drive you nuts
just when you think you got it you realize you dont
but one thing for sure is that it is a good vs evil epic and you will love the many places you visit and the people you meet on your journeys across land space and timesome people hate the leveling system in this game but once you understand it its really fun to aim for perfect stats
basically you are required to hunt down these beasts across the world map that become guardian forces once youve defeated them in battle
sure you can summon them in battles but i never do that
i concentrate more on the junction options they give to your characters health physical strength vitality magic and endurance against magic
maxing these stats out to  each is real fun and challenging
combine this with hunting down extremely rare items during your travels so you can refine them into powerful weapons and command abilities and youre going to have your hands full for a couple of months
thankfully for some people you do not need to do any of this to play and beat the game but to me its another reason why i like this gamegraphics was revolutionary in its day and i think everyone regardless if they enjoyed final fantasy viii or not can agree that the game has a great soundtrackdid i mention anything about all the side quests in this game
at the beginning you are fairly limited with how much of the map you can explore but once you become more mobile you can walk away from your main objectives and discover new places that provide you with additional quests
this is how you will get the bulk of your guardian forces and some other lifesaving items
my favorite places were the deep sea research center the centra ruins in the wasteland of the centra continent and the shumi village in the northive played final fantasy vii and ix but i feel the characters are more believable in this one the drama is more serious the leveling system is rewarding and final fantasy viii has some of the most imaginative environments ive seen in any video game
in fact i feel this is the most imaginative game ive ever played shadow of the colossus comes close
at times when playing final fantasy viii i felt i was watching a real good science fiction instead of a fantasy
a lot of cool ideas were used in making this gameso what more can you ask for
good story memorable characters fun leveling system and unique creative environments
i will always come back to play final fantasy viii and if you havent done so already you are missing out on an unforgettable gaming experiencethis game is great anything else to say about it would just waste your time when you should be clicking the buy it now button i just bought this game yesterday and it rocks
the cg look just like the ones from ff x the only bad thing is the control in the game but i still give it five stars
cards are pretty fun except it starts to get more boringi would have to say this game isnt as good as ff x for ps which may i add is the best console out therebut its really closeif you do not have this game im telling you now to get of your lazy bottom and go get itput down that pop and  get the gamesquare really out did itself this time this game really is just a advanced version of ff in some areas but still has its flaws for instance squall acts exactly like cloud from ff except a little colder rinoa except for the blonde streaks on the sides of her head exactly like tifa
zell is flawless  his attitude the quotim too ignorant but im still gonna beat the crap outta youquot personality has never been introduced in the final fantsy series before so his characters personality is perfect
zells clothes very well designed the shorts the vest the muscle shaped breast plate armor his shoesgreat but too much red for me
zell next to cloud of ff and crono of chrono trigger takes first place above all other final fantasy characterslateryep first final fantasy introducing the king of cactuars
i agree with all the top star amazon reviews for final fantasy  so im just putting my two cents in to boost the rating
final fantasy  expanded on  and what do you get
plain awesomei have been a playstation final fantasy
i have never played the original final fantasys from nes and snes
this is possibly the best game i have ever played
the story was great and the graphics are by far the best on playstation
the music was amazing too and rivals many professional bands
zell was by far my favorite character he was so cool
the cg animations were the best part of the game though which had great pieces of the love story thrown in there
its amazing that a game could be so great
it was like watching a movie that i desperately wanted to finish
the gfs were the best from any final fantasy and have been brought into ff and ffx
the only bad part was how easy the bosses in the final tower were
i had cactuar and equipped zell with kamikaze and i just used that on every boss
i killed everyone but the final boss with it one hit
the hardest monsters were in the forest where you get ifrit and these were the tyrannosaurus rex type things
a great game with many different plotlines and an overall great gamei really love this game
its one of my favorite games of all time
it was the first rpg i ever played and loved every minute of it
companies dont make games this good anymorethis game features squall  a lone wolf that becomes a seed from balamb garden this garden educates people and trains them so that they can fight evil sorceresseswhile the story progresses squall stops being a lone wolfand eventually makes friends
when squall  and two more seeds have their first missionwhile being in the subway they pass out and have this dream about the adventures of three soldiers laguna  kiros and ward
as the game progressess these three characters turn out that they do exist and that that they play a very important role in the gameit also has two superbosses at the end of the game ultima and omega weapon  the last one being the most  difficult monster in the whole game and its optional to fight him
the best about this game  is that the ending is perfectanother great thing about this game is that that it has a lot of sidequests like in final fantasy x and x so that makes it a very long game mine in total has  hours of gameplayin conclusion you should buy this game i can assure you that that you will not regret itfinal fantasy   everyone was waiting
and when it finally arrived some were disappointed
others were not
everyone has their own opinion and thoughts but what it comes down to is one of the more controversial final fantasy games
some believe that square is losing it others say theyre simply making their games more serious
but in my opinion square was going for something new and they wanted to see how their followers would react
i personally loved the game from beginning to end
gone is the materia and mp magic system the characters resemble real people to a certain extent and the fun has been zapped outfinal fantasy fans may be upset or joyful either because they feel the final fantasy series is straying too far away from its roots or they wanted something new
this final fantasys them is love and it executes rather well
people say square took out the fun because of the absence of enough minigames and little extras such as the golden saucer and chocobo breedingracing that provided a break for those who were tired of leveling upthe graphics are great the characters actually look like people now
although they still have some unrealistic features i liked the anime kind of style that they had for the characters in ff
going on the fmvs are stunning
the best there is around  trust me the intro alone will make you weak in the knees
the gfs which ill get onto later look great especially leviathan and cactuar  
now everything seems to be more detailed with the monsters characters and even buildings
however the chocobos look somewhat different and there are no moogles at least none that i can recall in here whatsoever
 final fantasy  has some of the greatest music so far in the series in fact right now im listening to an orchestrated version of julias eye on me it really is a great song
ff definitely does not have the best music in the series but it can still hold its own when compared to the music of ff ff or ff
sometimes youll find a track or two to become extremely annoying and repetitive but just think youll live right
there are some tracks that youll remember such as eyes on me or liberi fatali but a few tracks of ffs music just didnt have the same feel as previous final fantasy gamesnoteworthy songspremonitionliberi fatalimaybe im a lionthe legendary beast omega weaponthe extremeeyes on medont be afraidif you liked the materia or mp system and hoped either one of them would return youll be unhappy to hear there is a new magic system that almost nobody likes
the new draw system has you sitting down drawing magic spells from your enemies until you have a suitable amount
yes it does get tedious and boring but youll really need the magic to help your character due to the junction system
there are also draw points here and there but they only help a little
i really hate the draw system and i hope its not going to be included in later final fantasy gamesthe characters in ff are fresh and new and the main character squall is kind of like cloud with that i dont care attitude except hes a loner and always has something on his mind
this is the set of characters youll remember besides quistis selphie and uh
irvine
for their charm humour zell and his hotdogs heheheh and great stories especially squall
theres a long story that has to do with all the characters that goes along these  discs there will be moments when itll make you cry if youre the emotional type ones thatll make you dance with joy and others thatll have you swearing at squall cause he didnt give rinoa a hugthe story is well thought out and it has quite a few strange plot twists
youll be sitting on the edge of your seat to find out what happens next because of ffs great story line
it starts off right from after the intro in which seifer a rival of squalls slashes squall in the face
squall is a student at the garden a mercenary school
hes very quiet and coldhearted
he does have a few friends who are quistis and zell
he and seifer are the top students at the garden and were always considered rivals
but change happens when squall meets rinoa on a mission a very interesting person with an optimistic attitude
she doesnt worry about anything and is friendly to everybody
at first squall doesnt really care but as the story goes on  things happen
and lets just say squalls world is turned upside down inside out and he doesnt really know what to do about it
a number of events occur as they learn more about the garden edea the sorceress and laguna
at first you may think this is your typical boy meets girl boy saves girl from big evil sorceress boy falls in love with girl but its really a lot more complicated than that
expect the unexpected and youll still be in for the ride of your lifeguardian force  without it youd be toast
well actually probably not
i went through the last quarter of the game without using a single gf
squall with  strength and a lionheart  doom for enemies
its simple  the last boss incredibly easy
my simple strategy is to cast mighty guard and then hack away at high speed  or stay at low health not too low and use endless limit breaks
but thats getting off topic  the gfs are your faithful companions theyre kind of like summons or espers shiva ifrit and some other classics are back yet again
and they allow you to junction the junction system completely gets rid of equipping armor etc read about it soon
magic to your attributes
the gf summons look fantastic the first couple of times and they do take up a reasonable amount of time but they start to get annoying
youll be sitting there frantically pressing the square button while watching your gf do the same move again and again
there are also hiddensecret gfs
the gfs can learn abilities from a long list including hp up new junction options new abilities such as recover revive etc
and other neat little things
imho the gf concept isnt the brightest idea in the world but it works out okaydid you like to buy equipment and little relics or accessories for your characters
well forget all that  instead is the junction system
you take your magic spells that you have and junction them to one of your many attributes such as attack speed defense etc
etc
to improve its rating
and the more spells of that certain spell you have  the stronger youll become
and different spells have different effects
so this means that when you use your magic your stats will go down
this is what i hate most about the junction system and the main reason i hardly used magic throughout the game
also you can junction to elemental defense and attack to give you a special raise or drop in offense or defense when facing certain enemies
then there is also status attack and defense junctions which allow you to have a defense against certain status changes or allow you to attack with a chance to give the enemy a status change
as for weapons you dont buy new ones instead you find certain items that the blacksmith needs to upgrade or remodel your current weaponthe card game  triple triad is squares answer to your minigame cravings
although i think people really wanted a bunch of simple minigames here and there triple triad is so deep and addictive youll forget about those minigames
there are hundreds i believe of cards to collect and you can battle almost anyone in a card game
there are different rules from different areas of the world so youll have a good challenge
and once you build up your collection of cards you can change them into items to help you upgrade your weaponsand now everyones favourite animal the chocobo
chocobo catching isnt as easy at all anymore youll find the chocoboy in chocobo forests wholl explain everything to you
you have two whistles the chocoziner and the chocosonar
you use the two of them to lure out the baby chicobos then after you find them all  the mother chocobo comes and you can ride it
i dont know of any races for chocobos but i think what you see is what you get
ive also heard of a secret chocobo area but thats the faqs job to explain  its the little things that people miss receiving money for defeating the enemies the materia and mp system simple yet fun minigames a bigger variety of characters any secret characters and more of a challenge
but theres also some little things that ff fans have embraced and enjoy
such as car rentals salaries tests of knowledge miniquests gorgeous fmv great characters a wellcrafted story line and the mighty moombasnow whether you like ff or not is your personal opinion but i love it from the stunning introduction to the spectacular ending which makes all of the bad parts of the game seem worth going through
i may not like it as well as ff but its still a final fantasy and everyone will remember this one
whether it was because of how horrible they thought it was or because of what a fantastic experience they had with it
sushis quick sheettradestoryline  i really like the story besides the few parts of it that i dont understandgameplay  the fighting system remains relatively intact but i think that limit breaks are a little too easy to activatecharacters  quistis selphie and irvine couldve used some more development but the others are greatmagic system  i really dont like the fact that whenever you use your magic you weaken yourselfcontrols  well uh theyre goodaudio  another batch of excellent tracks from nobuo uematsu himselfreplay  im hooked to the card game even though i always lose hehehoverall  it definitely lives up to final fantasys reputation
ratingsstoryline  gameplay  characters  magic system  controls  audio  replay   the card game heheoverall this game is not quite as good as final fantasy  but it is great game just buy it and enjoy
i pesonally played through it twice the first time  on my own and the second time using the official guide book it was great  both times throughthis is by far the best game in the ff series
you can take virtually any route that you see fit in character develpment and the customization is by far one of the most in depth and revolutionary systems to date
if you dont take full use of everything the game gives you then your experience will not be as fulfilling when playing ff
some people have complained about balance and having to rely on your gfs guardian forces too much
this is not the case at all because in ff you make your own balance in the way you junction your characters
i have beaten this game with minimal to no usage of my gfs or magiconly using regular attacks and limit breaks
it can be done and if you experiment with different spells status ailments and elemental junctioning then you will appreciate the very deep system that this game offersjunctioningfirst you have to be careful that you do not miss anything in this game
draw from everything you encounter early in the game because alot of early bosses have magic that you might not see for quite some time and those spells are the key to sailing straight through this game
the more spells you have of one kind determine the junctioning stats rate of effectiveness
for example if you have  fires junctioned to your str
and your str
is currently at  and you happen to draw  more the next battle your str
will now be at  because you have more fire spells in your inventory and you are currently junctioned to fire
this was just an example because if i can remember right the magic only increases the stats that theyre junctioned to by percentages
the most of any spell you can aquire is  but experimenting with different spells on different stats are better than choosing auto junction in which the computer does it for you without much diversity
 fulllifes on your hp works wonders thoughgfsalot of the gfs have some of the same abilities to start out with so pay attention to which one give you the abilities to junction certain stats
you will need to divide them up accordingly so that your whole party has even statistics so then you will be able to draw with them also
always leave one party member with a magic command though so you can use cures and draw with your other two
your gfs level up as long as theyre equipped to you even if you dont use them in battletry junctioning the spell zombie to your status attack and the use life to instantly kill alot of tougher enemies
have funfinal fantasy
doesnt hearing that name give you a chill down your back
well if not then you havent played number  i thought seven was pretty darn good but i was wrong
it is average compared to the mighty ff
i am twelve and love ps games but this is incredible
here is my score for it graphics  absolutely incredible
this would be good even on ps gameplay  come on
its final fantasy
lifespan   discs
 hrs
what more can be said
sound  the best ff music yet
brill
characters  couldnt fault any of them plot  better than ff
awesomeeven metal gear solid isnt as good as this
this is a master piece perecentage of  for ff fans and  for none ff fans
exceptional
magnificent
magic
i could go onok first off i cant get over how different the artwork here isits just so typically americantee heeanywaythis game would probably come second to best ff next to ff
although the junction system can seem very complicated that doesnt mean it is
its actually very simple you use magic to enhance your stats and resistencethats itthe summonings also known as gfs eidolons espers aeons etchave been made more complicated by making it so that you can use them to learn new commands like turning monsters into cards
however as a party you can become very dependant on these monsteres because it is so much easier just to watch them take off heaps of damage reagrdless of what you do instead of attempting to get a weapon upgrade
and watching the cutscene of them killing monsters over and over again can get tiring very quickly
what i do is only use them in boss battles and try and learn jatk as quickly as possible to increase your own attackyoull understandwhat this ff game is the first to do is create a card game
it is very addictive and is weirdly enough more advanced than the card game in ff mabye they were trying to go for simple addictiveness and trying to find every single card can sometimes absorb aaaaaaaaaaaall youre time until its gonebe carefulbuy it
then buy ff
what
youve already bought it
well then sell it and buy it againthis is a very good rpgthere are so many terrible reviews to this game even i dont know how many there arebut one thing is certainthis is a good rpgfirstmany people complain that the characters have no personalitynot only is this wrongbut i dont know who caresseconda new adjustment to rpgsthe characters dont use mpinstead they use the junction systemand the characters arent stumped with the same abilitiesthirdthere is less exp to earnonly  is requiredthough for most enemies it comes in no more than  per enemyprosnew junction systemvery longchallenginggood graphicsconssome parts arent as fun as othersso there you have itone more thingthis game has lots of little puzzles so i find it near impossible to beat the game with out a strategy guidebut thats gained on gamefaqscomas the eighth final fantasy this is easily one of the best
in this game you are part of a mercenary group called seed named squall leonhart
the game includes  discs each offering a good amount of challenge and excitement
there are  permanent characters and  temporary ones
but dont be fooled by this i havent told you all
i wouldnt say the music is as good as some games like chrono cross but it still recieves a fair score
the game is very long as you could guess with  discs and the replay value is high enough
the challenge is high enough to shock even some rpg veterans and the characters are easy to like
also there is no mpnow on to the games weak spots
one bad point in rpgs are the random battles
youd better be prepared to fight a lot of battles but you need to anyway because the gfs need a lot of points to learn certain things and the only way to get them is to fight and if you want good characters you need to fight and get experience points
but dont be fooled not a lot of areas beside the world map have random encounters
another weak point is that to get exp and ability points you will need to fight a lot of fights which can get quite tedious
but besides this i doubt you could easily find a game better than ffviii
it is an rpg that you shouldnt avoid even if you never played too many rpgs or arent extremely good at video gameslet me start off by saying that this is one of the best games ive ever  played
the graphics and fmvs especially the intro
are outstanding and  the storyline is engrossing intricate and complex
some people dont like  the new junction system well squaresoft was trying to put something  different in the game so it wouldnt play as ffvii with materia
and the did  a fine job with that
money is not of great importance in this game as  ffvii but you do get a lot of it throughout the game
the main character  has a cool weapon the gunblade which is very original and it has much  more power than clouds big quotaxequot this game has some great music   arguably the best ever in any rpg
the theme song quoteyes on mequot  is a memorable and romantic tune that will easily catch your ear
overall ffviii is an incredible game with a lot to it
theres a lot i  didnt mention but youll figure it out
ffvii wasnt a bad game at all
both  have their originalites and ups and downsthey can make as many ffs they want but this one will always be my favorite even with less graphics then todays ff this one blows them out the waterthis game is beautiful
superb graphics for their time great story full of twists and drama vast world to explore and so much morethis is the best game i have ever playedi love this gamethis is a must buy gameits the best roleplaying game everits the awesomest gamea must buyif you love ff games or just any rpgs this game is definetly for you
every part of the game combined makes it one of the best video games not just rpg or ff of all times
this game is a spectacular one that you just want to play over and over againi loved this game right off the bat the first time i played it
it has a really good beginning awesome music and graphicx that are a step up from final fantasy  tho ff was a huge step up from the previous games
so heres what i have to say about the gameit is a long game
you dont need to do everything obviously but  hours is not an unrealistic expectationthe story is a little confusing because theres a lot of timetravel talk about people going to the future to stop a sorceress who goes into the past possesses another person from the characters present and yeah
but its good
also its a good love story if you ask meits right up there with the stories of ff and ffyou dont use mp
instead you draw magic and occasionally summon monsters from enemiesyes the summon scenes are longbut thats because the game is giving you the chance to boost the monsters attack
i think you hold select and rapidly press square watch the box in the corner and stop when theres an x in the boxbut dont quote me on thatthere are a lot of random battles and they do get a little annoying after awhilethe boss fight music is awesome
actually all the music in this game is awesome
except sometimes the regular fight music
ive found myself stopping playing the game just to hum along with the music
not a good strategy for a boss fight p but it seriously is that goodthe characters are pretty well done their costumes are neat and not too outrageous and theres a pretty good level of humor throughout the story too even during the end scenes
so if you have never played this game i seriously suggest you give it a try
thank you for reading thisi cant stress enough how good this game is
i own  copies because i have lost discs over the years
the story is the best part
the graphics and cut scenes are gorgeous
the music goes perfect
the love story really pulls you in
i really could sit here and list a million things about this game but theres not enough time in the dayi love this gamewow
this rpg is  disk long
i started playing it and the beginning was a little slow like most but it picks up like crazy
this is one of those rpgs where you have to pay attention to even the random battles
great overallbut in spite of that final fantasy viii is an undeniable classic
the longest game in the series number  is one of two that i have been able to beat along with number 
the game spans across  epic discs though as usual the final disc is rather short
in each disc there are all sorts of lush bit landscapes and characters as well as gorgeous summons and various other magic spells
the cg cinematics are stunning especially the ending
the character designs are new to the series which is great it was the first with the more adult looking characters that also stylized number  parts one and twoalso the musical score though not as good as the one in vii is gorgeous
the battle music for both bosses and regular monsters is beautiful while the monster battles have more of a classical sound strings leading in to a brass and wind attack while the boss theme is more of a synth rock tune with rhythm guitar chugging away beneath the keys
the final battle music is beautiful as is the music in the final level ultimecia castle
in fact the music in ultimecia castle sent chills down my spine when i first heard it it is very creepy with the organs blaring and the harpsichords beneath it
the bottom line it doesnt have as wide of a variety of characters as many other final fantasy games do but it has an eerie and atmospheric musical score that only final fantasy vii can beat
buy it if you enjoy the series especially vii and all the games after itfinal fantasy viii is a great revisit for fans of the series or anyone playing it for the first time
this game is one of the favorites of many fans thanks to the storyline
the battle system is similar to other entries in the systemive been waiting to get this game for so long i remember my sister playing this years ago now i finally own a copyeveryhting was in the case including booklets the disks seem to be resurfaced because they dont have a scrath on them i tried contacting the seller because i hadd someone else order it for me but i never got reply i just wanted some info but everything seems to be great i wopuld highly recommened this guy since im assuming he does the resurfacing himself so your disks will be in great condition but make sure you check the description of what you are buyinggreat final fantasy game and a piece of gaming history must have for all fans and collectorsgreat final fantasy game and a piece of gaming history must have for all fans and collectorsgreat final fantasy game and a piece of gaming history must have for all fans and collectorsi bought this game thinking that it was going to be the best game ever
gone are the cartoon and deformed bodys of cloud and co and with new  graphics which are absolutly amazing but really its just characters  moving on an oil painting background
id seen screenshots and heard  various new systems and controls about the game and differences from its  predecesor
the graphics are fantastic gameplay exceptional and the  storyline is also quite good
the addition of renting a car along with the  staying in hotels are present and give the game a realistic feel
you can  pick up various magazines around the world with different info in them
the  game is a worthy challenge for any gamer and there are plenty of secrets to  uncover and gfs to find aswell as nonability gfs and cards to collect
there are plenty of hard bosses including the formidable ultima and omega  weapons the latter providing an exceptionally hard challenge indeed
the  story is spread over four discs and you get sucked in and addicted easily
it is a fantastic effort by squaresoft
youve probably by now heard all  the great stuff about the game from other reviewers
however i and some  of my mates feel that this game dosnt have the same atmosphere as final  fantasy vii
first of all there are only six characters and all are met in  the first disc which takes away the oppurtunity to explore and discover  secret characters like yuffie amp vincent in ffvii
also all the  characters are humans whereas in ffvii you had a dog a mog and other  characters who all had different backgrounds unlike the characters in  ffviii who are all seeds except rinoa
some might say that the draw  system is better and in a way it is as is junctioning magic
however you  dont manage to pick up new abilities like you did with the materia such as  final attack and mime etc
ffvii drew me in more and i was more tempted to  play it that with this one
the atmosphere of wutai the slums the  forgotten city cosmo canyon and the icicle area are gone and you have to  deal with second rate places such as shumi village and edeas house
esthar deling dollet and balamb keep the interesting adventure feel up  for a while but timber winhill and the previously mentioned places let the  side down
midgar was massive
you spent about  hours in there at the  start of ffvii yet you most you really need to spend in anyone place in  this game is about an hour
there is no new armour to buy or any  accessories to obtain in crates hidden in caves and the sub quests are very  little rewarding
there is no more raising breeding and racing the  chocobos
the card game is an excellent and well thought up addition but  there are no other sub games such as bike chases and snow boarding
overall this game is one of the best games ever
i suppose its just a  matter of opinion
some people will prefer ffvii and some will prefer  ffviii
i have given this title  stars but its more of a case of ffvii  getting  stars and ffviii getting  stars
compared to the rest of the  video games out there this just blows away the competiton
but i dont  think that the gameplay is quite up to the standard of final fantasy vii
fansll love it thoughthis game is a great game
even being an older game it is probably one of the best games i have ever played
it has a great storyline and an interesting level up and junction system
it is a fun game that i would recommend to anyone especially a final fantasy fanbought the game when it premiered  yrs
ago and needed a new copy still better than some modern games
i think it will always be a classici still remember getting this game on  the day it came out
i love this game because of its junction system and some of the other cool features in this game
unfortunatly from all of the people that i knew people either hated the game most of those people are on this side of the lovehate group and a few people loved it extremly hardcore rpg fans seem to love it
i love the game but this is the final fantasy game that a whole lot of people just cant stand
it is a long game especially if you get stuck so a guide internet or actual guide i dont care will really help
it is the easiest game to literally reach level  because every  exp gets you a level up but using the junction system is also an important role in the game because it can raise your stats as well
this is a game that you will have to play for yourself
before you agree with the haters give it a spin pleasebought this to let my much younger siblings get a chance to play the games they watched me play when they were very small
they loved them
hope they dont destroy them while i am gone as i love them tooi have read several reviews stating how the game was to overly complicated and too focused on graphics and not story
i have been playing rpgs for  years and i simply love this game
i was hooked to this game the minute i got it
the story will draw you in and wont be able to put it down
the storyline developes very well
the graphics are gorgeous and the cutscenes are jaw dropping
the absorb ability that is in place of magic takes  bit of getting used to and confused me through the first part of the game
but once getting the hang of it it works pretty well
with interesting characters and nonstop action i highly suggest this to any person who had doubts of this game before
just as good as ix i still firmly belive final fantasy iii on snes is the best in the series   this game warrants a purchasei first found out about ff from the tv commercials that were in heavy rotation when it first came out
it looked great and i heard it was an unprecedented discs long
for some reason i never got around to buying the game until the price dropped to 
i then bought it for  and the official strategy guide for a sale price of only 
i was amazed
ive played this game  times
which is more than ive ever played any other rpg
so you already know the replay value is immense
now for the breakdown reviewgraphics  ff abandoned the cartoonish look of ff and squaresoft opted for more realistic looking graphics
some of the scenes in this game could give some early ps games a run for their money
the gf animations are crisp and clear and the characters look much better than ffsound  ff had an incredible soundtrack that enhanced the gameplay and made that game even more memorable
ff is no different
i truly have to thank nobuo uematsu for all the hard work time and effort they put into this games soundtrack
even the introduction music is stellar
at times i would find myself humming some of these tunes in my headgameplay  this is where some have complained about ff
obviously the gameplay is different from ff and as you already know squaresoft dramatically changes the gameplay with each ff release
sometimes its for the better as it is here and sometimes it just doesnt work ff
materia has been replaced by gfs or summons
each character relies on them for abilities and what not
stats are increased by leveling up and by junctioning magic to certain stats
magic must be drawn from enemies or various draw points
mp has been eliminated and replaced by the draw system
gf abilites are learned by attaining ap from enemies after battles
the actual battles are almost the same as ff except limit breaks can be used only when a character is near death or when he or she uses an aura spell whereas in ff they were charged as the character takes damage
the difficulty level of this game was too much for some gamers
enemies get stronger as your characters get stronger rather than certain areas containing different level enemies
i personally loved the difficulty level
ff became too easy around disc  and ff was way too easy throughout
the sidequests were more challenging than the other titles as well
this game was a great challenge for me and i loved it
another great addition to this game was the triple triad card game
this was an incredible minigame throughout the whole game
even after youve beaten everything you can still have fun playing triple triad
squaresoft should make the next online ff title have an online version of this card game
the only drawback to this game is the number of things you can do inside the cities
the cities themselves are vast and much more detailed than ff but the problem is that there are few places you can actually go to in the cities
on ff and ff you can go inside item shops houses and other various places
even the massive city of esthar only has about  places you can actually go inside ofstory  i dont want to spoil too much of the story for those who havent played or beaten the game yet
ff had a critically acclaimed storyline
the storyline for ff is great as well
the story will seem boring through much of disc  but by the time youve gotten to disc  they heat up other than the horribly boring event at trabia garden
at that point in the game i was hooked
i came home from school everyday just to play this game
youll find yourself always wanting to know what will happen nextreplayability  as i stated above it is incredible
i played this more than any other ff titleif youre an rpg fan then you probably already have this title
then if youre one of those people who are afraid of the effort required to play an rpg youll feel differently after playing this one
i recommend this title to all gamers except for the weakminded ones the ones who complained that this one is too hard
you may get bored in the beginning but by disc  you wont be able to stop playingas far as im concerned not many games ive played hold a candle to final fantasy vii
that was my first rpg experience and an experience it was
final fantasy viii now is right behind vii as it broke the mold with square did with their previous final fantasy games
one of the things some people may really hate is the junction system where you have to draw magic from enemies and stock it up in your inventory or cast that magic on the enemies you draw them from
ill be honest i hated this thing when i first started playing but after all the hours of drawing and drawing magic it actually grew on me and gave the game that different dimension i hinted at earlier
overall this wasnt a bad idea by square but it also wasnt the bestthe most important thing that came out of this game was my favorite vidgame character of all time in squall lionheart
this guy will really annoy you with his me against the world type attitude but as the game progresses youll see what i thought was great character development
also he has the sickest ultimate limit break ive ever seen
and the fact that you can use the r button when you slash an enemy with his gunblade gives the game a bit more of an interactive feel
the same goes with boosting your guardian forces summons with the square buttonlong story extremely short this is a love story that i thought was well executed
although it is done in a way that some of you may just flat out hate the game
there is no middle ground i think on this game
you either do love it or ya hate it
im down with the formersomehow having played as many games as i have the experience of playing this one stands out
the love story all the finalfantasy style extras like finding all the gfs the silly fact that nearly half the game takes place in what in reallife terms would best be described as a school i dont know what it is but something makes me hold this game in higher regard than any other game since lufia i and ii and super mario if you are like me you will play this game several times through each time  hours or more and you will literally never forget it
ive done all this and there is still some quest involving things you can search for on the map screen that i am intrigued by and have not successfully completedmost rpgs engross me lend me enjoyment then pass from my mind within weeks after i complete them
but not this onei love this gamegoddamn i love this game
its not even that good but im so in love with it
just let me say phenomenal soundtrack
this music is goddamn incredible
i bought the soundtrack separately because its so good
other than that classic final fantasy with some new twists
junction system is fun but can be boring if youre trying to beef up your characters
monsterlevel scaling makes leveling up pointless so you are forced into the boring draw system to get good junctions
other than that the gameplay is fun the story is pretty good up until disc   the story isnt so bad on disc  but there is much less fighting and a lot of talking
and then disc  s just goes haywire and nothing makes sense really and everything is cheesy and weird
still super fun to play throughout and the music like i said is always incredible
definitely worth a play if you are a final fantasy fan
ive played through the whole game upwards of  times and enjoyed it each timea lot of people gave ffviii bad press when it came out and i can still see bad reviews here now i have no idea why
comparisons to ffvii are obviously going to be made in my opinion it falls marginally short of vii but only slightly not as much as some people suggest it is still one of the greatest games everwhere it falls short of vii is the plot which just isnt as good mainly because you dont meet the final boss until the very end of the game also a criticism of ix
she really has little to do with the game until the closing hours and it could have been thought out a little better
as for the main character squall he is a little stereotypical for the genre an angst ridden teenager with many personal issues not original but it still works
these are only minor criticisms and on the whole this game like its predecessor is amazingit is longer than ffvii it will probably take you at least  hours to complete this and thats ignoring the many distractions on offer
the best subplotgame is definetely triple triad the card game which is genious
i wasted at least  hours on this alone and on my second time playing through the game i completed the collection which was hard work but very satisfying if you have the time
everything about this game is class the locations the characters the new junctioning system everything
i have heard a few people say the junctioning system is too complicated but it isnt really
it can seem like overload at first but once you have the hang of it it works really well
there are also secret bosses like in all ffs i defeated both ultima and omega weapons after a very drawn out battle
there is so much to see and do here like most of the games in the series it is a masterpiece very highly recommendedi have all the final fantasy games except for viii
i just never got around to getting it
i purchased viii two months ago and i have currently beat it
i though it was well worth playing
the storyline was great
each charcter brought something spectacular to the game
i never put it down
the ending alone was worth it
 of  for the best story and gfstrinitygreat series of a great role playing game 
get the series for extended play
great for kids  to this game is very in depththe detailing of story is so great its as if youre playing someones life
plus there is a really cool card game on itthe animation is very sweet aswell with awesome action suspense and guardian force animation
this game is a must have for any rpg gamer one of the greatest games of all time definitely a must buy if youre a fan of role playing gamesthe characters are well developed the story line is great and the animationgraphics are awesome
some of the fmvs full motion videos are simply amazing i could just sit there and watch them over and over
quotfinal fantasy quot is an excellent addition to the final fantasy tradition
i dont remember how many hours i played this game but every single minute was worth it i wasnt bored once
one thing i really liked about this game was that the final battle could actually be kind of challenging especially the first time you try when you have no idea what is going to happen
this game was a lot of fun and i would recommend it to any fan of the seriesfianl fantasy viii is my favorite out of the series
its a really fun game with a great storyline and realistic characters
its a long game so people who dont have much patience this game isnt worth picking up
know that its may take you up to  to  hours to complete
the only thing thats bothers you in the game is random battles sometimes after completeing a battle youll move less than an inch and your back in another battle
some people may find it hard since as your levels go up its gets tougher unless your know how to use the gf battle systemmercenaries was the bridge battletech game  it combined the action of mw and ghost bears legacy with the offbattlefield logistics that were further honed in later titles
but mercenaries was the first and thus is rightly held in high esteemthis is the best of the mechwarrior series
i own them all so shouldnt i know
you get to choseyour career as a commander for a mercenarie unit or join someone elses
then you sign contracts to get your missions
id nominate this game for quotbest pc gamequotbut i canti havent played this game since i was  and i miss it so muchnow nobody in my family has a  weve all got xps so i cant play it anymorewaaaahhh
oh well hey mech freaks if you put the game in your cd player or at least the titanium trilogy edition of the mechwarrior  games it plays music maybe its just my copy but its awesome
i love this game to deathmechwarrior mercenaries is the very first game ive ever played in the series long before i started reading any of the books
needless to say i was unfamiliar with the whole plotmwmercs puts you in the cockpit of awesome powerful ton humanoid warmachines with enough firepower to level a citythis is one of the few fps games that kept me glued to the monitor from beginning to end
well worth the moneythis game like most star trek games had a slightly troubled launch
there were two main bugs  first the default game speed was too high though the game has a speed adjustment so you can play it from the fastest setting almost like a fighter sim  or the lowest which would put even the most hardcore battleship sim fan to sleepthe big bug upon release was the ramem enemy ai
the enemies would inevitable ram you
the official patches fixed this almost immediately though and the game became totally playableon modern oss youll have a few issues since the game was written in an earlier version of directx which nvidia no longer provides support for in their video card drivers
so  if you have an nvidia card and a recent driver version there will be graphical corruptionyou need to do a search using your favorite search engine for klingon academy wrapper
and youll get the best results if you also include the term jiridvorak in your search by the wayif you do that youll find the multhread crash fix which isnt necessary if you know how to use the microsoft application compatibility toolkit but is very helpful if you dont
 the high resolution enabler fix im running this at  x  resolution and finally the rendering fix which allows the program which uses an old version of directdraw to run on a newer system with a newer version of directdrawimplement all three and i can say for certain that this will run on windows xp any version or windows  ultimate
the game itself  its a blast
it is my favorite waste some time game  nothing like a little oneonone slicing up an enemy starship one subsystem at a time
take out the impulse engines first to make the enemy less manueverable  or pull the teeth by destroying weapons systems first  or blow up the warp engines to prevent the ship from escaping
if its a cloakable ship take that out first of course
target the shield generator which is very difficult and if youre still alive youll be able to pick your enemy apart with impunityprobably my favorite part of this game is the rather unique user interface
it is called the verbal orders system
and in my case i use a voice command software package an older one called game commander though there are newer and more capable examples out there today which allows me to command the entire game by voice should i choose toyou are the captain of the ship and you have bridge officers who are each responsible for certain tasks
you first select a particular officer and then you give that officer a command
if youre playing with the keyboard it would go like thisengineerpress set impulse engine speedpress to press of course with a true voicecommand system you can just say engineer set impulse to one half and this happens behind the scenes
i love playing that waythere are certain things you can directly control if you choose to steering the ship setting speed firing weapons  and sometimes youll need to do that but most of the time i choose to play as captain meaning i give orders and each time my subordinate responses appropriate to my order both verbally and with their actionsits about as close as youll ever really get to commanding a starshipthe graphics are quite acceptable though remember that this is an older game so dont expect total photorealism as youd likely see if the game was released today
the voiceacting is fine ingame though no matter which race you play as in multiplayer or skirmish youll still hear the klingon crew voice actingthe campaign  which is broken into two main segments  is terrific as a work of fiction not just as gameplay though it works quite nicely for that too
while most games with integrated video always felt hacked together the video in this one is not only helpful but totally immersive
this is in large part due to the masterful acting of the two lead actors who reprise the characters they played in star trek vi  the undiscovered country this game is set prior to that film by the waythe plot is deep and theres a lot of gameplay involved this is not a one afternoon game by any stretch
each mission is extensive and there are something like twenty five missions
if you play one a day which is about all im up for theyre exhausting most of the time
 itll take you a month to finish the game which is good value as far as im concernedas far as the plot goes there is some limited branching involved but its not a true freeform universe
its a partially freeform universe there are a lot of systems to visit not just the ones in the game proper and if you do so you can find all sorts of interesting things that youll miss if you only play the game straightup
for instance  theres another doomsday machine out there somewhere  seriously  this game represents the pinnacle of star trek game publishing
this and elite force the first one not the sequel though the sequel wasnt bad by any stretch are the two best star trek games ever producedthis is still available  buy it while you can
dont miss your chancewithout a doubt klingon academy is the academy awards winner of the star trek games
interplay should come out with a sequel and call it klingon academy  please keep the same interface controls
could make millions
thank you romeo h faisonthis game is absolutley awesome
my friend burned a copy for me and ive been addicted ever since
the last guy is so hard i still havent beaten him
the graphics and sound are amazing
the guns are cool the enemies  are inteligent the game is phatso much to say so little space and time
quake embodiesthe greatest deathmatch action period
for me this is the best gamearound
i will give you some pros and cons for this game
first the pros the graphics engine is top notch
written by the man himself john carmack it possess the best graphics engine created up until carmack creates his new engine
unreals engine does come close but i believe the quake engine would win in a duel of engines
i just hate the water effects in the quake engine
 the player models are the best
period
there are models for everyones tastes monsters humans oneeyed cyborgs the whole  yards
each one has its own animation and sound
very cool when fragging killing someone
the level of detail up close is astonishing
my hat goes off to paul steed the creator of the models in q   the gameplay is the best around
unlike unreal tournament i feel like im in control of the environment
games for q are designed for less people around  than in unreal tournament in which about  or so would work well
its pretty hard to explain the gameplay but the best way to put it would be to say quotit just feels rightquot the control weapon firing is much smoother
i also like the stability of q more than in unreal tournament
 the mod modification of the game
to add depth to the game that was not originally added community for quake is the best in the business
so many great mods are being released with many more to come
mods like alliance ctf  quakefortress  and jailbreak  just to name a few are cropping up to make the quake experience that much more enjoyable
the teams spend months adding to quake
they add models sounds textures and just about everything to essentially change the game
i am however looking forward to more great mods in the future
one note unreal tournament has great mods lined up but quake is the clear leader in the mod community
 the network code is top notch
players with k andegad
k modems will love the new code
obviously having a cable modem makes the experience much better but the game is very playable with dial up connectionsnow for the cons  gameplay types
with domination assault and last man standing ut is the clear winner in the variety category
in a nutshell q offers straight deathmatch with  ctf maps for kicks
i believe more attention should have been made to ctf
 the bots boy are they bad
i know a lot of time was spent by the quake team but it just didnt work
the bots in ut are much better
try playing capture the flag with these bots
youll be heading for the multiplayer arenas in no time
 there is no classic style single player in the game
there is a quotladderquot match but i completed that in about  hours
playing this may help beginners but there is nothing like playing online with other human players and ping times in the s
as they say youll need real life experiencein conclusion q is by far my favorite game
with great deathmatch and ctf it could have been better but hey its still fun and the mod community hard at work to essentially add to the game i give this game  stars
i do believe q is geared towards avid fans
if you are a beginner check out unreal tournament
that too is a great game
but for me i will always be a quake aficionado
to finish the line in the subject area  stars for me for others  star
endpersonally i love the game
for me it is a stress releaver
sit down play fast and shoot stuff
the graphics are intense the game play outstanding and the soundswow
this game is not for people who dont  like multiplayer obviously
oddly enough it is a stratagy game
i have  found so many times that the good players are the ones that outsmart the  other ones
duh you say
but many complain of the simplicity
quotoh  all you do is run around and shootquot
if you do that then you will  get a rocket down your throat
it is a great fast paced quick thinking  game
in my opinion it is much better than unreal
i think the graphics  are much better it runs better character design is infinatly better and  so are the levels and weapons
try them both
if you do i think you  will agreegraphicsgameplay
loading timesyea im grading that tooonline
overallquake iii is a classic not to be messed with
the graphics engine for that time was superb
the graphics could have done better thoughthe whole new scenario to the game is off the chart
its friken sweetthe online is great too
this is one of quakes finest for the pcgo out nd try to find this classiclateri just bought quake  arena and i was suprised in this game
quake  arena is really for multiplayer so if anyone likes fastpaced multiplayer action then i say buy this game
you should practice on single player cause multiplayer is pretty tough depending on who youre battling
quake  arena has some pretty cool weapons good graphics and smart bots
there arent many weapons but theyre really useful and damaging
the graphics are dazzling and the bots are smart
when your battling bots they arent programed to just chase after you and fragging you
they talk to each other and set up traps which i think is pretty unique
i bought this game a few days ago and its a pretty cool game
if you like fast multiplayer action then i say get quake  arenawow
ok i know its  and im playing a game from  but what the heck
lol
this game is wonderful reminiscent of the old days when picard and data were still on our screens every night bringing some new and amazing futuristic discovery to the screen while becoming legends
the interaction with the star trek crew alone is enough to warrant a purchase
as far as graphics now id give them about a  out of  back in  these would have easily rated a  as the fixed enviroment system allows for a very rich and detailed backdrop to the story
surprisingly mosto f the flaws of  this game are the same as the original resident evil series
the controls can be frustrating the cutscenes can be a bit blocky and the ai a little on the repetitive side
however if you love star trek and are looking for a great adventure game to keep you occupied and immersed in star trek play thisif you like classic sidescrolling platformers this game is definately worth getting
its simple enough to just grab the controller and start playing but challenging enough to make you have to figure out what youll need to do or get before you can go for 
nice game and fun
this is a game i reccomend especially if you have little ones that come over often to entertain them withif you liked the old type of sonic games on the megadrive then youll love this
this game is hard unless your talented at games like me
i gave this a five because of the grate impact on me as my first ps game with crash  this is a d platformerthe way you move left or rightand i prefer it to rayman  that is di do prefer d games to drayman is a classic game released in the playstations early years
and its still a great gamegameplay  sidescrolling joy
you are rayman an armless legless neckless thingy who has to save his world after the evil mr dark takes over it
you will need to free your caged friends in all of the huge worlds to get to mr darks layer
you also get powers such as punching helicopter and more
you also fight tough bosses like space mamachallange its hard
and only  continues
but heres a hint if you have less than  continues press up down left and right on the continue screen to get  extra continuesgraphics  they are colorful and i mean colorful
bright cartoonlike d graphics
the best of the pss d graphicssound  it sounds greatmusic  i love the music
my favorite tune is the music on certai levels on the cave of skopsso if you have a ps and are looking for a chalanging sidescroller look no furtheras some of my readers know i own a playstation  after  years of original playstation and that ive kept all of my games from it
id consider myself a fairly experienced gamer and one of the most challenging beautiful and all out extrodanariy games for the playstation has got to be the d original masterpiece raymanwhat do i mean by challenging
even after all of my best efforts and devoted hours to this title i still have yet to beaten it
rayman has over  massive levels  including bounus levels  with some of the most vibrant and imaginitive colored backrounds on each level which are layerd to look like they never end
and it works remarkably to make you believe that your in the shoes of that limbless lionhearted hero rayman out to save your worldrayman also offers deep gameplay and many moves such as using his surfer hair for flying like a helicopter and his fist for powering up grabbing nearby items and firing out at enimies
he uses climbing and crawling technequies to acheive unexplored parts of any level and can run and shrink to escape faster from threatsrayman adventures through many magical relams which include band land blue mountains picture city dream forest the caves of skops and finally candy chateau
these worlds have their own quirky enimies and backrounds according to their themes and have many passages a creatures to save hidden somewhere in themmany other sequals such as rayman  rayman rush and rayman arena are all in full d but are never as fun  dont get me wrong raymans sequals on playstation and playstation  are good  or as grand of a spark as the original
rayman sure has had many changes to appeal to his new generation of gamersdespite its childish looks rayman has something to offer to any age and breed of gamer and should belong on every playstation owners shelfrayman was and still remains one of the greatest titles in gaming history so if your intrested definetly pick up raymanthis game might be d about  years old this game premeared on sega saturn and the idea is kinda strange but this is a great game
at first  it starts out quite easy youll beat the first  levels in less than   minutes but soon youre wondering if there is a way to beat the game
heck before you know it youll buy the stratigy guide to try and figure  out what to do next
this game has given me more of a challange in gaming  than lara croft did in tomb raider
i highly recomend this game
now  where is a copy for dreamcast
huh segathe original rayman is perhaps one of the finest platformers that ever came out
theres a reason why this game has been rereleased for some times not as much as rayman  but still
that reason iseverythingthe game has one of the best soundtracks ive ever listened to in a video game
i can tell there were lots of effort put into this masterpiece
you can even put the game into a cd player and it would play the musicbefore there was ly lums razorbeard the rabbids or even globox for that matter there was rayman the fairy that created him and the evil mr dark
this was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games
it had great gameplay catchy music as noted and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environmentsas you start the game you only start out with the basics running and jumping
but that as you progress through you get newer powers such as being able to hang on platforms throw your fists at enemies man thats cool and gasplt being able to fly for a short period of time
sure later games have these powers as staples to raymans character but back when this was the only game out you have to work your way to get theseand you would have fun doing itthe problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the games difficulty
yeah it is challenging but some find it to actually be too challenging
nevertheless this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a playstation lying aroundi love this game this game is the best game in the worldrayman  uses the  ram expansion pak and have gorgeous graphics and colors d worlds to explore and find items solve puzzles fight bosses
great game everyonethe best game i play in a long time
the levels are cool and very pretty
the background color is great and smoothrayman is trying to save himself and hes friends form being takeing over
if he doest the world will be lost foreverin the game to save the world you must fine four mask in the hidden worlds and in the game raymans friends will help you to get your powers backyou are in raymans world now
help him save the world before it is to late
in the game you will fine lums in cages in the worlds help the lums escape
there are many lums
there are blue lums lums that give you air
and there are red lums that give you heath and life
in the game you get to go in the pretty places and the darkness places in the gamesave the world form evil and darkness before the goodness is gone foreverhave fun in the game i did and i love it you will love it tooi hopethis game is great
it plays well it looks good besides compared to dk banjotooie and it does not slow down at all
now this is a platform game and you do not just try to jump up to some wall that is too high
you will have to solve puzzles
so nobody should complain because good games will challenge you
i only complain when the games are too easy and does not require brains such as super man although alot of people hated this game because of the random dungens and  stuff like that and never really had the patience to sit down and play the  game and imidietly decided the story went no where
i pity those people
after over  months of playing this game i was happy out of what i received  from it
not only did it give me quite a challenge but it also gave me  hours of fun
although it did annoye me with how much i had to battle to  boost my experience points when i finally got to my destination i was  pleased i worked with it
now it doesnt compeat with quotfinale  fantasyquot or other rpgs like that but i did find myself playing one  of the best rpgs still
i truly hope everyone who dismissed this game as  too boring will give it another chance to see the beauty of this game
plus with some of the best graphics ive seen makes this another one to get  just for that
i cant wait to play quotevolution  far off  promisequot and hopefully well get a quotevolution quotim a big jrpg fan and this is probably my favorite exclusive to dreamcast except the one on gamecube
great story
wonder graphics for the time
i got this purely to have since i lost it years before
if you have a dreamcast and love jrpg play thisthe gamecube port of this game and the nd one far away promise was the first game i had ever played on the gamecube
i absolutely loved it
so now  years later i find myself with a dreamcast which i never had as a kid and a used copy of evolution from the local just press play store
i was really excited about it
when i started playing it i was pleasantly surprised to find that the dreamcast version was  times better
you are able to interact with literally everything in the game
in this game you play the role of mag launcher who is following in the footsteps of his father and trying to become the greatest adventurer
to do so you must navigate through multiple dungeons with your best friend linear and any of  other playable characters to find rare artifacts and weapons to not only grow stronger but to pay off the debt your father left behind
the dungeons are beautiful and creative and this game has a new game  feature so it makes replaying it loads of fun
definitely a musthave for the dreamcastthere are many versions of rayman  out there ranging from the n to the playstation  each version has small variations in graphics sound quality and controls but they are all in essence the same game and what a game it israyman  the great escape is the sequel to the playstation exclusive rayman
in this adventure rayman has been captured by an army of robotic pirates who are conquering the world
after a narrow escape rayman is charged with finding an all powerful being named polkus who can stop the pirates conquest
now it is once again up to rayman to rescue the captured people and save the worldthe biggest change is the transition from d to d gameplay
the game is a third person platformer with simple and tight controls
rayman can use his hair as a chopper propeller to glide down rather than fall which can be a life saving move
the combat is very well implemented
by pressing the left trigger the camera centers behind rayman and if an enemy is present you will lock on to them
rayman attacks by shooting energy from his hand which is upgraded over the course of the game
part of the game if collecting the  yellow lums scattered across each level
finding these lums allows you to access the later levels and unlocks entries in an in game log that expands on the games backstory
some of the lums are found in cages which are also littered throughout the game  in total
for every ten cages your health bar is extended
finding all the lums and cages in any given level grants a bonus game where you can win attack upgrades though they are only temporary
the game has great flow that makes each level very fun to play throughas stated before rayman  was ported to may consoles
although it was originally released on the n a good version in its own right it was later rereleased to the pc which started the long line of ports and remakes
the dreamcast version is the closest to the pc version in terms of graphics and sound quality
it also upped the framerate to a smooth  fps
although the playstation version is largely the same and contains a hidden tech demo of the original rayman  beta the ps version suffers long load times and a severe drop in graphical quality
the playstation  had the game rayman  revolution which is an extreme overhaul of the original game
i personally believe that version is different enough from the rest to be owned in addition to the original game which of the many versions the dreamcast version offers the highest qualityperfect just what i was looking for and exactly what i needed
it works perfectly and came in great shape no damage and super fast shippinglove this product
so i dont waste money on batterysever noticed that your game boy color just runs right through your batteries
well if you get this charger your gbc will never be out of power and its so cheap
i reccomend you get this right nowthe mad catz gameboy ac adapter is the best item i have ever purchased
the cord is durable and the awesome purpleclear color is like eye candy to warm the soul
almost every time you plug it in it works without error
now i dont own a gameboy however this little powerhouse is a best buy even if you dont own one
buy this item todaythe adapter does just what youd expect plug your gbc into the wall and play without using up the battery power of your aasit works and i can still play my game and not have to put in new batteries i can play
now i need to get my a light for it and then i can play before i go to sleepthe color is the same of my gb advance has so is a nice match and works well thats the important arrive on time and the price is comfortable im happy with this onehey if youve got the st rct game be sure to be on the lookout for the nd one
with new scenarios which are much much harder then in the first  one that put you in totally different situations everything from a  bridge to a jungle to a cliff
you are sure to get hours more gameplay  from your orginal rct gamenew features include banner signs to divide  your park into themes
new themeing like jungle jurassic horror and  abstract
also a few new colors
new landscapes try making a hut around  your rollercoaster with roofing tiles or mars land and a variety of new  walls

there are so many new rides and features it makes the game a lot more fun to play because you have such a variety
the new rides are wickedthis expansion pack is definitely a great item to add to your rollercoaster tycoon game
just remember that this expansion has nothing truly major in it like graphic or sound enhancements
this is simply more  scenarios rides and a few other tweaks
i recommend buying this but do  not be dissapointed if you were expecting a full blown game expansionthis game is just as much fun as rollercoster tycoon with extra stuff in itif you dont buy this game with its other you are missing out on some of the most fun you can havejust think you can be the ride maker and be the  cause of people looseing their lunch from riding your rideif i had a top  ten list this one would be on itwhat can i really say other than fun fun fun
roller coaster tycoon corkscrew follies and loopy landscapes are just what the doctor ordered when it comes to rct
i absolutely can not think of any downfalls to either of the expansion packs
i have spent many a nights playing these games and still i have not gotten tired of them
corkscrew follies offers a wide variety of new coaster types as well as new carnival rides
there are also many new shops to choose from such as my personal favorite the seafood stand that looks like an octopus
this review will be short and sweet but i simply want it to be direct to the point and that is if you own the original roller coaster tycoon then corkscrew follies is a must have
definately worthy of  starsokay i know that title isnt very fitting for a janes game
however previous to this the most detailed flight sim i had ever played was freespace  and yes i know thats not even a flight sim
im just making an example
however as a novice to the genre i bought fa and was immediately intimidated by the extent of detail in the game
moreover as thin as the tutorial actually is it at least provides you with some sort of a basis to work with
if you search the web long enough you will find that there are a plethora of customized training missions that will teach you every important nuance of flying the fa so that you will at least be a functional pilotsecond other than the controls and learning time needed fa is a wonderful looking game
i have a mere celeron  with a ati rage card and the game still played at a fine speed with minimal slowdown once i toned down the level of detail
for that matter the game still looked wonderful the explosions were great fire and sunlight reflecting inside of my cockpitif you want to get into flying real flight sims like me take a shot at fa and be prepared to spend some time learning
itll take a while but figuring out how to play these kind of games is a more than worthwhile reward
fa is a great example of flight sims at the top of their game
buy it learn it revel in its quality reap the rewards of knowledgeso you want to fly a navy jet but you dont have the time no problem just buy this gamein this game you fly the fa  ef superhornet which is s navy jet take off the carrier shoot a few bandits turn back call the ball and land
sound exiting well if it is from janes its got to  besure its not as good as usaf but that was a once in a lifetime gamethis game is going to be on my hard drive for a long long time
the only thing it lacks is a random map generator which i think will be added in a patch or an addon later
if youre a turnbased strategy fan this game  is a must have
it blows heroes of might and magic an already superb  series out of the water with more detail better combat and just plain  better everything even better music which was very hard to beat
if  you dont love this game youre not a gamer
either that or youre just  a twitch gamer which is allmost as bad
in all my years of pc  gaming this is my favorite turnbased game tops master of magic and even  xcom
those two games held the quotlongest on hard drivequot awards up  until this one came along and i know it will unseat them
it might  actually be my favorite game of all time barnone but that remains to be  seen in the test of timebuy thisi loved this game and wanted to play it again
found it for a great price and it works on windows  with a little compatibility tweakingthis game carries on the tradition of master of magic and master of orion ii perfectly
if you like turn based strategy then you will love this game
even after all this time it still holds up and still has a place on my hard drivethe great thing about the game it lets you play in two modes
you can choose to have the battles decided in quick combat which is similar to civilization games where you are just in charge of choosing what units to build and sending them off to battle
you can also choose the strategic combat mode where every battle is fought on the strategic map and you take control of every unitif you are a fan of turn based strategy and dont mind a game with older graphics then i would highly recommend this gamei bought age of wonders when it first came out
the game in my opinion is the best computer fantasy war game that has ever been made
with the option of twelve different races and seven different spheres of magic there is definitely plenty of diversity and replay value in this game
the spell effects are charming and the musical score is beautiful
the single player campaign has a great story line and the multiplayer aspect of the single scenarios is well developed
heroes are very customizable and if you so choose you can actually have a hero represent you on the playing field as well though if you die you lose
there is only one thing that i would change about the game and that is some of the unit icons to be honest the artwork on some of the icons is a little lacking like they were rushing to get this product out the gates
all in all age of wonders is an awesome game and i am definitely looking forward to age of wonders dvd broke so i had to re get this one funhave all the gta could not be without this onethis game is definately the best one on my shelf
it never gets old
its one of those games where you dont care if you beat it it is still fun just roaming around irritating the cops stealing cars and running over elvis impersonators very cool
definately worth the money and definately the best game ive seenmy sister bought grand theft auto  gta a long time ago and i still play it
gta is a game where you can do almost anything
you can jack cars from anyone including the police
the main point of this game is that you have to work for  ruthless gangs without getting your hide thrown in jail
the jobs start off easily but then increase each time you work for a gang
the harder the job is the more money you get
but in order to work for a gang you have to show some respect
there are seven different gangs in the city and each of them hate each other
when you work for one gang then another gang looses respect for you then you gotta kill gang members from the gang that likes you then the gang that hates you will respect you so you can get another job from the gang that likes you
well its kinda tricky at first but once you get the hang of getting respect from another gang its pretty fun
there are over s of jobs and over s of cars
you can choose from armored lemos to tanks or even ice cream trucks
also this game is free
you can do anything to achieve your goals
you can put a bomb in a car and drive it to a gangs safehouse and blow them sky high
almost anything you can do
thats why i love this game
if you love being the bad guy sometimes and love a game where you can do anything from getting chased by cops to working for dangerous gangs then get this gamegta is set in a futuristic city where you try to earn quotrespectquot from gangsearning respect means killing their opposing gangthe more you killthe harder a job you get that pays alot more than an easy jobalso doing jobs and completing them earns you respect toothis game says kill  kill kill kill kill all over the box well not reallyi think ive  said enoughthis game tops off any gangster game
the camera angles are perfect
although it is actually slower then it was then the first one
the game play is much better and much more cleaner
this is a must game for anyone who has a taste for blood and likes seeing people getting killed in games
if your the total opposite then i suggest you dont buy this game
this game is  addictivethis is the most fun and addictive game i have played in ages
but first the badthe most common complaint about this game is over its controls
i assume that this is somewhat exaggerated however
my system falls well below the minimum requirements listed on the box but it still played well enough
the only frustration i experienced was that the stranger would sometimes turn too quickly or too slowly and that would render the more precisionbased puzzles very difficult
however i still made it through and enjoyed the effort despite my weak computer system
some also complain that the camera angles at times interfere with gameplay but i found that they helped create mood and suspense and at times when it mad fighting difficult i would just move to a point where i got better visibility this is less of a problem with autoaim but it does sometimes get annoyingthe storylines are quite enthralling and you will find yourself running off to the computer at every moment to find out what happens next or to further explore the amazing scenery
the fully rendered graphics and sounds are amazing and the gameplay is both full of action and brainteaserseach act focuses to a different extent on action vs adventure gaming and can be played in any order i recommend doing them in order unless you get stuck and cant get help immediately
act  and act  are an excellent balance act  is mainly action and act  is mainly puzzle solving
each act is also wildly different in its villians and settings so you never grow bored and the characters are very well realized and leave you wanting to experience more adventures with them there are rumours that this will be made into a tv series
the basic storyline is that it is the s and you are a mysterious figure with a top secret government agency that hunts monsters
in act  you team up with svetlana a sexy halfhumanhalfvampire on a mission through european castles and forests involving vampires and werewolves
in act  you are on your way to a small western town to clear it of its problems with the walking dead but the werewolves from act  first try to exact their revenge
eventually you wind up solving a lovecraftian mystery deep underground with the aid of a voodoo god
in act  a chicago gang is bringing its dead members back as frankenstein monsters and you have to destroy their monster factory but they are in control of the city
in act  you must confront a former member of the organization who wants to destroy it for its new politically correct willingness to work with good supernatural creatures and escape all the deadly devious traps in his house of horrors
there is a bonus act basically a short film but you can only view it with the editor which you can download from the nocturne websitethere are many instances of dark humour you can attack zombies with their own body partsand pleasant surprises i dont want to spoil as well including funny but gross little scenes and interesting variations on the creatures specifically in the zombie town
the opening title film is also great although it unfortunately often just plays the music while you stare at a black screen  just start the game enough times and youll see it
playing this game is better than watching the xfiles and it is much more gory and quotadultquotthis is quite simply the best action titles i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing
in fact it ranks as one of my top three favorite games
so what makes this game so great
every aspect of this game lives up to its original premise and title
you are a thief
this is definitely not  your average firstperson blastfest
in fact the best course of action  is to avoid combat at all costs
stealth concealment quietness and  thinking are what counts here
the enemy artificial intelligence is some  of the best i have seen
enemies will here you if you make too much noise  see you if too much light shines on your hiding place call for help and  generally behave like living and breathing people
plus the later enemies  are some of the scariest ive seen
the story is superb the weapon  selection perfect love the blackjack and the atmosphere extremely well  fleshed out
the cutscenes are some of the best in gaming and the  voiceacting is topnotch
to summarize this is one of the best action  titles to ever come down the pipe
no gamer should miss itthis is the kind of game that sets a new standard for innovation in gameplay
thief has a great plot and very original gameplay
you have to think like a thief in this game to have any chance of surviving
your  supply of weapons is definitely not for head on confrontations
there is  something very satisfying about sneaking up on someone and simply knocking  them over the head with your blackjack
who would think that not  splattering someone all over a walllike every other fps out therewould be  so fun
but it is
the only real flaws of this game is the ai and some of  the enemies that you have to face
first the ai is fine most of the time  but can be very quirky at times such as not noticing you when you are  making enough noise to annoy a jackhammer operator or noticing you when you  are silent and still in complete darkness
the other flaw is that in a few  levels you have to deal with creatures that can see you in the dark and  also cant be knocked out
this is annoying because the greatness of this  game comes from sneaking around
this seems to be a common complaint and  has been addressed in the sequel
despite these flaws this is one of the  best overall games for the pc on the market todaythief gold is the gold edition of thief dark project it has three new mission plus the orginal  levels
thief gold has three new levels but they are not in the end of the game they are very well inserted into the storyline
in the orginal game you are requierd to steal four tailsmens water and fire tailsmens were in mission quotthe lost cityquot air and earth tailsmens in mission quotundercoverquotbut in thief gold they all have their own missions the earth tailsmen is in the mission quotmages keepquot the water tailsmen is in the mission quotsongs of cravensquot
besides this there is another new mission quotthieves guildquot
the level desinging for all the three missions are superb and they are very large and it will take you long to complete
besides this there are many charecters and sound too
you will love the singing charecter in quotsongs of cravensquot
the orginal missions are also reworked to give great replay quotlost cityquot and quotbonehoardquot for example looks different and there are new villans in them
thief gold looks a lot better that the orginalthe aigraphicssound are very good
there is also a fourth mission a secret fun mission in the end which shows the bugs that went into prodction like how the water effect turned out when they initially and the orginal design for certain creatures even that mission is fun to play
thief gold is a must buy for fps fans even for persons who have the thief dark project as the three new missions are fantasticthis game is excellent capital e  excellent
make no mistakes though this is a first person shooter where you must not shoot anyone because everyone is stronger than you and you get chewed up in a face to face  battle the emphasis is on stealth and invisibility and its the first time  that i have seen anything like this
its nice to know that theres still  room for originality in the gaming world
in this game you are a thief and  of course you have to steal stuff
thats it
thats all you have to do
its how you have to do it that is gut wrenching you have to sneak  undetected in shadows and move slowly
its great that theres a  stealthometer on the bottom of the screen its a gauge that tells you  how visible and noisy you are at the time
helps a lot
i have to give  credit to the designers and developers they thought this through a lot and  came out with an incredible game play
i just bought this game and i am  amazed at how good it looks in spite of the fact that it is an old game
the models soldiers and monsters move in a very realistic way
on top of  that i am very surprised at the dialogs and voices
i kinda feel guilty to  do it but i really enjoy myself just sitting in a dark corner and listening  to a guard only a few steps away complaining that he is starving or that  his bosses are incompetent or just mumbling senslessly to himself
it also  has a good story line and some levels are really creepy and very well  designed
this game is a musthave if you like a change of pace from the  various quakes and  unrealsive been an avid pc game player since  and own hundreds of titles and i can honestly say that thief and thief  are the pinnacle of pc gaming
this is without doubt the most immersive and scary gameplaying ive ever done
yet everything is presented tastefully understated
nothing is in your face
i frequently actually had to stop playing because i was getting too involved and nervousbut i always went back
i did several marathon sessions on these games some lasting over  hours at a time nonstop
they have massive replay value as each time you play you will have different adventures
i particularly remember all the times i ended up blowing my cover and not having recently saved my game i didnt want to start from my last save so i ended up running for my life from guards who gathered up more guards as they chased me
one time i had a good ten minute chase just because i didnt want to give up the progress i had made
i was chased down hallways of a mansion finally finding an open window i climbed out onto the porch roof lost several health points as i jumped to the ground
i lost those guys but then the guards in the front yard saw me and took over
i took several blows and arrows as i did an end run around them and headed out the front gate
they were hot on my trail
i ran down several city streets totally disoriented finally gaining some distance by hiding around a corner in a doorway
i took out  of them as they passed by with my arrows
then i ran again
the others saw me and chased me but they were a hundred yards behind me now
i came to an arching bridge which i began to cross
suddenly i realized where i was and knew i was trapped
i jumped over the railing and into the water of a canal
i went underwater and heard arrows splashing into the water above me
i swam underwater upstream until i was almost dead from lack of air then i surfaced
they were all on the bridge looking the other way in the direction i had jumped
i made my way quietly to some steps and climbed out of the canal
i was down to  health points
i went back to the mansion and found the lower level almost deserted because they were all down at the canal
i went in and continued my mission this time remembering to save my game
its this kind of thing which happens a lot
which will induce sweat and cause you to feel exhausted after youve played
this is more of an experience than a game
dont miss thiseveryone knows that when this game fist came out it was a classic
the only first person sneak em up out there
its immensly original rewarding with nice touches and cut scenes great storyline and is hugely addictive
the levels are big and the characters lifelike
altough this game has now  been surpassed by thief the metal age i would still buy this game again
especially as it has now gone budget
it even has more levels this time  and is worthly in any gamers collection
go buy it noweach genre has its problems
flight simulators have a difficult time telling stories
pure adventure games often have quotartificialquot interfaces that come across feeling far too fake
strategy games take too  long to play
and first person shooters have an inevitable  quotsamenessquot to themquotthiefquot happily avoids the  pitfalls of each genre while borrowing the best qualities from them all
like the best adventure games the atmosphere created is so total you cant  help but be lost in it
yet its not just posh backgrounds and surround  sound moodiness its a game of strategy
the goal here is to steal not  to kill and that makes your choices entirely more calculated than is  common in action games
if you kill someone you have to worry about how  much noise hell make in death
youll have to hide the body
and youll  have to douse the lights so that he wont be able to see and fight back  more effectively
its frequently easierand smarterto just walk away  than to killin short this is a game players game
once youve been  wowed by all the things your computer can do once youve seen all the  pretty new games  once youve shot down your first million starships  this is the game you settle into for the long haulbe warned though  quotthiefquot is so wholly satisfying it will rob you of the ability  to enjoy  percent of the games on the marketi loved half life and have played it again and again
i suppose that you only realise how far ahead of its time the game was
its  years old and i recently just played it yet again and it was just as fun as the first time
when opposing force was released however the half life experience just got even betterin this expansion pack you play corporal adrian shephard one of the special ops soldiers sent to clean up black mesa and eliminate gordon freeman
on your way in however you are brought down before insertion
you find yourself in the depths of the beseiged facility with little idea of whats going on
of course you soon learn the terrible truth of your situation and are flung into a hellish world filled with aliens and monsters hungry for your blood
but soon enough black ops arrive to take over and you become a target for elimination by both humans and aliens alike
the only way to escape and survive is to fight and its one hell of a fightthe reason i say this expansion pack is one of the best i have every played is because its long and like halflife very replayable
you also get to command soldiers who you traditionally wouldve fought and you wield many different and new weapons both human and alien
the desert eagle sniper rifle and saw are some new real world weapons that really pack a punch while the displacer selfteleporter slimeball gun and shock rifle are the new experimental and alien weapons
each weapon is interesting and fun to use especially the shock rifle
of course with new weapons and allies come new enemies
youll encounter shock troopers black ops snipers and new forms of zombies to name but a few
and of course there are new environments to explore and new bosses too one being the hideous pitworm that makes those three dragon things that gordon fought look like amoebas
an expansion pack is meant to excite entertain and enthrall but most importantly it should expand on the previous game which is exactly what this game does
 for attaining the very goal that all expansion packs should strive forif you manage to get blue shift youll also be able to play this game with the high definition pack which gives everything a better look and gives the game a greater appeal
the gameplay is as fluid as ever and the action is realistic fast and furious
 for gameplay even today
the graphics are great with the hd pack so the game gets  for the original content and  for the new hd packthe sound and backing tracks are wonderful and really add to the atmosphere and ambience of the game
even today half life and all of its addons have great clear sound so it gets yet another solid the game is just fantastic
its fun gripping interesting scary actionpacked gory and graphically pretty impressive
it gets  overall or  according to my new percentage system
its nearly totally flawless
youll enjoy this game if youre an fps fan or a half life fan
in terms of difficulty it gets  for the hard setting  for normal and  for easy so play it on hard for the maximum challenge
its a great buy even today and its pretty darn cheap so why not buy it then eh
please note you must have the full retail version of half life installed on your computer for this game to worki enjoyed quotopposing forcequot even more than the original halflife
i thought it was better being an army grunt and also having a much wider selection of guns and explosives
the best level would have to  have been quotthe packagequot where you get to command a group of your  fellow soldiers through a literal army of black ops peopleas always  could have been just as good without all of the gore
also this game had  plenty of coursing in it
im not sure why they didnt include this in  their rating since its obviously there
just a warning to let you know  that the rating of  and up is properly given
another thing i was  disappointed with was the plot
you never find out what happens to yourself  or freemen you never find out who the gman is who tracks you in both  halflife and op force and you never find out why the government sent you  and your buddies in and then decided to kill you with more army grunts
maybe im missing something here
i hope all my questions will be answered  in halflife all in all its a game right along there with  halflife that is sure to became a classic very soon
so what are you  waiting for
buy itthis game is truly the greatest addon for halflife other than cs
i wasnt too thrilled with being able to play quotbobquotblueshift but i couldnt wait to play this
the army always bugged the s out of me and i wanted to be them
but it wasnt exactly what i expected
they could have made this  times better if they knew that the problem was going on not being thrusted into the action like everyone else
i wanted to be able to neutralize the threat and the facilitators
not have them be our crutch
and you dont get good ammoweapons in the beginning
its annoying
but i enjoyed thisyou thought half life was a good game well you have another one right here to hit you in the face
this is another great game
it is just as great as half life
i like the thought that you get to be put on the other sideone of a handful of decent expansion packs this takes the original plot of halflife and looks at it from the perspective of one of the grunts sent to pacify the disaster site at black mesa
that said your original  mission becomes quickly subverted due to unforseen intervention and you  find yourself rushing through a halflife parallel universe sometime  intersecting with the original game
its essentially more of the same but  shorter a terrible shame although you get an expanded arsenal and some  useful allies
theres more of an emphasis on multicharacter soldier vs  soldier battles than before and at times this could easily have been  kellys heroes  the game such was the war film atmosphere
whilst  halflife finished with a dissapointing trek through an alien world of  sticks closely to reality although you can beam yourself into zen if you  so desire
the tragic tragic shame of it all is that youll probably  finish it in a couple of days as it isnt very big
roll on halflife this is actually a very good expansion for halflife
usually expansions stink but this one is quite acceptable
opposing force takes you back to black mesa a one of the us marines trying to capture gordon freeman play the first half life before purchasing this
there is an extroidanary arsenal of weapons in opp
force and challenging new aliens that do more damage
if you liked halflife then buy this expansion pack cause its really good
i do have one complaint i cannot play this sucker online
i have a mhz pentium  its old but still reads the data and i have cable modemhigh speed connection and it says some file differs from a server file
oh well you can play single player over and over because its so fun and addicting
have fun playingpatrickmajor shephard
experience halflifes lambda complex incident all over again through the eyes of major shephard part of a squad sent in to contain the chaos that has erupted in the lambda research complexfirst play halflife
actually this game wont even run without it so you dont have much of a choiceyep halflife was a great game
but with this expansion it gives you a whole other game
you play as a different person while using a different arsenal of weapons and much more
with a nonconfusing way of play it makes you think without getting frustrated
if you liked halflife you gotta get this one
for a good deal get blue shiftthis is probably one of half lifes best expansions because you get quite a bit of new weapons to play with including a sniper rifle which does a lot of damage by the way
also there is some new enemies such as the military head crab zombie and even a more buffed up version of the head crab zombie thing
also this is a pretty long expansion pack to play and i enjoyed it but i dont know if you will enjoy it
if you dont like the fps  genre at all dont even bother with this game or if you dont like half life series i wont recommend it to you at all unless of course you are a very open minded gamer that is willing to try something newokay after reading most of the reviews below im going to break my review down into a list of pro points and con pointsprosexcellent new aliens
from the oneeyed chickenlegged shocktroopers to the bullish lurching sewer creatures all new alien strains add plenty of much needed variety
theres plenty of them too offhand id say that theres at least eight or so new enemiesexcellent new weapons
the sniper rifle adds a different slant on the large scale battles and the new alien weapons are great fun except maybe the barnacle grappling hook
the storyline is quite snappy too with plenty of glimpses of the mysterious suited man and a few secret conversations that you can eavesdrop onusual high standard in terms of the graphics and sound
the alien noisesvoices still make me jumpy when you can hear em but theyre hiding somewhere those shocktroopers sound just like daleks too
conssome people say that its too short but for an add on pack it more than suffices
clearing it in one sitting was mentioned below too im good at it and played it on and off for a few weeks
however the end monster and actual ending are both letdowns
the final battle consists of a series of climbing ropes using mounted laser guns and using your grappling hook over and over and over again
more like the krypton factor assault course than an pandimensional showdowniffy bugs
i have a pentium  voodoo dfx card and  of ram but the game stuttered and froze plenty of times during musicsound sequences
sometimes especially in lifts you get stuck on the floor and have to reset the game to get outim not too sure about the ai either
any friendly troops that you lead into battle either refuse to follow you charge straight into gunfire or shoot you in the back
their average life expectancy in battle is about a minute or so
the bad guys arent really the sharpest tools in the shed either following basic patterns or causing you grief by being very fast instead of very smarti didnt come across any of the epic battles id read about and was looking forward to
the largest team of men that i led into the fray was three
moments into it all three ran into an upturned container to be gunned down one after the next by a gleeful shocktrooperlike half life itself the majority of the time youre frightened of noises and the dark rather than tonnes of aliens charging at you
the latter more regularly would be welcome and draw the games out a bit
the best part is the sewer section where one minute youve got a horde of giant halfbull halfspider thingies thundering after you and just when you think youve time for a breather an infinite amount of scythearmed flea aliens start spilling from doorsok
so to summerize opposing forces is a very worthy purchase that adds plenty of great features to an already great game
not very long or particularly hard but well worth moneyone of the most popular playstation game characters has arrived again with another great tomb raider game
this is one of my favourite games and is definitely one of the hardest games on playstation
this is the last and hardest tomb raider game on playstation
it has excellent d graphics and realistic backgroundsthere are many fun levels in this game including the train level car level and many other levels
me and my friends love this game
if you like games like all tomb raider games duke nukem die hard and tomorrow never dies youll love this gameyou have to buy it and trust me youll love ittomb raider the last revelation is by far the most complicated game in the series
but for people like me who enjoy challenges thats a good thing
its a very exciting game with spellbinding graphics an interesting and captivating plot and a lot of suspense
even though i havent finished it yet i love the game and look forward to the day i do finish it
i recommend it to all people who love actionadventure like i doim big fan of lara croft
i started my adventure with tomb raider from tlr and went back to tr
when i saw this game on amazon i had to buy it
this is the best tr ever made imho better than underworld
the graphic looks ancients  but the playability and climate is unbeatable
of course the price is great too i paid   and it came in original boxthis was my first tomb raider game and after playing all the rest this one is still my favorite
im waiting for the new one to come out
the story line is great the places your visit are breath taking and its full of adventure with great graphics
this tomb raider definetely gets five starsthis game to me was the best in the series although many will dissagree with that
story line consists of her going to egypt in search of an artifact that will save the world if she can get it before the posessed prof von croy gets ahold of ita few really great things about this game include some of the best grapics ive seen in the tomb raider series and quite possibly the best of its release time
not to mention the great motors you can drive
the best part about it was the story line which at times has you gripping to your seatthe only negative thing i can think of is the few bugs this game has which im sure later versions took care of
ive only bumped into the bug once or twice and it was an accident ie drawing a certain weapon in a certain frame etci most certainly give this  stars for its story and its replay valuei loved the other tomb raiders and this one is great
well except for a few things its not compatable with any laptop which makes no sense what so ever x theres like  levels  and i hate that it leaves you hanging at the endnow the good things are its really fun the graphics are great and youll be trying to figure out one level for like days oo which isnt that bad because i love challengesp and it also helps if you have the walkthroughif you liked the others you must get this onepharoah is a game in witch you can build cities and create a mighty empire
this game is not like a age of empire and in a way it takes more skill to play
you will become addicted to this game and i would highly  recommend it to everybodycheck the date on my review   years old and this game is still fun to play
thats saying something
pharaoh is basically simcity set in ancient eygpt or if youre really picky its casear with new graphics
not only does it take the great classic citybuilding game and place it in a compelling setting but it also adds some much needed depth to this type of game like huge monuments and pyramids for you to buildgames of this type all do the same thing  you layout streets and houses little people move in and you gradually add services and extras to make them happier more wealthy
you make sure every neighborhood has a policeman and a firewatch a market someplace to worship and some entertainment
pharoah improves over simcity by actually showing you your citizens as they walk from place to place
the streets are packed with people as they go about their business
you must also create jobs and establish industries thus creating goods for you to sell or your citizens to use
it is a basic game that is fun for anyone of any agepharoah adds some extra features which allow it to rise above the others  monuments and nile farming
the nile works on an annual cycle of flooding its banks so any aggriculture must be very well planned because your farmers must grow food for the entire year
monuments are just what you expect from ancient eygpt  pyramids the sphinx obelisx and various temple complexs
they are huge and you can watch as your workers build them brick by brick dragging the stones from quarries up the wooded ramps to atop the pyramids
wonderfulthis is a great game even for the beginner
graphics are good
after the tutorial there are many campaigns to choose from or you can follow the scenario
highly recommendedi have to say this is my favorite game
the graphics are terrific the music isnt annoying the cutscene animations are marvelous and i havent stayed up till  in the morning to play a game since i can remember
the  accomplishment you feel when you complete a pyramid is quite remarkable
the game is so much fun and has so many great features you could play the  game for weeks straight and still not get boredan impulse buy at the computer store that turns into a great game
when i bought my computer in october i had no quotrealquot games
so i was in search of being entertainedi have always been fascinated by the ancient world especially egypt
when i came across this game i had to buy
i didnt realize that i would spend a lot of time being engrossed in this game
and for the value its excellentjust remember to keep the gods happyare you boring with sim city 
do try pharaoh
this is a game seems as sim city but its base on ancient egypt
you need to build a great city and when you reach the target you can start another one
there are many different maps for you to choose there
the game will also teach you how to play if you is a new player
you wont feel boring after you play this game i dont think they had mcdonalds in egypt but this game still rules
yeahi purchased pharaoh four months ago and i am still playing at quotnormalquot difficulty level having reached the rank of pharaoh perhaps i am close to finishing
historically accurate visually precise and colorful welldesigned no glitches or crashes and great longterm fun
if youre into firstperson shooter games or frenetic speed skip pharaoh
however if you are looking for a game with which you can kick back relax and have fun before turning in at night pharaohs your game
iow its a quotwinddownquot game not an adrenaline rusherive played aoe aok caesar  and while aok is the best game ive ever played this is probably nd
well worth the investmentthis is an excellent city building game with a great egyptian theme
good progression in difficulty so that you dont get frustrated with the game
you start out managing a small village to create mega cities with their own wonders
the game produces walkers that give you feed back on your city such as such and such god might be unhappy or hey my market is overflowing with luxery items
you can click on the houses to see what is holding their development up
you can do overlays showing property value distribution of goods and other such information
you create a trading empire managing where your goods go and what goods you are importing in for your citizensand ive been doing it ever since
my dad bought me this in the spring of  to cut to the chase this game is about building cities in ancient egypt
in my opinion the fun in playing games is about doing things that you cant do in real life and citybuilding in ancient egypt is a good example of one of those things
you will start by building some humble cottages and maybe even a well for your people
you will have to provide food water entertainment health care etc and as you do so your city will evolve
if you need more money you can build a tax collectors office
you decide how much tax the people are going to pay
low tax will make you poor but popular at least for a while and high tax will make you richer but less popular
but then again money is needed to make the city better
as your city gets bigger and better you might even consider building the ultimate construction in the game the pyramid
if youre not interested in history now i almost guarantee you will be after playing this game
i cant think of a game that has given me more hours of fun than this
oh wait the other games in sierras city building series actually have caesar caesar ii caesar iii caesar iv master of olympus  zeus emperor rise of the middle kingdom are all made with this same great citybuildingrecipe as pharaoh
all highly recommended including expansions
the other games i listed are set in rome roman empire greece and china respectivelyi think derek g missed the pointyour farm workers stand in the flood and drowned because you havent built a place for them to take the food
simple really
thats what i love about this gameeverything has a point  and a purpose
ive been playing for about two weeks straight now   hours a day i was very frustrated for the first  days or so and now  ive finally figured it out
everything effects everything if you want  to play a complete city building game this is the one
great graphics  great cause and effect and even the music doesnt get too annoying
you  will lose sleep over this gamebough this game around  i still have it and i still play it
this is one of the best and greatest city building games of all timepharoah was a christmas gift to me in   i wore out a copy the first year i had it and even now over two years later its still my favorite of the strategycity building games
theres so much to it that it can take a year or more to get used to it allthe depth of the game is what i think i like the best
i played caesar  for a while but there was a lack of depth to it all farms would yield the same amount of food there was no massive project to keep you busy the gods were all the same and you didnt have a lot of choice over whether you had a peaceful or warring scenario
pharoah changes that
your farms will yield various amounts of food or goods based on the floodplain the meadow irrigation or other things affecting them
sometimes you run out of room in a storage yard or granary and the workers in the field will stand there and be drowned
sure its a little extreme i dont expect the average citizen to allow themselves to be drowned but it does give the you snooze you lose feeling
if you cant store it you lose itthe gods are much improved over caesar  each god has a personality and they have a pecking order now
theres a patron god for each scenario and  local gods
the patron deity needs more attention than the lesser gods and all gods can help or harm your city
you can get double crops full storage yards festivals thrown for other gods and other things if they are happy and plagues destroyed farms and lowered kingdom ratings if you piss them offthe monuments are another thing i like
you cant just meet the basic requirements sometimes you have to build a monument as well which takes time supplies and a lot of labor
it takes time to put a monument together which is nice and annoying if you need the time to finish up your city its not a big deal but if youve met all the other requirements in the scenario the monument building can take a whileall in all pharoah is a great game
my only complaint is when i start a new family and i have to go through the first few levels which are like an ingame tutorial
if youve played caesar  before or played pharaoh before it can get oldthis is a freakin fun game ive been playing it for a couple years now and im still not bored
the expansion set is better but this is a once in a life time game
go ers
ratchet deadlock is another game i recommendwhen i picked this game up in the summer of  i wasnt really into rpgs
im still not into the pure ones but this game gave me some respect for them
diablo ii is fun easy to learn challenging and has great multiplayer
many have criticized its graphics
i wasnt really bothered by the simple graphics
i especially appreciate the fact that with better graphics the game would be too large to install on most typical hard drives
the only big flaws area battlenet community full of people would decapitate their mothers if it meant getting a good item
although this isnt blizzards fault youll still have to deal with it when you play onlinerepetitive play
within any one character type barbarian amazon sorceress necromancer or paladin once youve gotten all the skills everything is pretty much the same
it gets boring after a while and you either start a new character or stop playing altogetherforgetable storyline
theres no reason to wonder what will happen next
it will just mean fighting another monstersoverall id recommend this as perfect for person with nothing else to do during the summer
its addictive enough to demand frequent play but during the school year you might lose interstseems like every game blizzard puts out turns to gold
this is no exception
visually this game is great to look at
the game play and control are much better than the first one
there are also  character classes to choose from and with  acts to play this game is way bigger than the first
the online game is a little choppy and laggy at times but well worth checking out
i loved the first diablo then your gonna lust for this game as you get deeper and deeper into the world known as diablo  the next time you look up at the clock you may not believe what your seeing
somehow you lost a couple of days playing
this game is that engrossing
buy this game and you wont be disappointedthis is definatly the best game i have ever played for anything any gamer  shouold never go without a copythis game is incredibly addictive
if you are sick of diablo  dont think you will be bored of diablo   the same great gameplay is back only highly refined and expanded  times
you can literally play the entire thing through  times and not see everythingfor those of you who havent played diablo it is basically an rpg version of solitaire  very simple very repeditive and very addictive
the perfect game for blowing  minutes at lunch but beware  you might take the rest of the day offthe backdrop of the game is breathtaking
you will travel through dark caves desert tombs monasteries deserted cities jungles ancient mayan temples with undead priests assaulting you in waves and even the rivers of hell
the final showdown with diablo is  times better than the original
the story that ties everything together is well not as deep as other rpgs but still spellbinding
the ending will have you begging for dand once you finish it you can play it again
this game has the most replay value of any rpg ever
first it is actually fun to play over and over
secondly diablo  has five highly unique character classes which all play differently and within each class are  skills which would take you  levels to explore
youll want to finish the game  times with each characterfinally battlenet rocks
you are basically getting a mmorpg for free without the monthly fee
get online meet your friends form a party and hop on a game
incredibly simple
the games gets dynamically tougher as more players join and you will never feel like there are more players then there are monsters
forget camping or taking  months to level  diablo  lets you have fun immediately and doesnt slow down
during launch everyone was trying to use it at the same time but now things have calmed down significantlythis game is the best rpg i have ever played
i personally think it  should be rated t there isnt enough blood to make it a m but thats just  my opinion
anyway the gameplay is awesome
with hundreds of items and  tons of skills and stats to improve your character this game has a long  play time
plus you can compete against friends or a complete stranger  over the internet over their unique gameplay system
all you need is an  internet provider and a modem
this game is awesome
i would recommend it  to anyonediablo ii has been around quite a while now but it remains in my mind the greatest game ever made
i was one of many who waited impatiently for untold months for blizzard to finish the sequel to the original diablo and i was by no means disappointed
blizzard does not release a game until it is really ready for prime time
the most amazing thing about this game is its disarming simplicity
all you need is a mouse and a finger to click with yet the action is often intense and the experience completely absorbing
when you get right down to it killing demons and other nefarious beasts is just plain fun
the game can get rather difficult at times yet this is a game that even i inept player that i am have actually been able to complete all on my ownthis game took everything good about the original diablo and just multiplied it
you now have four entirely different regions to explore each featuring a number of npcssome more helpful than others
youve still got your basic dungeon campaigns but you also get to explore wild forests desert sands and ethereal regions somewhere between earth and the netherworld
your choices of how to fight are varied indeed you can choose to fight as one of five different hero types each of which requires its own unique strategy
i tend to stay with the barbarian because i find it the easiest to control its all about slicing and dicing
if you want to use a lot of magic you have to do a lot more clicking in order to change spells and refresh your mannawhen you are surrounded by demons this can get rather difficult
the npcs afford you a lot of choices in terms of armor and weapons but of course you have to earn the cash to pay for the highdollar stuff by slaughtering untold demon hordes
the monsters you encounter in your travels are diverse and sometimes daunting
you have to use a little skill or a lot of luck to defeat some of the premier baddies you will run across but one advantage this game offers is the aid of a companion
when the going gets tough a partner firing arrows left and right can be a great help
if you worry about the length of the game rest assured that there is action enough to keep you clicking for untold hours
there are four parts to the game with very cool introductory sequences each one featuring about  different areas and six significant quests
finishing the game will take some a lot of time and effort but it can be done as soon as you finish though you are ready to dive back in and do the whole thing all over againthere is only one negative thing i can say about diablo ii
death can find you very quickly yet you cannot save the game as you go along and return to the exact same spot later
when you load a saved game you start at the central location of the region and have to make your way back the hard way to the spot you previously occupiedthe status of your quests is unchanged and you can still see areas you have visited but its annoying to have to trek through a couple of lands just to get back to where you already werediablo ii is incredibly addicting you may sit down planning on playing an hour or two and the first thing you know youve been fighting evil for four or five hours and you still arent ready to stop
if you enjoy online gaming the danger of obsession only grows
blizzards free battlenet online gaming service remains the standard by which all other online gaming services are judged
blizzard does everything the right way and diablo ii is a shining example of their commitment to the thoughts and desires of the gaming community
twenty years from now i will still be playing diablo iilord of terrorwhen diablo came out almost  years ago it was the surprise hit of the  one day there wasnt diablo the next it was on store shelves and the day after north american productivity plummeted 
although blizzard liked to classify it as a rpg it wasnt really one
more like an actionrpg since so much of the game relied on reflex and mouseclicking
the story development was slim and roleplaying aspects nonexistent
yet the simple addictive gameplay hooked us all and had us begging for moreafter years of development a few promises a few leaked features and dozens of delays  diablo ii is here
the second coming of hell and another dip in all it stocks came to my desk less than a week ago and grudgingly i accepted the job of reviewing the gamefor those of you whove been in a timewarp the past  years and never heard of diablo or diablo ii let me give you a brief rundown on bothdiablodiablo was a game where you played a hero of one of three character classes  warrior sorcerer or rogue
this hero operated out of a small town called tristram underneath which hell itself was opening up
at first simply trying to clear the local corrupted cathedral of vermin infestation the hero soon discovers that something much more sinister is afoot
hence you keep going deeper and deeper through the game until you discover that none other than the lord of terror himself  diablo  is at the root of all the problems
you see he along with his two other brothers  form the three prime evils
they got banished from hell by lesser evils and then rampaged around the world until they were captured in soulstones given to mortals by the angel tyraelthrough  different dungeons having  levels each you fought died and recovered your own corpse
youd restart the game when it got too hard to gain xp in easier areas and go back in again
it was all about getting to the next level getting the next spell getting the next better weapon or armor
it was simple to the point of being idiotic
click the mouse to move somewhere then clickclickclickclickclick at some monster until it dies and move on to kill more
thats an oversimplified description of course  but the point is that diablo was extremely addictiveif you liked dungeoun siege or divine divinity type games but never played this classic do so today
you get get it anywhere for super cheap and its so fun and addictive
for those who like more in depth stories and less clickity clicking go pick up fallout  planescape torment arcanum or morrowind
but if you want superclicking leveluping and finding more powerful weapons armours and magicks then this addictive clickfest of killing the damned creatures from the pits of the hells is the game for yougo back to the time when this action rpg ruled the world
it still does because its still fun and awesome and see how long your sucky ass lasts in hell mode babywow
as of this moment i have finished the game on normal difficulty and am about halfway through it again on nightmare difficulty
and having a blastif you prefer deep thought provoking games with amazing plot  twists and mindbending puzzles this is not the game for you
diablo ii  like diablo is pure hackandslashtreasureaccumulating mayhem
it is not  intellectual but it is great funthe new character classes are unique  and interesting
my favorites so far are the amazon since you can kill the  monster at range before it ever hits you and the sorceress because  well she has all that cool magic
im not so sure about the necromancer  who runs around with dead things but the paladin and the barbarian appear  to be great melee combatantsthe new item system builds on the system in  diablo
on top of stuff like obsidian amulet of stability you can also  find set items which are several items which if worn together have some  sort of bonus associated with them
however its difficult to put a set  together and the bonus is not always worth the effort
also you can find  seven different types of gems each of which can be one of five different  qualities chipped flawed et al each gem gives a certain ability to a  weapon a helmet or a shield including increased stats increased  elemental defense increased chance to find magic itemson the down  side the game can bog down horribly to the point where literally several  seconds can go by between your actions
there have already been two  patches in the first two weeks and rumor has it another patch is on the  way
the online gaming via battlenet is often down and even when you can  get connected there is often severe lag on top of the slow down i already  mentioned and often you will lose your connectionoverall great game
i highly recommend it
my only suggestion is that if you go on battlenet  try to keep your sense of humori admit i never played the first diablo but that was only because i had a low end pc and it couldnt support it and by the time i did upgrade it it was two years after and my graphics card couldnt handle the old game
so once diablo  hit the shelves i decided not to miss the chance this time
and am i glad i didnt this game rocks
first off the character choices are pretty diverse each of the characters has his or her own special ability which means you dont get the same powers in all the characters
my favorite is the necromancer because he can bring back the dead and summon other creatures from the earth
there are about five classes to choose from and each one of them has a set of magic or physical powers which you can upgrade as you gain experiance from killing monsters and collecting items
the graphics although i never actually played the first diablo are a major improvement
the lightening and rain effects give the game some major atmosphere and the music is great as well especially in the first level in the caves it has a sort of white zombie tone to it
overall i cant think of one bad thing about this game single player wise
multiplayer though is a different story
i tried the server a couple times and at the start of the game i would get booted for no apparent reason not mention all the players usually frag me no questions asked
this got very annoying and to tell you the truth it didnt interest me that much anyway
so i just stuck with the single player
its still plenty of fun and extremely challengingthis is a great game with good reply value even though some do not find it
ther is  ifferent characters barbarianrun in and keep hitting untill everything is dead drink some reds and youre fine againnecromancer send your skeletons and golemswho will become very powerful as you gain levels and yes you do get experience for  monsters your quotpetsquotkilledto fight for youpaladin run in and keep hitting everything in the name of good untill everything is deaduse less reds but more healing and such aurasamazon stand next to the doorway and kill everything with ranged weapons like javelins and arrows fall back to get some space between you and the monster if you have tosorceressssame as amazon but use ranged spells instead anduse some magic shields to protect yourselfthe game has countless monsters and they are much more dangerous in big groups than alone
the game has different skills for each character which help you to decide your characters pathex do you want your barbarian to be a sword master thus forcing him to use  hand swords and giant swords or master of clublike weapons which would force him to use double axes and maul there is a countless number of magical items unique items item sets and rarte items
all of them have different things to ad to yuo and you may try and get a certain collectionfor example in act  it is possible to get a set of items that arent supposed to be a set but they are all thorned and as such cause damage to the enemy just by hitting you and you can get fortune set which would give you a fast way of getting rare unique and magical items etc the games map does change with different characters which may get confusing but it adds to the replay value
waypoints are spaced apart but if you can get to one then the whole area between those  waypoints becomes sort of easier since you have the ability to retreat to a town at any moment
youd do have to quit the game to save and it will leave you back in the city with all the monsters when you restart but if those monsters didnt restart you would ahve a lot more trouble getting experience
and it is just obvious to start in a safe zonediablo ii is simply one of the most addictive gaming experience you will  ever have
like diablo the interface is extremely easy to get used to so  you can concentrate on your adventure without worrying about the controls
even though the graphics look much like the original the art work in  diablo is definitely praiseworthy
each act looks unique conpared to the  other ones
the five classes provide you with a wide range of abilities and  attributes to develop and use against the evil forces
one major minus  though unlike diablo you cannot really save in diablo  when you do save  and exit the monsters regenerate themselves
this forces you to finish  the fight once you start it
other than this inconvenience diablo  is  definitely one of the best actionrpg game everthis is the best game ever made the replay value is unbeatablenuff saiddiablo  was fun and addicting
however with duping the ability to duplicate any item ingame everything got just way too easy
you could beat diablo without much of a thought as everybody had the most powerful of weaponsdiablo ii is much more challenging as that bug has been resolved
the graphics are improved and the ability to learn only a certain number of skills adds a real strategic portion to the gamethe best thing is that the game is pretty cheapand you can go and play with your friends online as much as you want
thats right no monthly fees just all you can eative created and built many highlevel characters
the game doesnt get boring in a hurry and ive found replay to be extremely high
there are so many challenges and so many routes to go that it forces you to put a lot of thought into your characterafter playing for several years i think im going to graduate to world of warcraft also by blizzard which ive noticed is quite similar in many ways
but im sure i will return to the world of diablo quite often as there are still a few challenges left to conqueri bought this game last week
little did i know the battle chest came out a day after i bought it
needless to say i feel a little cheated on that partdiablo  is perfect for those gamers who just want to throw down into some hacking and slashing
the battle strategies arent difficult to master and the game itself is easy to immerse yourself into
the sheer variety of equipment you can purchasefind will keep you interested in the game
i have found that the best way to play this is on battlenet
you can trade equipment and items with other players there
it adds another interesting aspect to the game itself
once you play on battlenet you will not want to play a single player game
you will stay up late playing this game i promise youthere are really no gripes that i have about this game although i wish i had just bought the battle chest instead
it comes with the expansion a strategy guide and the original diablo for just  more dollars
so if you are going to buy this game you might as well front the extra  and get it allwith this sequel blizzard has kept everything that i liked about the  original and reworked and improved most of the things i disliked about the  originalprobably the best thing about this game is the new selection of  characters and the skill system
with the amazon will you focus on close  combat with jabbing weapons and some ranged attacks from throwing them or  will you go for all ranged attacks with bow and crossbow
will your  necromancer specialize in summoning many undead and other monsters to do  his dirty work for him or will he take more of a direct role by using  curse spells on his enemies
every character class faces lots of choices  like these which to me really boosts the replay valuesome people have  complained of technical glitches
i have found diablo ii to be one of the  smoothest least buggy games ive played
zero problems so far
i dont  doubt that these other folks have had problems but my experience has been  differentsome people complain that the quests require no thought to  solve
theyre right but i dont think the quests are intended to be  puzzles
they help link the action into the backstory and they provide  some variety and build suspense is andariel on this level
how hard is she  going to be
being able to hire followers or summon them if youre  playing a necromancer is very cool
theyre pretty smart about staying  with you way more useful than the sidekicks in daikatana or the golems  from diablosome people have complained that its too much like the  original diablo
well duh excuse me this is a sequel folks
if you  didnt like the original you probably wont care for this game either
one reviewer complained about spending too much time chasing down monsters  that ran from him
to that i say two things
first most of the monsters  are very inyourface and try to swarm you except for the ones with ranged  attacks which very smartly try to keep their distance
second that guy  must not be very good at the game  you have to be able to deal with ranged  combat situations as well as close combat you have to work the terrain to  your advantage
sounds like that guy got unhappy as soon as his only  strategy hit a spot where it didnt workthere are a few things i wish  i had done better
i do wish that they could have improved the graphics  resolution at least optionally for those of us with high end  machinesusing way stations and town portals is a little unnatural
the  way stations are like permanent town portals in specific places but if you  use them to travel the monsters in that area repopulate
town portal  spells meanwhile dont persist when you save and quit and quitting while  out in the wilderness drops you back in towncamp
this makes it so there  are times when id like to take a break or need to shut down the game but  im reluctant to
restarting from the saved game would involve fighting my  way through areas ive already done so sometimes i wind up pausing the  game for hours until i can get back to it
this is silly to make us jump  through hoops like thatthe graphics are not the greatest anyone has seen but no other game provides as many hours of fun as diablo ii does
one of the real advantages of this game is you can just install it and play
you dont have to read a book the size of war and peace to understand how to play
you level up at a rate that makes you want to never stop playing
this game also has the perfect balance of magic items and different things to make you want to keep adventuring
ive played it all the way through with every character class and enjoyed a different experience each time
i bought the expansion pack and played each character through that
im waiting for another expansion or something
i just cant get enough of this game
every blizzard game released is a good quality game
if your sick of getting games that dont work that well or are full of bugs before and after patches are appliedie buldars gate the new pool of radiance you can find comfort in the fact that blizzard doesnt release garbage software in a cool box
they put excellent software in a cool box
they also provide great quality free online play at battlenet
blizzard is a topnotch company devoted to topnotch gaming software
blizzard is a member of an elite group of software companies that take pride in their productseverything went well
i got the game it works
i played it for over a month now no problems at allthis game is without a doubt one of the most addictive games ever released
the enjoyment you get from developing your character and watching as he or she kills all of the evil creatures is indescribable
with this game you have more options availible for your character with five  classes and thirty skills for each
also when you complete the game once  you are given the option to play in nightmare mode which is harder but  much more powerful items are dropped
after that there is hell mode which  is very hard and there is even better weapons and items
all of this on top  of terrific multiplayer adds up to very good value for your gaming dollar
the only flaws in this game are the less than spectacular graphics which  arent horrible but they could have been better
also the hardcore rpg  crowd might not like this game as it is more action oriented and doesnt  have the intricate character customization that quottruequot rpgs  have
if this was a review for that type of game it wouldnt have gotten  five stars but taken for what it is which is actionrpg you cant find a  better gamei played the original diablo on the mac and this version on a wintel system
the game is varied and challenging
i tried the barbarian class and found it to be a lot of simple zombie smashing fun
if you like action in a fantasy setting diablo ii is a great rideblizzard achieved what seemed impossible keep diablos spirit add some unique features expand character development capabilities lengthen the story mystery awesome graphics and sound for another total immersion ok there may have been one minor detail i would have liked kept from the original the way quests were given with large golden letters slowly scrolling on screen while being read by a great voice very very minoranother true classiclet me just start by saing this when i first got this game i played for  hours straight
i can only type this because battle net is down right now
this game is more addictive then crack
if you liked diablo at all you  will love this game
it is more of the same but it is great
nothing  comes closes to the feeling of diablo   i cant stop playing
second  if you never played diablo try the demos of the orignal they are about the  same only diablo  is better
third this game like most games is not  perfect
there have been many bugs and many bugs are still out there
but  the fact of the matter is that they got most of the worst ones out in the  first two patches
so it is pretty sweet right now
fourth the only  really negative thing you can say about this game is that battlenet the  internet version of it is down more then i like
but this is only the  first month once they get the bugs out they should have a totally  excellent gaming engine
fifth
if you have not gone out to get this  game you are missing out on a great game
it is not the next doom but the  orignal diablo changed the industry and the new diablo  is still rocking
if you like rpg and such you will love diablo   if you dont like rpg  then try anyways i was never a fan before these games  if you hate rpg  please move along and find other games
one final word of warning
make  sure to have a weekend coming up when you get this game because it is so  addictive
and have fun because this is the game of the yearthe legendary diablo or  years after its release the genre defining hackandslash rpg
still played by many
addictive epic and funcombined with the expansion the best itemloot system in any game eversimply speaking this game is about items obtaining them using them etc they can make or brake a character combatwise
they can increase your mana or hp pool  times they can make your skills several times more powerful than if you wouldnt had them etc
items ranging from ordinarily common to so rare and unique you may never see them dropthe range and spectrum of statsattributes on items is enormousskillabilities system second only to guild wars imoamazing art style graphically
lots of shiny jsimple linear story
there are about  quests altogether and most are obligatory for advancing the gamedifficulty ranges from stupidly easy to insanely hardmax lvl is  and because of exponential lvling curve it takes lots of grind to reach itonline economy in this game is complex
it suffered lots of abuse and different kinds of exploits by less then honest playersgame patchesupdates changed many things in the game over and over againthe sheer amount of hours involved to become great are staggering
very addictive
bugs are tolerable
battlenet is over sold thou and needs to upgrade badlyalso hackers are rampant star for offline play stars for online play stars for battlenetwow that game is addicting
i started playing and for some reason i didnt stop for like  months
so much stuff in the game your head will spin
blizzard has really done it this time
a little different from the original diablo but its all good
wow
and the expansion is wowwarning
game is highly addicting
only play if you have a lot of time on your hands
friends and family may look at you and friends weird when you talk about it for hours sobewareif you think pc games are all show and no go these days then think again
diablo ii brings to the table addictive almost oldschool type gameplay it even reminded me of zelda at times rich sound effects an involving storyline and adequate enough visuals to complement them that it will keep you hooked for hours on end
i havent played the first diablo so diablo ii was my introduction to the seriesin diablo ii you get to choose from five character classes which are barbarian sorceress amazon paladin and necromancer
each class is unique and has its strengths and weak points
for example the barbarian is great at closeup combat but is poor in the magic department and the sorceress is almost completely magicdependant whereas paladin has equal amounts of both
this game is divided into quotactsquot which are subdivided to various missions
you start off at a rogue encampment in act i and then move onto the desert town of quotlut gholeinquot in act ii which is as far as i went before being deprived of my copy due to the addiction
i had a little trouble conquering the quotarcane sanctuaryquot with paladin
aside from doing what you are told by townsfolk you can also buy and trade weopons armour headwear belts and numerous other items which proves to be half the fun of the game
you can store some of your gear in your private quotstashquot found in each town as well as keep a fair amount with you during your missions
to make things less nervecracking the game makes use of quotwaypointsquot so that when a new area is discovered and if its waypoint is found even if you die you can warp right there again
also if you die once and quotsave and exitquot the game your corpse will be in the town in the next game so all the weopons and items can be recollected
its a very wise decision to make during the harder more remote missionsthe visuals though not upto current standards are quite adequate
they dont need much improving at all
the sound effects and voices are quite crisp too
also prepare for all the gore you crave for whether it be bashing up a quotquillratquot a quotsabercatquot or one of the games many bosses
there are various skills to be learnt which are unique to each character as well as various shrines that refill life magic increase your combat skills or improve protection temporarily plus a few morediablo ii is a very big very involving and very addictive game with a lot of tasks to perform and a vast amount of weopons and rare items to be found so anyone is going to have hisher hands full
and i am rating it five stars by playing it only halfway through
thats saying a lota while back i did a review of this game
i said it had nothing to do with an rpg and it was basically killing everything with no plot development
than i realized the brillance of this game and it was wrapped up in one wordsimplicitysimple gameplay equals fun gameplay
keep it short and sweet
so now i must say i love this game
it has really good graphics for  i always liked the graphics and the gameplay is simple and addictive
i was a complete idiot to say it sucked
well now i knowthe story of the lord of terror continues with  new player classes amazing spells and effects an incredible musical score and very addictive gameplaythe story begins on a darker notethe town of tristram the very location of the first battle with diablo has been stricken with a terrible fate as the very hero who defeated him seems to be harboring a great curseand as he travels eastward this dark wanderer leaves behind him a wake of evil spreading throughout the landsenter the heroic paladin the mighty barbarian the mysterious necromancer the quick and agile amazon and the elementallypowered sorceress
these  character classes each have  unique skill trees all of which have powerful skills that your characters can perfect which lends easy customization of your characterfor example you can have a necromancer who is unmatched in raising the dead to do his bidding or one that is a master of dark spells or a mixture of both
tons of enemies block your path with literally thousands of magical unique and set items that players will find themselves hunting for throughout the game
battlenet capability makes diablo ii a very entertaining experience both off and onlinethe paladin is the definitive choice for those that want to lead a party
with a tree of deadly attack skills and  trees of auras which enable the paladin to enchant himself and other party members with defensive or offensive abilities he is a force to be reckoned with
a great choice for those who favored the warrior in the first diablo but wanted magical skills as wellthe barbarian is easily the most formidable fighter in the game
immense strength and agility make this character very hard to kill
his skill trees include battle cries which can be used to power himself and party members as well as cause damaging effects to enemies
he has a tree of attack skills which include the ability to bash and knock enemies back dizzying them or leaping into a group of enemies with enough force to scatter them
his third tree consists of masteries which allow him to increase his ability to wield sword mace and axe class weapons as well as the ability to search corpses for potions and treasurethe amazon is a quick and nimble warrior with the mastery of spear and ranged weapons
she also benefits from spiritual abilities and excellent attacks
the perfect choice for those that were fans of the rogue class in the first diablothe sorceress is no different than the sorcerer of the first game save the fact that she learns her elemental magics fire ice and lightning on each individual tree
players can choose to master one tree or blend all three to have an excellent elemental warriorthe necromancer is by far the most unique and mysterious of all the classes
he has the evil ability to raise the dead making the corpses of his foes into skeletal slaves
he also benefits from  trees worth of magical attack spells which do incredible damage if trained properly
however the ability to raise undead minions to do your bidding is the best aspect of the necromancer
it may seem at times that you are being swarmed by an unprecedented number of enemies on screen at once
all you have to do is continue to train your summoning skills and soon youll have your enemies on the run with your own personal army of the undeadthese  diverse classes alone are worth playing the game over multiple times
when you beat the game a harder difficulty opens up and new more powerful items and creatures are yours to discoverthe cinematics are breathtaking
blizzard once again delivers by giving us excellent quality and story telling
each act is followed by a cinematic that spans anywhere from    minutes long
some of the events that occur in these cinematics will send chills down your spine especially the end of act ivthe gameplay is very addicting and you will find yourself looking at the clock and watching hours go by as if they were minutes
there strange thing is that it is nothing remarkablego kill do quest and gain experience
perhaps themost entertaining aspect is the multiplayer which keeps the game going no matter how many times youve beaten it
the bottomline get it
you will love it
a great story great voice acting and tons of items and creatures to discover make this game well worth your time and moneythere have been many trys by different developers to copy the play style of diablo   they are no doubt good but they are not diablo   diablo  has the best story fun factor sound cinematics addictiveness and replayability
i stopped playing this a long time ago because i was hooked on starcraft but i am going to start a new character tonight just to see how fun this game is again
my previous barbarian only got up to lvl   ive been playin wow and have a lvl  alliance human paladin but there is not nearly as much loot as there is in diablo  thus making many characters look the same
to the post below all mmorpgs require a fee to playits what basically gets them paid to make updates fix the servers etc
cant wait to start diablo  againthis is simply a superb game and is very stable dont listen to those who have said it does not run it has more to do with their machine than with the game
anything i did not like about the first has been changed in this game like the ability to run this is a god sendthis game has a rich story line superb game play great graphics awesome movie cutaways that are truly stunning and an increased array of characters to use
the character skill progressions are much more diverse as well and call into play some real strategy and forward thinking
i especially love the necromancer who can summon skeletons golems etc
to fight along side him
the attention to detail on the characters look is also very satisfying whatever you wear directly influences your characters appearance on the screen unlike the first game where the look was somewhat generic
you can also hire npcs to fight along side of you at various stages of the game which also adds depthi also enjoy the chapter structure of the game that brings you to different towns and wilderness areas
it reduces the repetitivness of the first gamethe maps of the levels are truly vast as well which makes the game much more challenging and interesting and the fact that many are outdoors desert jungle highlands woods temple ruins and finally hell as opposed to spending the entire game in one long dungeoni tell you that i am not a big fan of real time games or arcade type shooters but this game holds your attention for untold hours and is replayable
i have completed it with  of the four characters before burning out a bit
i look forward to playing the expansion and using the assassin and monkthe online play is vastly improved from the first
with a dsl connection it is virtually indistinguishable from the solo version and funtrust me get this gameafter such a wait blizzard entertainment has been able to conquer the software world of roleplaying again
diablo ii is not only entertaining to play but also very realistic
the scenes and details shadows background noises creature attacks etc
were some of the best i played
the playability of the game was very understanding and easy to get use to
i used two characters on my excursion to kill diablo
i used the paladin and the sorcerer
i found that the paladin had an easier time to kill and move forward in the game
although he did not have the combination spells which that made the sorcerer fun
the st scene of the game rogue encampment was a time to understand the various new tools and capabilities that the game had to offer
as i mentioned i had some trouble getting use to the sorcerer
the paladin plowed through the levels
the quests and the way that they lead in the game were intuitive
the nd scene lut gholeim was very impressive in the desert
the method that blizzard changed the scenery was very creative compared to the previous version
instead of going lower and lower in the ground they kept the game above the surface
i liked the fact that you can speak to more people who gave you hints on how to play the game and find new items
i will not give the whole game away but i must say that if you want to finish the game fast play with the paladin or if you prefer a challenge then go with the sorcerer
have fun i read some of the reviews and most people said this game was okay but  not as good as the original
boy were they wrong
this game far surpasses  the original diablo to me
the levels are designed better and the quests  are more interesting to follow
the cinematic movies are to die for
the  graphics are improved a little from the originalfor instance you can see  the items you are wearing
the only complaint is that there are a few bugs  in the game such as graphic slow downs and i had to go to bizzardcom to  download a patch just to get the game to run on my computer
other than  these few gripes i am addicted to this game
until i got diablo ii i had  no idea how fun rpgs are
thanks blizzard for another great gameyou know the drill get equipped buy enough potions and town portal scrolls find the teleport place outside as you progress through quest and level up in meantime
simple yet addictive animated graphic that looks decent after  years hours that pass buy and almost no glitches even on xp change resolution to x and install d acceleration if it doesnt workthis game is cult classic with reasonoh yeah if you wanna play like sorceress there is unrecoverable on second stage after beating six quests unless you have magic that takes out  percent of enemys energy
just loved barbarian characteri think its quite customary for people to critize a game once it is massively successful
there will always be that  who will dedicate their life to critizing and hating it
its human nature and this is because everyone wants to sound like an expert
those who hate diabloii just hate it to sound like a critic
after all who would know better than an expert rightdiablo is diablo  just  times bigger
the graphics are average however
now the reason why the graphics are not much of an improvement is due to the fact that this game was started  years ago
now its a huge game and the second and third acts are actually gorgeous
the last act is breath taking in grpahics aswell
the first act is a bit dissapointing however is it fun
the answer is a simple yes
how much fun
the answer is more addictive than crack
the rpg elements are alright the customization is excellent
the prime fun is the action
its addictive and having fun is the main objective
thats what you have fun
this game is not for you if you are more into the strategic rpgs like baldurs gate
but if you want a game which gives you a lot of action based fun this masterpiece is for you
the only lows besides the graphics are that after  hours of addictive playin you realize that all you are doing is clicking
but my word its a lot of funi first played this game at my neighboors house
the day that i played it i knew that it was a must buy
even without the internet it was tons of fun and when i got the net it was even funner
however d has some flaws
if you dont have enough ram it is quite possible that you can die because of time used while the computer thinks
battlenet on this game is great
blizzerd made it so there is almost no lag at all when you play
you need to buy this gamethis is great but you really need to buy the expansion pack
the extra features make the game worth it
i have been playing for too many weeks now and need to stop but i canthad enough of your real life
had enough of the sims
then get your  computer chewing on diablo ii as soon as possible
every second you delay  keeps you from enjoying another creative wonder from blizzard
be prepared  to use your brain as well
this game will force you to make important  decisions before and during gameplay
while this may frustrate some lazy  gamers blizzard knew that a little extra strategy and a lot of user  choices are all part of a great gaming experienceplus an amazon in  shining armori played this game when it came out in  and enjoyed it
i didnt play it past  i finish a game and stop but the discs had been kicking around since then
i installed it again a week or two ago and am half way finished the single player
here are my impressions of this game in  graphics are tolerable
yes its only x and on a widescreen monitor there are black bars to the side but the graphics arent horid incredibly fast loads
even on a laptop that im playing on its no surprise the thing loads absurdly fast still fun
i never ever play old gamesthis is probably the first
i always play the newest stuff but this mindless button smash fest is still fun even to this day
the game is simple easy to pick up and play for  minutes or  it just works
heck they were still patching it until march of  plays on windows  fine for me
this is on a hp dv pavilion laptop
the game loads looks fine i can alttab back and forth though sometimes the mouse if i alttab back to desktop will be weird and still kind of trapped in the game
really no big deal thoughthere is a good reason this game has been so well acclaimed
it has a very certain balanced purity to the play
its hard to really pin point but when you start killing monsters youre immediately hooked and the leveling is very satisfying
the game has a darn near if not right on perfect balance of leveling vs monster difficulty you level up get some more skills or weapons and its more or less just in time to take on the harder monsters
this is something even a top tier modern title like skyrim hasnt been able to matchdiablo  is coming out at some point so many delays i dare not guess
if they can more or less take diablo  juice the graphics expand the breadth of monsters levels etc
but keep the core game play and concept is it was theyll have another winner
sometimes simple is betterunlike most pc gamers i never played the first diablo
with all the hype and how much my friends enjoyed the first game i figured this would be the game to buy
well it is
the fun and reaplayability factors definitely  make up for the less than stellar graphics in this game
the controls and  gameplay are superb
the sound and music is some of the most realistic  ive ever heard except for some of the recent fps games
i havent  played on battlenet yet simply because im having too much fun playing my  own game and tcpiping with my buddies
me and my friends started our  game after we were halfway through with act  in our own games and we were  amazed at how much fun we were having even though it was our second time  through act   when you play online with others it proposes a whole new  slew of options like trading etc
teamwork
what makes the game so  replayable is that everytime you play it its different
even if you play  as the same character you will end up getting weapons in a different  order
the weapons and magic are just awesome by the way
its so cool  how killing the same enemies over and over and over again can be so much  fun
usually i hate normal rpg games but this action rpg stuff is my bag   babyit takes place after the end of the original diablo
at the end of diablo diablo the lord of terror was defeated
the hero then takes diablos soul stone a device that is used to bind the soul of any demon or angel and puts it into his own body hoping to contain his soul for all eternityahh diablo
once again blizzard software has proven their ability to make a game that absolutely engrosses the user and raises the bar for other developers out there
diablo i spawned a slew of clones following the  success of its actionrpg hybrid but the only game that could really  dethrone diablo was you guessed it diablo iigameplay first
blizzard has expanded the number of available character types to  with  more magetype classes and a fightermage paladin
as you gain experience  points you are still able to place your experience points in general  categories that boost your mana strength dexterity etc
it helps in  placing your experience points to know how you want your character to  develop
for example if your paladin is going to be a fighter youll  want to boost his strength and dexterity
still youll want to boost his  mana as well in order to take advantage of his magical abilities
for the  necromancer and the sorceress mana is clearly the way to go
for the  barbarian strength and for the amazon strength and dexteritythe  skill tree is also insanely expanded with unique skills for each class
there are so many skills you need to pick a few to specialize in so that  you can rock with them when the time comes
spread your skill points too  thin and youll be kinda good at too many things and not good enough at  anythingthe skills alone make for a replayable game but there is much  much more to dii
the terrain is once again randomized but much more so  than the original
ive started four separate games and the terrain has  been different every time
the quests are more of a driving force in dii  causing you to focus on your task while sweeping through the huge levels
the entire act i is bigger than the first gamethere are a plethora of  unique and magical items none of which i have seen repeated yet
there is  also the new concept of quotsocketedquot weapons and armor which  allows the player to socket magical gems into their weapons and gain  bonuses from fire damage to lifestealing
the unique items also change  the way your character looks which means the player has more of a  connection with their character and keeps them on the lookout for items  which may look cool when placed on the characterthe monsters are  excellent varying widely in size shape type and ability
there are  plenty of unique monsters who drop nifty magical and sometimes unique  itemsand if all that wasnt enough the story is artfully woven into  the game told between acts with beautifully rendered cutscenes and inact  by npcs and events as they unfold before you
in the first act you connect  with some of the people from the first game though you may notice some  differencesi have been playing this game so much that youd think i was  sick of it by now
guess again im just raring to get back home and play  some moreand finally if the single player wasnt engrossing enough  multiplayer coop mode is excellent and quite enjoyable
you can party with  as many as seven other people though it does get crowded
 and share  experience points as you clean out the levels
all in all diablo ii has  enough replayablilty for the next three years of my gaming lifeand  finally the graphics
well many people have slammed the graphics saying  they havent changed at all
not true especially if you own a good d  card
while its true the game runs in x   colors if you stop  and think about it could this game really work at higher resolutions
many items are already tough to pick up let alone see though the alt key  makes that much easier in dii and at x the game might be  invisible
plus there are nifty spell effects for us d card owners and  once you get out of the first act the game stops looking so much like  diablo i and starts really taking shapebottom line  buy it
play it
join meamazing is what i would say best describes it
i have the first one and the land in diablo ii is x the size of diablo i and just as fun to explore
blizzard improved on the cast having a lot more balance to each unique chacter with each having unique skills spells i give it five stars its amazing
the only drawbacks are that it is more complicated to get on battlenet and you will lose a lot of sleep
buy it
if you want more info on it email me at jwpcscomat first diablo ii seems very out of date in graphic quality and the linear plot but it indeed is a excellent game
and it is a very  playeroriented game
i am now in act iii from the very beginning i do not  refer to user manualeverything you need is clearly shown on the neat  control panel
the most important and successful is diablo ii bring us  back to the very essence of rpg to explore to fight to enjoy the  otherworld
it avoids the boring complex weapon and armour setting like  ultima avoids lots of unused magic like most rpg avoids meaningless  quest like mampm
only pure explore and direct quest
you know what you  are doing now
its so addictive that today i played it from  am to   pm oh my finger achesthis game is the ultimate game ever inventedother then fable but im sure you already know i love fable having read my other reviews
diablo  has soooooooooooo many good things about it i dont even know where to begin
actually assuming you are a very busy person and dont have time to read chapter books i will just say thisplay it yourself and see for yourself if this isnt the best gaming expierence youve had in your life
trust me if you get me started i wont even stop talking bout diablo  dont believ me
just ask my poor sisters haha
but seriosly though the best part of this game is the replay value
on a scale of  the replay is  im serios and you dont even knowunless youve played it then you probably do know see ya later reader and buy this gamebesides for the resolution which is still at a measly old x i really dont have many complaints there are  all new character classes two more than were available in the original diablo the save system is better and worse considering that unless you accidently or purposefully writeprotect your save file you are almost guaranteed not to lose progress
however you dont come back in the same spot and if you left items laying on the ground you wont find them again there are four different towns you operate out of at different points in the game each with their own textures
also the randoom dungeon layouts of diablo are back the chances of you finding another player like yours are really low even among the same character class
for example your sorceress can become a master of one of three elements and of different aspects of each element
for example some may put all their skill points into inferno while others prefer strengthening their knowledge of fire bolt or blaze
and while some would put more points into vitality and wear light armor others may put points into dexterity or whateverallinall diablo ii will definitely remain a favorite for a long timediablo  players
yes i know you have suffered but diablo  fixed all their problems and this game is  times better
get itd is a really funny game and it gets funnier on battlenetthe graphics is goodthe characters are cooli like the necromancerif you got broadband then i really recommend buy this game but even if you dont it is still good in single playerbuy it
periodget into it
stay into it
play online alwaysgreat replay value great character development superaddictive gameplayone of the best games out thereyou remember that game diablo
you know the original
that was the one with the repetitive dungeons and tiny overworld that bored you to death after about  days of playing
that was the one that after realizing that there wasnt gonna be some kind of twist that sent you into another land besides tristram you shut it off in disgust
what sums up diablo
one word
repetetivewell someone must have slipped blizzard the word cause they definately improved all that with the release of diablo ii
you start in a rogue encampment which is about the size of the town of tristram
at first i thought here we go again
but then i entered the blood moor then the cold plains then the burial grounds and at that point i realized that diablo ii takes place on a massive overworld with dungeons scattered throughout instead of being piled on top of one another
i completed the first quest and now i am already addicted to a game that i really didnt expect much fromdont listen to reviews that call diablo ii a game identical in gameplay to the original
heck i am about  into the game and already i have been through more of an overworld than  of the originalbuy this gameum it work good and ok with playstation to use that as no break or damage or whatever
ty muchi remember for some ps games i used the ps controller for it
the controller for the ps and ps did not chande much
these are great i love themif youve played any playstation console in the past fifteen years youve more than likely used a dualshock controller
what else can be said
its a good controller design
works with any playstationthe analog controller is great for a lot of different reasons
the vibration function is a really nice addition to the game
it may freak out a friend whos not expecting it which is quite fun to watch and adds a  nice dimension to games that support it
the analog controls are great  especially for driving games
the more precise control keeps you from  veering from side to side
the amount of buttons and fingers used may make  people who arent used to it uncomfortable but that doesnt seem like its  going to change anytime soonmy only complaint is that this control  isnt used enough
very few games call for the right stick
the one that  i know of is gpolice and it really adds to the gametheres no reason  to get a nonanalog controller when you can get the analog
it may cost a  bit more but its worth itthis product was of course very helpful since the ps i bought didnt come with the controllers
it functions very well and seems to be in pristine conditiongreat controller no bends twists in the cord no folding over of it at the top of the controller that is common among those of us who wrap the cord around the controller
the joysticks still have proper tension and no scuffsscrapes anywhere
and most importantly works great
great replacementps grey controller is the one which never gets old if you properly and carefully will own it
first original as always the best choicehow can you play playstation games without thisit rocks in making playstation games fun or boringit can vibratelet you play gamesand you should buy it so you can play those gamesthis is the controller i grew up with
same old moving capabilities and works great with racing games
this is a must have for any playstation addictits the playstaion controller
cmon do i really have to do a review
you need it to play your games
the funny thing is i used to prefer the controller that came with the ps the one with no analog sticks until i experienced the dual shock  i used to say what is that those big black lumps on the controller
im not getting that
aaaa man the good old daysthe memory card was exactly what was needed to save my playstation games
it was orginal equipment from sony
it works greatyes another memory card i dont even know how many the kids have lol this was a good buy the kids were happy to have itwith this memery card i could back up my memery saves because my brother loves to delete it i also used it to get extra cards in yugioh using the memery trickthis system is one of the greatest home consoles ever made
no joke
the controllers were and still are quite revolutionary about  of the games were quality and the graphics at the time were greatthe system is durable
not like the nes or snes or even the sturdy gamecube but it is still solid in that regardthe games are the focus thoughanyone with some sense could enjoyperfect darksuper mario mario kart pokemon stadiumpokemon stadium snowboard kids wave race goldeneye mario tennismario partymario party mario party star fox zelda ocarina of timezelda majoras maskturok jet force geminibomberman banjokazooiebody harvestsuper smash brospokemon puzzle leaguenfl blitz  the only real sports game i liked at the time
south parkconkers bad fur dayfighting forceif i could stamp this system with a  stars out of  stars i wouldthis is really the last system that nintendo made great after that the systems went down hill
the wii is terrible not the best graphics and the games are just so stupid
the game cube also the same thing as the wii
the  is the last true nintendo systemclassic d games at half the price of todays new games
you can not go wrong great for famliy and kidsthe n is one of the top  systems ever released by nintendo along with snes and wii
the game library is pretty large and boasts a variety of racers shooters and rpgsplatform rpgs
the n gave us that first glimpse of extremely open world game play and d characteristics
this was the last system to feature cartridge based games with quick load times
in an era when playstation was marketing their franchises like crash bandicoot and tomb raider nintendo took a more fun approach to the n
one of the greatest things about the n is that its built very sturdy and strong
the console and games can take a pretty good beating and still keep on working
there are a good variety of games that are fun for the whole family
i think this is a great console to own for anyone who was a gamer in the s or anyone looking for a starter console for their kidsif youre new to the n and looking for some suggestions heres a few must ownzelda ocarina of timemario mario kart donkey kong goldeneye banjo and kazooieharvest moon mortal kombat trilogystarfox zelda majoras maskever played n
if you havent your in for a treat
there are so many awesome classic games for this amazing system
youll be blown away by the fact that the grahpics are so good for a system as old as n
if you do purchase this system also purchase the following games super smash brothers diddy kong racing  pokemon stadium
those are my favorites
enjoy the n because i know i doammy beloved nthe console that ushered in a new era of awesomenessin direct competition to the newly arrived playstationfunny how this whole thing turned outaccording to gaming legend nintendo were supposed to collaborate with sony to create a new disc based consolethat deal fell through and the playstation was born while ninetendo released the nplaystation ended up whooping nintendo big time but its funny how the roles have now reversed with the wii and psanywaythe nwidely praised for a slew of stunning and ground breaking games
mario  zelda oracina of time and countless others made this a must own systemd graphics that stunned everyone including myselfa legend in the gaming businesssadly the system was also widely panned due to it still being cart based but who carescarts or cds what really mattered was the quality of the gamesand as always nintendo deliveredone of the best consoles ever and a must ownhighest recommendationsthings would have been drastically different if nintendo and sony had indeed joined forces without any fallout or drama
as the days of the super nintendo and sega genesis systems were winding down gamers were looking ahead to the next big thing in video gaming
sega was working on a new game console while nintendo and sony joined forces to bring out a new game console as well
however at the last minute nintendo and sony parted ways
nintendo decided that the business arrangements and agreements werent good for them and they secretly made a deal with phillips to make another game console
sony was so infuriated by this betrayal that they decided to enter the game console race themselves
the sony playstation was released to the public in the fall of  and faced off against the sega saturn
after its deal with phillips fell through nintendo released the nintendo  in  and for the first time they had an uphill battle on their handsthe nintendo  is a cartridge based console system that came bundled with one controller unique because no one ever saw a three handle controller designed quite like it did doing those times
it was also built with  controller ports so that up to  players can play at the same time thus ushering it the multi player party theme the n was associated with games made to support up to  players
though it was initially released as a black console nintendo released the n in other colors and also started bundling it with different games
later on they released the expansion pack which added  mb of processing power for third party developers to take advantage of
then came the rumble pack an accessory that you plugged into your controller and gives force feedback depending on what game you played
the n would be the last home console nintendo makes that uses cartridgesthe pros the n is a sturdy piece of equipment
its made of high quality and was meant to last for a very long time i would know i bought mine in  and to this date it still works
its very easy to snap on a cartridge or a controller so you will be playing quickly any time
also nintendos library of games is pretty impressive despite competition from the playstationthe cons like i said before the n uses cartridges
the sony playstation and sega saturn both used cds which was able to store more data and because of its media size its much bigger than what a n cartridge could hold
it was the main reason why most developers were willing to and able to develop more games for sony and sega while nintendo had limited third party support for much of its lifespan
in the end the ps game library was more diverse since certain franchises started with sonys system and never saw the light of day on the nnintendos battle with the playstation showed that they made some mistakes that would cost them dearly
they werent on top like they used to be lost die hard fans from the nessnes days and finally had to acknowledge sony as a worthy competitor in the video game world
despite all the setbacks nintendo were dealt with the n still managed to stay in the game and be the host to great nintendo games and excellent third party games from those developers who did show some support
if you were a fan of nintendo you bought a n
if you never did its a worthy investment since you can pick one up and several games at bargain prices
i still have my n and games so i take it out every once in a while
it brought a lot of good memories and reminds me of what happened during those times and how different the video gaming world is todaythis is my system of all time
it has great games like turokstar wars and more
so buy itso i got a n on amazon about a year ago
ive been wanting one since i was young
i love this old video game console
i think its a great system and there are fun games for it
its too bad that the old systems and games are forgotten as the new ones come
i know the wii is a great system and the wiiu is going to be the best
 but the old systems are still funthis system is as good as any system out today
but thats if you are judging it by its games
the games are great
you can buy games from the mario and sonic series as well as games about sports starfox and star wars
however as fun and enjoyable these games are you cant expect to play them with good graphics or online capabilities
but it still has the best graphics of its time
also since online capabilities for video games were unheard of in the mids you cant blame the system for not having them
overall it is a great fun and durable system and is worth every one of its five starsnintendos bit console may not have been the most popular of its generation but  in the games department  it may just be the greatest video game system ever made
while the controller is arguably a bit on the  how to put it  unusual side last i checked most people had only two  not three  hands the quality of this consoles construction is unrivalled
no system before or after the n has been more durable or more reliableas i mentioned before it is the selection of games that makes the n a musthave item even almost  years after its original release
games like super mario  banjo kazooie goldeneye perfect dark the legend of zelda ocarina of time the legend of zelda majoras mask mario kart  are all still some of the best games ever released
the system may be dated but the games are just as fun and just as mindblowing today as they were  years agoif you love to game do yourself a favor and pick up a nintendo  it may very well be the greatest console ever madei have owned this system for a couple of years i lost count and it still works
i havent had any problems yet and i still play it every now and then
even though the ps is my favorite n is still a classicthe games are very creative and alot of fun especially zelda those were the days
you wont need a multitap or a memory card since its in the game i suppose and there are no loading times
the controller is the only problem i have
after a couple hours of gameplay my hands get soar and hurt
maybe its because my hands are big
oh welloverall this is the kind of system anyone can enjoy and i highly recommend it along with the mario games zelda games james bond games and so on
trust me you wont regret itthis is nintendo at its best
by far one of the best system ever made
its just fun to play  with the system only costing  now you should definately get iti picked this system up a couple of days ago expansion pack included for  dollars
i also bought turok seeds of evil and perfect dark for under 
i also recently bought a couple of other vintage systems so you can say i enjoy the old games
while i have stated in other reviews that i will get a next gen sytem soon im still enjoying the oldies while this system may be outdated by todays standards dont be so quick to rule the n out
the graphics and sound for its time are not bad and the controller fits well in my hand
not a bad deal at allnintendo  is the best video game console in the world a true classic the best of the best all the n games rock games like super mario goldeneyethe turok trilogycastlevania star wars shadows of the empirekirby donkey kong jet force geminiboth zelda gamespaper mariomega man resident evil quest earthworm jim d and so much more buy this system if your a oldschool video game fan you wont be sorryoh my oh me the nintendo  game full pack i used have one a long time ago but i have a new nintendo  game system along with the other gamesi think most people can agree with me that this is arguably the best console of all time
the games are awesome and still today in  i love this console more than my xbox  or  my wii
the games just never get old and i love it
thanks nintendo for making this masterpiecethe system works incredibly well and i needed to beat mario  or i was sure to collapse hehe this is a great systemsure its old but i have had mine for like  yearsit still works perfectly and some of the games for it are better then half of the games out nowtherefor this is a great buythis is the best console you can get becides gamecube of course but if you do not use it all of the time like me get because the racing game are great for games i like san francisco rush san francisco rush  and california speedi really like this console
nintendo  is the best nintendo console they have made
i like it and everyone should have one because its funnintendo has to be one of the best systems ever and its all because of the games and the controllerthere are quite a few classic games for itplatformers like super mario racers like f zero xflight simulators like star fox puzzle games like tetris and dr mario shooters like doom  and role playing games like ocarina of timecall me crazy but i still think that this system has great graphics even by todays standardsthey may not be as stylish and pretty as x boxs or game cubes but they just look cooland the controller rocksits the perfect length and doesnt even get tangled up and it feels great in the handsand its worth it to buy it if youre a die hard mario fana die hard zelda fan or even a die hard f zero fan like mei got the  back in  or  i still have some of the games for it i like this console there were some awesome games to it wrestling  fps games are what come to mind like wreslemania   golden eye
the only flaw was the controller its terrible with fighting games ill admit it on fighting games ill have to go with ps or saturn
the only reason the  didnt get past the ps was cd technology there was a cd add on in japan it failed
when nintendo got it right with games like doom  zelda ocrina of time those games graphics could smoke whatever the ps put out
if you own a ps you should enjoy this
a few games i ownzelda ocrina of time golden eye the world is not enough doom wreslemania  a few i own  the  did well over  millon people cant be wrong good build quality solid games you can find this console for a decent pricemy favorite system of all time but heres an honest review
ive had an n for over  years
my best friend got it for his bday as well as goldeneye in   i was obsessed
i got mine in late  and it still works great
ive owned many systems in my day and n is definitely one of my faves
the games are excellent
some of the best video game series ever started on the n mario party mario tennis etc
while some continued donkey kong mario kart star fox etc
not including some of the greatest games ever goldeneye perfect dark mario kart  super mario  zelda ocarina of time star fox  etc
this system is a must have for any gamer
its the perfect multiplayer system
there are some pros and cons and here they arepros unique game series
excellent multiplayer system
very durable all around
unique controller
awesome gamescons not mature enough gamesbut thats nintendo for youdeal with it
you need too many accessories
although you can get away with just a memory card
my advice like its predecessors youll eventually have to blow on your games
control stick gets kinda crappy after lots of usagethe pros definitely outweigh the consif i didnt have an n id buy one in a heartbeat
my favorite system of all timethe console has worked perfectly so far
it shipped pretty quickly and the price was reasonable
i really appreciated the controller and game that were thrown inthe nintendo  was a pretty awesome console even though it hadnt quite mastered d graphics yet people had blocky heads and hands etc etc but there were some truly incredible titles for this platform such as goldeneye mariokart  and waverace  for its time the nintendo  was groundbreaking and even today its still a lot of fun to play despite the fact that later consoles ps wii smoothed out their d graphic technologylet me just say that this is a great system and totally worth every penny
the biggest complaints about this system are the lack of games bad sound and cartridges
well
first of all it is true that there are a lot less games on the n then on the playstation
but
look at the games
there are like twelve football games for the playstation
which one to pick
are any of them good
although nintendo may only have two football games you know that they will both be good
nintendo has mario zelda donkey kong kirby and pokemon
although nintendo has less games overall their games are better so you will end up having more fun with games that are really great
it is true that many of the games do not live up to their sound potential
but before you trash the system capabilities listen to the music of zelda or the dolby suround of donkey kong
just because many games do not have good sound does not mean that the system cant do it
many people complain about the cartrides
just think about what happens to a cd if you leave it on the floor and you will know why i like cartridges
one of the best things about the cartridges is that they do not take time to load
the one bad thing for some people is that nintendo is not very good in the rpg area
they have zelda and paper mario and that is pretty much it for the awesome rpgs
that is the one area in which playstation is better than none last thing to keep in mindit is not fair to compare n to ps xbox or dreamcast
those are nextgeneration systems comprable to gamecube not n
they are not in the same generation so of course it is not a good comparision
like comparing gameboy color to gameboy advance
it is just not fair
i hope this helps you to make the right choicenintendo   the name strikes fear in some people who are thinking of buying a good quality system
let me begin by saying that n is not bad at all n has a much better processor because it has bits of power psx only has   times faster than psx mb ram but with expansion pack it goes up to mb of ram psx only has mb ram and features a higher resolution than the psx
this is how the n is more powerful than the psx
this is not to say that psx is a bad system
one downfall to n is that it runs on cartridges
the n cartridges may store a lot more than all the other cartridgebased systems but it holds less than a cd and dvd
it can hold a max of mb while the psx can hold up to mb
this is the weakest point of the n
however with more system ram it can improve the already good graphics and make a game longer
another thing is that most psx owners will say that n cant have fmv full motion videos in the games
this is not ture
if you own resident evil  then you will know  what i am talking about
the only problem is that the fmv is a little less clear
since n runs on cartridges it takes longer for developers to make
so there are only around  n games while there are around  psx games
but with rare on nintendos side who needs as many games
all in all nintendo  is the best system besides gamecube ps and xbox it beats psx to the ground on everything except the game format
if n were on cds psx would have died a long time agobest console of its time
great games
great times
i will never get rid of this console againthe n is in my opinion the best console nintendo ever made
i am a old school gamer and i love old systems and the n is my favorite system
the graphics are excellent and everything is so smooth and sharp much better graphics than the ps
it has great games like starcraft  ogre battle  super mario  mario kart  star wars rogue squadron doom  shall i go on
also its very cheap you can pick one up for  why spend  for a xbox  or ps when you can get a n that has just as good games if not better than the newer systems get a n while you still cannintendo  is one of the coolest toys i have ever gotten
i love it
its so fun and you can get controllers with different colors
another thing i like about nintendo  is the fact that there is very wide variety of games
some of the best games are mario party  top gear rally  all star baseball  and mario kart  i also like it because it has different types of games like action racing sports puzzles adventure and more
i absolutely like nintendo  i would recommend to anyone who wants a cool video game consoleremember getting together for some  player  goldeneye
man those were the days
i owned an n and a ps growing up the ps platform featured all the best single player rpgs out there and n featured the best multiplayer for its time as well as some really awesome single player as well zelda
ive got to give nintendo props this is definitely a great system
perhaps my grand kids will pull it out of the attic in the future and ask whats this
ill just have to plug it in and show them one of the best gaming systems everi have had a n since early  from that time until late  i had purchased over  games
this system has served me well
in late  i bought a playstation  but its nothing like what the n was to me
i would spend hours a day playing banjokazooie super mario  goldeneye and others
and the games actully lasted long amounts of time
sure they didnt have as good cinamatics as the ps versions did but they lasted long
for example i beat banjokazooie in a course of a year and a half
then i beat spyro the dragon in  weeks
see my point
so even though i now have a ps itll never ever be anything like the n and even though they now have all these great new systems n will always be the greatesti shouldnt have to tell you this but go buy this game system
if you had to decide between a playstation and an n there is no doubt id buy an n
with at least  revolutionary titles and also being one of the first d consoles id say if you dont have this system or didnt in the past you simply did not have a childhood
in my opinion the s was the best decade of all time
and its because of this right here thank you japan thank you nintendo
you can get this for about  used
seriously
thats insanely cheap for something this great
buy it
nowfor those who remember this console quicker loading times than the ps a bit graphics pipeline the funky controllergames banjo kazooiebest game turok best graphics extreme g fastest game goldeneye best multiplayer blast corps best puzzle game pro evolution football best sports gameif you have never heard about these games go read about them and you will see why this console was important for games development
for everyone who had what is a silicion graphics sgi computer games box in    running  bit graphics then you know how good it was and how it is the games on this thing that made the ps all the more possible
some of these games are now leading developers todaythe only drawback was no cut scenes and nothing really long because the game was on a catridge
still this box was  bit graphics and you got that
even though it gathers dust now it is still a classic and integrel part of gaming evolutionbasically the n is now in storage and i have discovered project with rom emulation capabilities and you can have the whole collection of n games running on your pc
apparently this was around in  well before the n stopped producing games in  november  get itthe n for me represents the golden age of gaming
back when this console came out nearly every title released for it was a genuinely unique and fun game experience
the video games that were released on this console have very probably the single greatest range of different game systems you will ever encounter
there are dozens of distinct and unique platformers ranging from super mario  to rayman  some of the most beloved action and adventure games including the ocarina of time and majoras mask and most peoples first foray into first person shooters with golden eye and perfect darkthere are hundred of games available for this console and most of them can be found on amazoncom for under

long live nlaterthe nintendo  in my opinion was the best console nintendo ever madeand yes i did own a snes for a very long time untill it died on meand it is in my mind better then the nintendo gamecube
the console came out around  and launched some amazing games that im going to get into in just abit but first let me say that this is also one of my favorite consoles it had great games the quality and quantity were magneficent and just about everything about this console is great now how does it sum upsoundsome good some bad but in the end it was acctually far more worse then the playstationthe first of coursewhich was such a huge let down for some of the nintendo fans i mean ill be honest it was so mushy in some games its not even funny
its a shame cause most of the sound is what brings scores down for games in the gaming industryseriously it doesbut for me the amazing games just make up for itgraphicsumwere all of you as shocked as i was when we saw mario in a full d world
if your answe was yes then you are correct the visuals in n were far more superior then the playstaion and put out some of the best looking vidoe games of its timeand to me some games that are still good looking to this day
the visuals were just jaw dropping awe and looks of amazement for me
simply putnintendo scored big time in the graphics departure
it broke out of the d cartoony look and braught us new and excitingpretty looking games of  to memory cardi cant say much other then like the dreamcast vmu the memory card with rumble pack was just awesomenuff saidgames where the heck do i start
the games for the nintendo  were some of the best games ever created on a console
mario  to many and myself was a friggin legend beyond belief and was hailed to many as the best game ever made
when it comes to rpgs the games for n probably gets a paper mario and that was itbut in adventure departure it gets a  why
the games were friggin amazing
the console braught many many amazing games
golden eye perfect dark donkey kong  mario  the turok series conkers bad fur day rayman which was one of best platformers ive ever played banjo kazooie and many many more
those games let alone made nintendo  one of the best consoles ever madenext to the sega dreamcast
one huge reason in particular for why i loved the n was simply thisocarina of time
yes folks to me the legend of zelda ocarina of time was hands down the greatest video game ive ever played and was to me the greatest game of all time
it had an amazing story superb visuals and combat and amazing enviroments and everything about the game was just breathtaking and was let alone a system seller for me
another game in particular other then ocarina of time was the consoles last game that was released in  and that was conkers bad fur which was hands down another great gamemust own for the console it not only used parodies and dirty humor to bring the gameplay to life but the game itself was really good
but after that gamecube made its mark and n wasgonebut not for meeven today i still play that amazing system
though alot of people choose snes i choose this dont get me wrong the snes had some amazing gamessuch as donkey kong country and yoshis island which were amazing gamesbut i still choose the n over that console for somereason
if i had to name you the games system sellers it would be perfect dark goldeneye mario  rayman  conkers bfd and of course ocarina of time
yes for a one console that is alot of system sellersok im done ranting about the gamespricewhy do i bring this upwell for one thing the system and like  games would would be a total of  bucksheck maybe even lessand the fact that its really cheap now is another reason you should go out and buy this console
why spend  bucks on ps when you can get a n for  bucksthen again i own a ps so i should shut up for saying thatand some pretty amazing games for  bucksits a must have for back then and even now
go and get the consoleoverall one of the best console ever made with amazing games a cool looking controller great memory card and overall great everthingok im done rantingoverall   out of i love  i thought it was the best console when it came out in  i still play it even though ive got ps
has anyone ever played conkers bad fur day
it rocks on this consolejust bought this system to go back to the  player classics such as mario cart mario party and super smash bros i am a huge xbox  fan and still love this system but it is amazing how far video games have advanced in  yearsin a time where the internet is being seen by several people and consoles try to take advantage of it and those consoles would run on cds the nintendo  had arrived into the scene
it didnt run on cds but cartridges
it had no online support whatsoever
but you know what
it sold wellnintendo had once again revolutionized the gaming industry with their move of making the nintendo  how
because of super mario  one of the first games for the systemhaving  players instead of  add up to the fun that you would probably have when playing games like mario kart smash bros mario party and goldeneye exactly as ordered and better conditon than expected due to the age of this equipment
my  year old grandson found this himself and had me order it for him
this had brought him many hours of enjoymentnintendo may now be considered an outdated gaming system but in my mind it will always be the best
nintendo was the first system to introduce the joystick to the controller and has one of if not the best controllers ever made
this is the system that started the legacy of the james bond games with goldeneye continued and enhanced some of its super nintendo games such as starfox and mario kart
this also brought such great strategy games as starcraft and command and conquer to game console
it also made the legendary legend of zelda games superior even for modern times
it has made some of the best racing and sports games that never seise to entertain
in short nintendo is worth buying and i would even consider it over ps or xboxplain and simple this is the best game console out there untill nintendos next system comes out
it has by far the best games and no load times
nintendo is if you like to play old games then you need this system
has some of the best games ever created on it
if you think that you wont have fun with such an old consol think again
i have one right next to my xbox  and i play it just as muchi love it
i get to play all my old games
i even have my granddaughter playing donkey kong which she loves and shes only  years old
i am so glad i kept my games and got this systemthe only problem i had was that the controller that came with it didnt work very well so i brought anothher one and weve been playing ever sinceive had this for  years and it has not stopped working
buy this i got it for  dollars when it came out buy this its great and its got great gameswhen me and my sisters all moved out one of my sisters took the n so i bought a new one to replace it and still be able to play some of the games that were mine that she didnt taleyou may not know this but the n was  bitand it looks way better than the jaguarthe games that made me play the n were mario  mariokart  oot and mmafter the startling success of nintendos nes and super snes video game systems they had a tentative agreement with sony to introduce a discbased console to the public
when the deal fell through however sony decided to create the playstation while nintendo stuck with cartridges for one more goround
the battle proved to be roughly a draw if you can remember back to the actual period and not just remember the playstation hypeback then the console wars were all about two things graphics and games
unlike today where the graphics are so good that gameplay is brought into greater scrutiny it seemed as if every game provided some new advance or backpedal in those two crucial categories
here is how the n ratesgraphics clearly the playstation seems to have had the advantage in this category due to the larger memory space of a cdrom than a cartridge
however i would also challenge you to go back and play that original ps and tell me it doesnt look a little well goofy
it was almost as if sony had this great new technology but werent really sure how to utilize yet packing their games full of crazy motion wild colors and fastpaced action sequences
the n took a different approach
the graphics were a bit blocky but not nearly as overthetop as sonys
games like mario zelda goldeneye and perfect dark didnt have the sharp clarity of characters but they looked much more grounded or realistic
it just comes down to what looked better to yougames this is where the n had a huge advantage over the playstation
mario  mario kart both zelda games goldeneye and a few other also mentions dk perfect dark etc
all had huge fan bases that sony just could not satiate
the console wars hadnt quite devolved into who has the best firstperson shooter yet so gamers were still interested in adventure and racing contests
whereas nintendo had all those classics sonys hero was crash bandicoot
yepthus although the n might take a lot of flak these days i just wanted to set the record straight that in its day it was still a quality system that competed toothandnail with the original playstation due to its grounded graphics and franchise gameslet me put it straight for everyone
the nentendo  or n as i call it was the greatest system of its time and then some
not only was its technology super advanced for its time the game selection was outstanding
my mom and step dad bought me the system christmas of  with my first game being wcw vs nwo
i have had it ever since and still play it often and it has never had any problems with me
thats almost  years of playing
try doing that with a ps or i have had many games and wish i still had the original copies bought for me when i was young
but then the ps came out and i traded a lot of those games for sony garbage
some of the classic games ive owned or currently own werearesuper mario  my original copy from  still works and by far on of the best games in historystarfox  second favorite play it all the time stillwwf no mercy groundbreaking wrestling game of its timeconkers bad fur day most controversial game of all time until gta san andreaswcw vs nwo my first game and it still works great
star wars podracer this game is responsible for riding my motorcycle too faststar wars naboostar wars rouge squadronexcitebiketony hawks pro skaterthe list goes on and oncase in point n  best and most reliable system of all time
there will never be another like it
